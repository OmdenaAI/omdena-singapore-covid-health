i know it's rlly for the best and i know this is necessary to control the situation at hand but god i'm really sad and i will miss school so freaking much zzz i was thinking of how much i'll miss the canteen food and i also realized how much this situation must suck for those aunties and uncles, their livelihoods depend on us and now we're not even there to buy from them :/

5,SGExams,42555,[A Levels] NTU Biological Science with second major in medicinal chemistry and pharmacology OR NUS Chemistry with specialization in medicinal chemistry,htlcd3,immahugesimp,1595096467,6,11," I am torn between which to choose from, NTU or NUS. I dont really care about prestige, i just want a focused course that i can enroll in. Sadly, due to my IB score, these are the only two options that i can choose from; if not ideally, it would be pharmaceutical sciences in NUS.

My ideal career option would be research and development of drugs in a pharmaceutical company and potentially set up my own company making pharmaceutical drugs in Singapore (manufacturing). From young, i always wanted to do manufacturing and have interest in drugs, thus, i am really conflicted between the two degrees.

I got 2 questions that i need clarification;

1. Pathway to get a ""medicinal chem"" specialization degree between NTU and NUS.
2. Do i really need biology for my career pathway that i want? I feel like NTU course is abit off-track from what i want to do as it involves molecular biology and cell structure, which is totally unrelated to drug discovery and manufacturing in the pharma industry.

Based on my knowledge, I know that in NUS, you will need to study general chemistry till you are in your third year. Only then, you will get to choose your specialization (and it depends on your score). But in NTU, you will be in your second major course from the get-go, thus, dont have to fight for the ""specialization in medicinal chemistry"" title. This gives me more security, knowing that i can at least graduate with a second major, rather than a normal science degree. So, right now i am leaning more towards the NTU side.

However, i dont know if biology is really relevant in the future!

Both courses are the same number of years and but NTU is in life science and NUS is in school of chemistry.

Can somebody please help!!! I am in a HUGE dilemma now!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/htlcd3/a_levels_ntu_biological_science_with_second_major/,1.0,"['The NTU option sounds closer to what you want.  \n\n\nNot sure about NUS but NTU Chem only have 1 mod on biology.

6,SGExams,41749,[Junior College] Discussion of study methods + Seeking advice on how balance relationships with studies in JC,hq6o7i,throwaw4yforpwsurvey,1594605466,5,1,"For some context I'm a J1 student! :) Recently I've been in a little slump and feeling demotivated. My attention span has also became really really short so I'm considering deleting social media as it has made me crave instant gratification every few mins and sitting down to solve problems take very long and I have lost the patience for it.

My old study method:
- Plan everything I want to study in a day on Google Calendar and plan the exact times I'll do everything the day before 
- I kind of plan a week at a time (during CB i planned for the whole month)
- If i fail to complete it I shift it backwards

This method worked at first but I realised I get very demoralised when I fail to accomplish my plans and have to shift them backwards. Sometimes I also over or under-estimate how much time I need for each task. I also feel extra anxious and over-plan sometimes.  Honestly I feel like I plan for myself to study so much more (maybe 8hrs+ on non schl days) than my mental capacity allows.

I was just curious about how you guys study  (structure/ timetable? Or just whatever you feel like studying). It would be best if you're a J1 too but help from all ages is appreciated!!! :)

*Relationships*

I've been in a BGR for about 4 months and I'm honestly kind of worried that I'll be unable to balance my studies or get into some fight during exam season which might affect my results. However, so far we haven't fought much and the relationship is generally unproblematic. My partner is also understanding and the opposite of a toxic and problematic person and sometimes helps me with work. I also hope to be with him forever so I believe sacrificing some time and effort is worth it. Just wondering if any seniors/ people in my batch have any advice regarding dating in JC and how to make sure it doesn't affect your studies.

For some context im a 20yo guy in NS, going to NUS BIZ next year. Its been a rly painful year due to both COVID and my NS schedule. 

I have a friend (20F) that ive known and was close to since Sec 3 who's currently in y2 of NUS biz as well. Naturally, we drifted ever since she went to Uni. We had a big fight way back in June bc I rushed her into meeting to catch up when phase 2 started. She was busy with her internship and cca committments and rly didnt have time to catch up with me. So bc of that, she stopped replying my texts and basically removed me from her life, blocking me from her spam n stuff.

I spammed her and kept apologising desperately but despite that she still remained cold and unresponsive at times.

I was at fault for rushing things and making her feel awkward and stressed with trying to please me. As of now, things just arent the same anymore, even though she claims that shes not angry at me and that she stills sees me as a friend.

I dont know how stressful it is, i see many ppl in the same course enjoying life more than others. And not being in Uni yet means I can't rly relate well to her life and her mental state as well. She has btr friends in Uni, and tbh i feel that my time as her friend is over, but I still hope we can reconcile.

The easiest advice that ppl have given me is to forget abt her and move on, after all shes not my gf. But she was and still is an important person to me and it rly sucks to give up bc of one fight. What can I do in this situation? Can someone enlighten me on your experiences in Biz too? It'll help me alot.

9,SGExams,44806,[Uni] Why I Disliked Being in NUS Dentistry (Advice for Future Applicants),icnijz,NoBlankCheques,1597843274,213,1," 

Firstly, it might sound incredulous to many of you, but the NUS Dentistry is an incredibly oppressive place to be in. Students are expected to fall in line. Those who attract attention get themselves in trouble. I’ve often heard from my friends in medicine about how they are able to feedback to the school about the problems they face. I find it incredibly hard to see the day where the Faculty of Dentistry entertains student feedback. Every year, the school asks its students for feedback, and almost every year, student feedback participation is incredibly low. The school blames the students for being lazy and unresponsive, but has the school ever asked itself why this is so? Perhaps it is because students have realised that their feedback doesn’t even matter. Why would we feedback, when none of it is taken into consideration? Why should we respond to a survey that is dismissed by lecturers and supervisors who repeat the same cycle of top-down instruction every year?

Secondly, students and even junior staff are often called upon to respect the hierarchy. Even if you’re right, you’re wrong as long as your opinion clashes with someone who is more senior than you. I was taught to keep my head down in school, and so I did. Every time I was shouted at, scolded, spoken to like I’m a worthless bottom-feeder, I took the beating and laid low. To be fair, that kept me out of the radar just enough for me to slip out under. Afterall, none of us escape this place without getting scuffed up a little. It was a small price to pay to get out. I never really got the brunt of the beating, but some of my classmates were less fortunate. Those who challenged those in charge were punished, and they had their lives made difficult and some were retained as a result.

Thirdly, the school is a political minefield. Tensions exist within the staff, within the students, and between students and staff. Staff members who dislike each other often contradict one another either openly or subtly, and students get caught in the crossfire. This idea of a supervisor calling another supervisor’s plan stupid isn’t something that’s uncommon, although I think splurting out expletives isn’t a common sight these days. The patient might have caught a supervisor on a bad day. Most staff tend not to splurt expletives in front of patients, but they might not be so kind to students or even their junior staff in private. Even students sometime compete against one another in an ugly fight. Students are given very little resources to work with, thrown into seemingly impossible situations, and sometimes it turns into a dog eat dog world, where the fittest or most vicious survives.

Fourthly, the system of power and abuse is not only reflected in the way the faculty treats it students, but also its less “important” staff (which we completely disagree with – all members of the healthcare system must be treated equally). Janitors are ill-treated by the dental nurses – dental nurses have even chased janitors out of the pantry and banned them from using the fridge once. Recently, lab technicians have almost all quit the faculty due to how the management has abused them. As a result, students have lost the technician support they need to complete their denture and crown cases. I feel sorry for the students out there who are still studying, it was hard in our time, but it seems impossible in theirs right now. I hope the school manages to hire more labtechs to help all of these struggling kids.

Fifthly, students are placed under incredible stressful forces that no other dental school exerts. Did you know that Singaporean dental students are expected to source for their own patients they need to graduate? The school does send some our way, but the bulk of our patients have to be found ourselves. These include fillings, root canal therapy, gum disease, dentures, crowns and even surgical extractions. Have you ever tried looking for 3 patients who have completely no teeth amongst your friends and family? Zero teeth at all, it’s like trying to strike gold in a mud river. Students overseas do not have such pressure placed on them. They are given patients by the school, which deems it part of their job to supply students with the necessary patients to help them get sufficient training. This is not the case in Singapore. In Singapore, if you have no patients, you simply get retained, each year of unsubsidised school fee is about 100,000 SGD (29,000 subsidised), and each year of lost opportunity cost in terms of starting income comes up to about 60,000 SGD. Just imagine losing 90,000 SGD simply because you couldn’t find enough patients to work on. In the UK and Australia, students never worry about such things, simply because the school believes that it is its job to provide students with the resources they need to bolster their training. Yet, our elite world class institution fails to do so.

Sixthly, the insults and poor student treatment. Overseas, and even in local medical schools, teachers maintain a certain degree of respect for students. They are encouraged to ask, to learn, to enjoy their course of study. In NUS Dentistry, this does not seem to be the case. Here, there are stupid questions, there are stupid students, and there are also stupid students who ask too many stupid questions. Not all teachers are so mean, but a number of them are. They have given dental students nightmares for decades. Even dentists in their later years remember the days of being tortured in school by nasty individuals. If students are constantly afraid of being wrong, punished, marked through negative marking and kicked out of the clinic (when the patients are still on the dental chair), shouted at, reprimanded, called names, and stared at as if they were worthless, no authentic learning can possibly be achieved. Furthermore, members of the staff are known to constantly imply to students that those who step out of line will be punished, the worst threat being retention, since much of dentistry work is subjective.

Think of it this way, if you submit a work of art, some may think it’s great, and some may think it’s ugly, so the assessor has full autonomy to decide if you pass or fail. If you build a denture or a crown that is in accordance to the design that the assessor likes, you get a pass, but if the assessor does not like it, you fail. Inter-assessor difference depends on the varying school of thoughts. This is accepted in the faculty. However, this also gives supervisors and staff the autonomy to fail students based on subjective ideas and feelings. This means that the supervisor rarely needs to justify why the student has failed since much of it is subjective. (Also, students always walk into the final professional BDS exams, not knowing their CA marks, so nobody actually knows how much marks you need to score in your final exams to graduate. How you’re assessed is a complete mystery – with the exception of the ever-so-kind pedodontics and periodontic departments who always have their student's interests in mind)

Because of all this, it is dangerous to speak out. I know batchmates who have been disliked for whatever reason, be it speaking out, or doing things that displeases certain members of the staff and have been directly or indirectly retained for it. It’s an open secret that the faculty will punish whoever dares to challenge their authority. I thought I was lucky to be admitted to the school of dentistry until I saw the blatant abuses of power of those who have accumulated power for themselves over many years – something I never expected to see in Singapore.

Most students will be too afraid to speak up even if the media does approach them, and the school warns students against talking to the media. I hope that this letter from a senior and graduate will let all the struggling students out there know that they are not alone, to work hard, to strive on, and become the healthcare workers Singapore deserve.

Singapore has changed, the PAP has changed, the voices of the minority now matter, please let the voices and cries of the students in the Faculty of Dentistry and bitter graduates be heard.

11,SGExams,28437,[A levels] Retaking after A levels,f78o80,ghostreader123,1582276914,21,1,"Lmao this is probably the only thing I'm gonna post on this forum haha. This is specifically for those of you who may not have fared as well and may not have a good chance of getting into your desired course. I am writing this because I personally feel there is not much information out there regarding retaking and I just want to be of help :)

A year ago, upon receiving my results, I was speechless and my mind blanked. 66.25 RP. Realisation dawned on me that I could not enter the courses of my choice and this was followed by balling my eyes out for the next two days. I had to make a decision: poly? private uni? overseas? retake? A lot of factors came into play, such as time; cost; prestige (superficial i know) etc. Ultimately I decided to retake as it was the shortest route towards entering the big 3 local uni (with the course of choice).

Firstly, I had to retake it privately since I didn't fail any subjects and that meant I had to go for tuition classes. For my GP and H1 econs, I went for a group tuition. The tutor actually motivated me alot, as he always made me go for classes apart from the usual time slot to make up for the fact that I could not go to school. As such, I was always constantly writing essays, developing points and arguments, writing drafts to solidify my writing skills. Outside of his classes, i hardly put in time and effort for these 2 subjects because i have already put aside time to hone my skills in the tuition centre.

For my H2 subjects: Math, Chem, Physics, I went for 1-1 tuition. They were usually in a consultation style, whereby I would have done some work and I would go through the mistakes and queries with my tutors. This would force me in such a way to do work because I knew that i had to bring something for the consult. As such, I would download papers and practice.

Initially, when I just started, I felt that I did not know almost anything. As such, I downloaded a random prelim paper online and just tried it, closed book. It didn't matter how much I scored, I just wanted to know where i was at. (I scored like 10/80 or something lol). Then i would look at my mistakes and refer to the model answers and notes to see what I needed to supplement or correct and tried to understand those concepts. This was especially useful for chemistry and physics since there was alot of knowledge that one needed to know beforehand. For those concepts that I forgot or did not understand, along with questions that I didn't know why I was wrong, I would then ask my tutors.

This carried on for about 8months ( I started studying in April). Of course, it was a very lonely route. At times, I really felt like crying and giving up. But I would tell myself that, since I already made the decision, I should just persevere through the end. A 15min morning yoga and meditation session every morning, along with the continuous playing of motivational songs also helped. I would study at the Community Centre everyday since I felt that going to a certain location to study gave me a sense of purpose. Moreover, it was usually empty since everyone was at school so there was no need to fight for seats and I could concentrate there.

Cost wise, it was definitely quite expensive to retake the exam. I would say that I am more fortunate and blessed to come from a more well-to-do family so my father was willing to support my decision and pay from his pocket. However, I know for some other private candidates, they sought tutoring from their friends or school teachers, which is less costly.

Today, I received my results. To be honest, it is not the best score (76.25RP) but I am glad that I can go for the courses I want and have a wider variety of courses to choose from. Im just relieved that I have improved and I am really grateful to all the support from my family, friends and tutors. To those of you who may not have performed as well as expected this year, it may seem like the end of the world and you feel like you are stuck in limbo but I promise you, its not. Weigh your options and decide wisely. If you feel that you could have done better, maybe retaking might be an option? For me, I feel that even if I were to time travel back to results day last year, I would have ultimately made the same choice again without any regrets. As the proverb goes, 'All roads lead to Rome'. Retaking the exam as a private candidate may not have been the easiest one, but to me, it was still a worthwhile one.

12,SGExams,28037,[Poly] Singapore Polytechnic DTVM EAE,f4q37z,rejectedonce,1581856402,15,1,"Currently a 4E student taking O's this year. Been eyeing Singapore Polytechnic's Creative Writing for Digital TV and New Media (DTVM) course since around November/December last year. Today, decided to do a little bit more in-depth research on it, through online blogs, Reddit threads and Youtube videos. After gathering more information, I'm now determined to get into the course and would like to try to enter through the EAE process. However, I have a few concerns that sparked because of what I've read and heard from other sources. 

I think it's also important to state that I have quite a bit of experience in the field of Creative Writing (7 published short stories in local newspaper + SOTA Creative Writing Competition 2016 Finalist) and that I am also Malaysian (been studying in Singapore since Secondary 1) and have been interested in writing since young.

My first concern is that I am not in a CCA that really has any sort of the link to the course. I am from Robotics Club, and from what I have seen when researching, many of those who applied via EAE were either from Drama Club, Photography Club, Debate Club etc. Thus, I am quite worried they would ask me why I did not decide to join one of the above CCAs if I knew what I wanted to do from young. Additionally, they may ask why I did not decide to go for an Engineering course instead.

My second concern is that what I have in my portfolio is not enough to truly express my passion for writing and my determination to get into the course. Although I have 7 published short stories in my local newspaper, I have a feeling that they might just dismiss this achievement since the newspaper is a Malaysian one. Not sure if this is just me overthinking or if it's going to be a real problem. Other than that, I also have a certificate and an offer letter from SOTA (School of The Arts Singapore) from their 2016 Creative Writing Competition, and several debate certificates. Not sure if these help boost me up or not.

My third concern is about the interview. Heard that DTVM mostly holds group interviews and I'm afraid I'll be drowned out by the voices of the other interviewees. Not sure if the interview is turn-based, giving everyone a chance to speak, or if it's just a fight between the interviewees to have their voice heard.

My fourth concern is what I'll be learning in the course. Did a thorough readup on the different modules that are part of the course and can't lie, they really grabbed my attention. They seem quite interesting and I think they will help hone my writing skills as well. However, read a blogpost that it's impossible to obtain a GPA of 4.0 in the course. I'm going to be honest, as I'm writing this, I only know that GPA is like a sort of overall grade of a student, but I'm not sure how it affects you completely. In fact, this low probability of obtaining a GPA 4.0 actually made the author of the blogpost transfer to JC from DTVM (which terrifies me)

My final concern is that I would not be able to cope with the workload in the course. Heard that Polytechnic timetables are quite flexible and that class timings constantly change. However, this might actually be a problem for me since I still live in Malaysia and would probably still have to wake up the same time to get to school (3.45am) Not sure if this ""flexibility"" would help or take a toll on me, but heard that MAD courses have quite long school hours so that has me worried. To add on, I am aware that JC has a fixed timing for school everyday, but I do not like the idea of JC. Heard that it's similar to another 2 years of Secondary School, and I can't see myself doing this ""sit-in-a-classroom-and-listen-to-your-teacher-ramble-about-concepts-while-occasionally-dozing-off"" thing anymore. Also, read that CCAs in Poly last up until 9+ and that is a major red flag for me, because that would mean me reaching home at 11+ (I would still like to join a CCA though)

Not really a concern but also a concern (?) : Do Malaysians get lower priority for EAE?

So that's all that I'm really worried about. I still have about 3 and a half months before the EAE process starts in June, but I just decided to start thinking about what I really wanted to do in the future since almost everyone else is talking about it. The only topic in Secondary 4 is just ""Where do you want to go after Secondary education?"" So, yeah. If any Poly seniors could leave some comments that would be great. If any Poly seniors who EAE'd into DTVM could leave some comments that would be awesome, too.

13,SGExams,40515,[Rant] [A Levels] Tips for private candidates taking A Levels?,hhrjw8,summersmere,1593397515,12,4,"Hello! I’m a A Level private candidate, I’m taking PCME and I just took my Chinese 2 weeks ago. I’m currently going to a private school for this, I have no previous background in A Level, was in poly before this.

A Levels is in 4 months and I literally feel like I have no time to complete everything. Especially when I can’t really grasp the concepts still. I’ve spoken to my friends who used to go to JC and they all tell me it’s normal to do badly in school exams (some got many As in A Levels), although it makes me feel temporarily better I can’t help feeling really nervous after.

It feels like a really lonely fight imo, I don’t really have friends in school that I can really click with. I don’t have friends that’s taking A Levels as well that I can really talk to, most of them took them in JC.

I honestly feel like giving up (but well I can’t bc I’ve paid for it), a lot of times I question myself why I do this (even though I know it’s bc I really want to get to uni). I dread going to school and I really feel like crying when I wake up (I did, well, miss some lessons because of this) It doesn’t help that I get really scared and nervous whenever I look at my schoolwork and try to study wkjdfjhebrjd Also it makes me worried that I don’t have a solid portfolio, I’m not in any CCA as my school has really limited CCAs that doesn’t give you much exposure, I only have part-time job experiences (and creating a subreddit and moderating it but idk if it’ll sound pretty lame in a uni application since its still quite small)

So... I was wondering if anyone here was an A Level private candidate who took several subjects like me? How was it like for you and how did you get through this? Are my feelings valid lmao or am I just weak (when I tried talking to people I was told to stop whining and suck it up because this is normal and everyone goes through this so I tried to afterwards)?

14,SGExams,39646,[Rant] Burnout and Mental Health problems in JC,hces4u,throwaw4yforpwsurvey,1592623074,49,1,"In primary school, I was super slack and didn't have to study much, but I somehow scored decently and entered IP. In sec 1 and 2, I continued to be very slack, and for the first time in my life, failed some exams (failed lit in sec1 and history in sec 2). I didn't even know PEEL structure existed until Sec 2 lol. In sec 3, however, I entered a ""smart"" class because I mugged 1 month before sec 2 EOYs and scored decently. Since then, I began working hard and actually did well. However, I started to base a lot of my self-worth on my academic results. At the same time, I began to be super perfectionist for every aspect of my life, like working out and other stuff.  I also tried to become super disciplined with dieting after my exams ended, to the extent I was borderline having an ED (I think I went from around 45kg down to 40kg.) Despite all this, I didn't feel depressed or burnt out or whatsoever and I guess my competitive nature fuelled me to try to excel in ""everything"".  

In JC1 (this year), I decided to let myself go, and allow myself to eat some unhealthy food, and not study when I didn't feel like it. This led to me losing discipline and developing lots of unhealthy habits. I began sleeping in class and not doing tutorials at all. During HBL, however, I decided to try to get my shit together and I did. I began studying but it was way harder than I thought (afterall, I only started studying in May and had to relearn everything in a month). Now I procrastinate studying everyday and sometimes I sit down at my desk and begin crying for no reason. My lack of motivation for studying is just one of my problems amidst friendship and relationship problems (I don't fight with my friends but in my head I constantly feel like they hate me even though I know the don't). 

JCTs are coming up and I barely studied the past 2 weeks because my mind just keeps wandering to negative thoughts which led to me crying almost everyday. I feel pressured to do well because my new classmates heard from my secondary school friends that I was ""smart"" and I'm scared that when I get bad grades they will realise I'm actually just an imposter. And I'm scared my parents will realise I'm not the genius they thought I was (they were really proud of my secondary 3 and 4 results). 

I wake up feeling jaded because I feel like even after all this is over and after A Levels are over, I'm still going to be tired and feel suffocated. (Aside from academics, I constantly find myself questioning if I'm ""doing things right"" or ""living life right"") I'm not sure if I'm depressed or whatever and idk why I wrote this maybe I just want somewhere to vent. Part of me already knows I have to let go of this mentality (I always had this toxic mentality that I can ""achieve anything I set my mind to, and if I failed, it means I didn't try hard enough"") and it will benefit me mentally and of course, in the long run, because if I continue being so hard on myself I will just be sadder. But since like Sec 3 onwards, this harsh mentality is what helped me achieve things in life. 

I'm not sure if this is exactly coherent, I feel it's a mess all over but if you read everything, I'm really grateful :"") Just wanted to post it here because there might be people who relate.

15,SGExams,38606,[Rant] Emotionally distorted,h8ntqv,Aizxh3458,1592111810,15,9,"Quite a lengthy story. Anyone who reads this, thank you for your attention. 

In 2016, I was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa. Long story, I was a lonely kid in secondary school who has low social skills. I thought if I lose weight, I would obtain happiness and people will look at me differently. NOT. I just got skinnier and skinnier. I was like a stick. Sitting down was painful as my bones can be seen underneath a thin layer of skin. I was very hungry that I couldn't concentrate anything. I went to get psychiatrist help as my condition was getting worse. My psychiatrist sent me to psychological therapist.

I was given depressive meds as the psychiatrist found my mood often swings. I could go from content to agitated. Time didn't make it better...

O levels were approaching and I wasn't cured yet from the ED. I got L1R5 20 points in O levels.

I was devastated. I cried very hard on that day. My friends in my class didn't bother to ask how I was. They have the best results and are going to JC. My close friend from secondary one soon comforted me.

I thought I could choose the course I wanted, nutrition since the course numbers in my result slip stated so. The system ended up putting me in RP Clean Energy. WHICH I did not put in my course choices. 

I couldn't choose nutrition. I have to choose an engineering course. I come from a pure science background and the concepts were so foreign. Coming into poly life, I decided to change myself from the socially awkward kid to a friendly young adult. 

I engaged myself in conversation. I was able to talk on a one-to-one basis. Being a large group was quite terrifying for me. Nonetheless, I was glad to be in a group of girls in my class. Soon, drama erupted and the group split into two. 

Being in poly, it was a big struggle as I am constantly fighting with my ED. I have anxiety attacks. I felt left out in class as my friends find other people they considered close. They grew worse when my group leave me hanging. It deeply affected me emotionally.
I remembered rushing to the bathroom cubicle and sobbing hard. 

I become withdrawn from class and kept a lowkey profile. I felt like secondary school days are coming back to me. I constantly fight myself to maintain my conscience. I find myself slipping back to my old habits. I couldn't speak without stuttering. I didn't want to speak in my normal tone or else I would draw attention. I ducked my head down to avoid standing out. 

 I thought quitting poly as I didn't want to go back to class to see the people who left me. I chose nyp nursing since it was one of the courses that fit my o levels. I went through the DAE interview and got accepted. However, the teacher on the phone warned me something crucial.

All poly students are given ten subsided semesters. I completed four semesters and left with six semesters: three years. If I failed a semester in nyp, I would have to pay full amount. 

 I didn't want to risk my family finances. Yet I didn't want to go to class everyday, seeing people mingling around while I am left behind. It constantly mocks me how I was such a coward, I should have try harder so people won't leave me, how much of a failure I was back in the days. 
 
It's draining to keep a happy smile while everyone is surrounded with friends.

 I could keep up with the pace as I forced myself to study. I grouped with the minority in my class and carried the whole team. I got a gpa 3.02 in year two but it isn't sufficient for me. I wanted to study a course I wanted. Getting into a science course from an engineering background is going to be difficult as I competed with others who clearly have a better background.

Days goes by, year three came. I am in an elective class so I won't be able to meet with any of my former clique. However, I feel like my past is coming to haunt me. First semester was SIP. I was with two other interns. I decided that maybe I got a chance to restart and talk to them. 

Then the pandemic comes. SIP got postponed. I quarantined for two months while doing hbl. My medication ran out of supply. My doctor appointments got postponed. My mood grew worse as I struck in these four walls. 

The CB lifted and the company stated that we could come back. I dreaded the coming days till graduation. 

I tried to talk with the two interns. Most of the conversation were between the two of them while I was like the third wheel. I began to feel self-conscious. I began to analyze their body language and conversation. Their eye contact and the way they speak.

I don't know why was I even trying hard. I just don't want to be left hanging like in the past. 

Then everything comes down. Tension built between us. 
I don't know why but I couldn't talk with one of them... I tried hard to initiate like giving sweets or having lunch.. 

What hits me hard when I saw them leaving. I was closing my workspace. There's only one entrance in the office. 
I saw them walking to the exit. One of them as excepted didn't look at me. Another just stared at me, shocked or speechless. They continued their way without saying anything to me. I didn't utter also because...I was scarred. All the past memories came crashing on me. My hopes to make friends vanished. 

I am tired of trying and losing again. I dreaded going back the next day. I tried to ask my teacher to change my SIP company. Due to the ongoing pandemic, many companies terminated students.hence there is no more slots. 

I don't know what to say or do when I see them tomorrow. I don't want to go through another pain. I don't know why am I reacting so sensitive. I admired anyone who gone through shit and came out like a badass. I didn't have the strength to face people.

I feared my future. I have to face people again. Any social interaction fails triggers my pathetic self. I find myself having more panic attacks. I couldn't breath. I couldn't sleep. I guess you could say I am constantly on the edge? Everything is coming to me back and forth. I can't seem to contain.

17,SGExams,37899,[A Levels] Why Is A Level Physics Hard?,gxrynd,IngelSoong,1591453689,1,1," 

# Why Is A Level Physics Hard?

[A Level Physics](https://ingelsoong.com/why-is-a-level-physics-hard/) will be harder because assumptions and simplifications are gradually being removed to resemble real-world scenarios.

Compared to O Level, there is a steep increase in the learning curve.

This is only natural.

Having now graduated from the top 20% of the O Level cohort, the syllabus is now made much tougher to further differentiate among all of you.

Simplification of Real World

Learning new concepts always start by trimming away the complexities.

For Physics, one of the items that complicate the maths will be friction.

So O Level Physics and to a certain extent A Level Physics always assumes a frictionless world. 

Objects in motion, in the absence of friction, have to move forever.

But this comes as a cost as such assumptions does not gel very well with the real world.

On one hand you are told Physics aim to help you understand our physical world. 

Yet on the other, you have to fight to resist the idea that you are forced to study something that appears to be blatantly incorrect.

Misleading Stories

Fake narratives like the famous Galileo’s experiment where he dropped a feather and cannonball simultaneously and found both to land on the ground at the same time confuses many Physics students.

“I thought there is supposed to be air resistance? How could this happen, when the terminal velocity of the feather is lower than that of a cannonball?”

Gravitational Energy Formula

In A Level you will learn that GPE = mgh is nothing but a simplification when g is assumed to be constant. 

Where gravitation field strengths changes in vast distances the GPE = mgh formula will break down and cannot be used.

More Complex Concepts

As you progress in your education, more complicated concepts being introduced. 

Concept of Field

The concept of fields, such as the gravitational field, magnetic field, and the electric field is confusing because you cannot see them directly. 

However, we can experience them either directly, through the effects of gravity or indirectly where you observe things move at distance from a force.

Free-body Diagram

Learning to draw free-body diagrams can be a pain because you need to account for all the forces and their directions.

Students also find it hard to relate that frictional and normal contact force are components of reaction force.

Furthermore, it is also hard for some to understand Newton’s Third Law where the action-reaction forces do not cancel each other out, since we cannot feel the force we impact on other objects.

Quantum Physics

The need to start introducing the 21st century’s Quantum Physics may be repulsive for some when it is juxtaposed against 17th century’s Newtonian Physics in the same syllabus.

Imagine you have been rigorously studied Newtonian Physics and finally accepted it despite living in a world where friction exists, only to find out that it is not the gold standard for Physics.

New concepts such as wave-particle duality where waves can behave like particles and vice versa, or mass-energy equivalence, where lost in mass can produce energy are mind-blowing.

You have learned first about magnetism, then electricity, and finally the confluence of both leading to the phenomenon of electromagnetism. 

Yet we should not avoid understanding this topic because the discovery of electromagnetism vastly improves our standards of living.

So in some sense, students should pray Quantum Gravity, linking quantum and gravity will never be established.

The Need to Handle Mathematics

Students often complain about the presence of mathematics in Physics, such as Calculus topics like differentiation and integration.

The frustration arises because they are not adequately trained on techniques such as chain rule when used in the derivation of force as the rate of change of momentum.

So students tend to memorize the laws line by line rather than attempting to derive the final formula through derivation from first principles.

Mathematics as a subject exists in the compilation of common techniques to help solve problems in sciences.

For example, did you know Fleming’s Left Hand and Right-Hand rule exists from the cross product? 

The cosine theta in W = F s cosθ exists because of the dot product.

Same for the magnetic flux formula Φ = B A cosθ.

[Formula list](https://ingelsoong.com/a-level-h2-physics-data-booklet-formula-sheet/) like this might only help to a certain extent.

Context-Dependent Sign ConventionsNegative Signs

Negative signs when used in Physics can be extremely confusing. 

On one hand, when used in vectors they can indicate directions.

At times, they are employed to describe attractive forces, as in the case of gravitational forces.

Yet it can also be used to mean a decrease in scalar quantities such as energy.

No wonder A Level Physics can be confusing.

Negative Acceleration

The term “negative acceleration” is used in some Physics textbooks.

But the use of this term can mean different things when used in different contexts.

If you have set right as the positive convention, negative acceleration can mean deceleration in the right direction, or it can mean accelerating in the left direction.

In one case you are gaining speed while in another, you are losing speed.

1st Law of Thermodynamics

The 1st Law of Thermodynamics can be very confusing to some due to the way work is done W is defined. Should it be work is done on the system, or work done by the system. 

Also, when will the negative sign be attached to W?

That effectively means there could be four permutations as to how it can be interpreted.

By the way, Wikipedia defines the first law to be U = Q – W

Where W is the work done by the system, adding to more confusion. 

The correct way would be to think of how internal energy can be increased through the input of thermal energy plus work done on the system.

Staying Conventional 

The part about having discovered that direction for conventional current is actually “wrong” can make some feel uncomfortable.

Temperature Scale

Similarly, students tend to feel uncomfortable on the now preferred use of the Kelvin scale over Celsius, despite the widespread use of Celsius or Fahrenheit. 

Electromotive Force

What exactly is the electromotive force? A force, or an energy source?

Legacy terms that can lead to so much confusion should be deprecated.

Heat Energy

Just like there is no current energy, there should not be heat energy. 

Make a conscious effort to use thermal energy instead.

Formalized Explanations

Because textbooks tend to be formal, certain concepts can be hard to understand. 

It will be so much easier to explain why voltages in the parallel circuit have to be the same by illustrating the concepts differently.

It would be easier to understand that voltages are the quantity of energy carried by one Coulomb of charge and that any charges could only take one of the branching paths to travel around the circuit.

Since all the charges are pumped up by the e.m.f. with the same energy initially, charges in all the branches must have the same voltages. 

To explain why adding a resistor in parallel, no matter how large, always decreases the effective resistance.

Say you are queuing up in a fast-food restaurant with only an ordering counter and a super long queue.

Despite manning by a super-efficient staff, the queue does not seem to move.

If a second counter is open now but manned by a newer and much slower staff, would you agree that this will still help in shortening the overall waiting time, albeit only by a little?

Hence, putting another resistor (even one with super high resistance) in parallel to the first always decreases the overall resistance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gxrynd/a_levels_why_is_a_level_physics_hard/,1.0,['Holy shit.']

some of the reasons why i did not do so well for promos is because i was used to the secondary school lifestyle where i can study last min and still do pretty well, mental health issues and a plethora of other reasons. regardless of what my reasons were, i know i did not put in as much effort as most of my peers in studying for my promos, and that if i truly did give it my 100%, i would’ve done at least averagely well. so honestly, i was okay with the idea of retaining because i think that spending an extra year in jc to get good a level results is a worthy trade-off.

here come the problems. 

the one that is the biggest thorn in my side is my family. my parents do not have the best relationship, and intend on getting a divorce after i graduate from uni. they constantly fight over my academic performance and financial issues. when i broke the news to them that i would be spending an extra year in jc, they got furious over the fact that they would have to pay even more for my school fees and that i would ‘disgrace’ the family. they argue that i used to be a bright student in primary school and lower sec, and i’m a ‘smart’ child. they believe that if i really wanted to, i could’ve done so much better for promos, hence they think i should advance. 

secondly, i have social anxiety. i used to be a very extroverted person who could befriend almost anyone i wanted to. i used to thrive off social interactions with others, and never imagined the day that i would purposefully avoid making new connections. recently, due to some personal issues, i get very emotionally drained and anxious when i’m around new people. it took me a long time to trust my current jc friends and let them in, so i don’t know how i am going to cope with an entire new class and cca. 

lastly, being a procrastinator who is in a bad place (emotionally), i fear that spending an extra year in jc would not help me. i am willing to sacrifice my friends and social life, but i’m terrified of the possibility that i will just waste the extra year away and lose everything. in that case, i’d rather force myself to promote to j2 and let the stress of a levels push me to work harder.

21,SGExams,55070,[A Levels] Be proud of yourself,jrdma0,greenteawithaloevera,1604980017,8,1,"Hi so uh I’m new to reddit (literally found out about it after my friend showed me an exam megathread after one of the a level papers), so I don’t really know how the format works please forgive and tell me if I screwed something.

Anyways, I would just like to share a bit of my experience so far and contribute some of my thoughts.

So I’m starting off a little heavy sorry but yeah I’ve been struggling a lot with mental health issues this year. It started years ago and I was really proud of myself when I fought through some really tough times and became a better person (weird coming from myself). So when the panic attacks and breakdowns came tumbling back this year, I was so disappointed and angry with myself and it really hit me hard. But I think that disappointment made me really look at myself and want to change back to that happier person again, so I’m doing my best to get through this A levels period.

I still don’t know what I was or what I am fighting through it for, what’s the point of all my studying and trying to achieve things, but maybe I’m just working towards becoming prouder of myself again.

So I think that in this period where many are experiencing more downs than ups, where it seems to all be pointless and bleak, maybe we should try to find one thing to be proud of ourselves for.

I’m proud that I haven’t had a panic attack in this last month, that I was able to fight through the stress and awful thoughts and focus on the small little things every day, whether it’s a joke during the study calls with my friends, or going out to eat my favourite food. And even if you aren’t able to overcome these thoughts most of the time, that’s ok. And even if you didn’t study as much as you think you should, that’s ok. You still read through those notes, you still did that paper even when you really didn’t want to, when you were sick of all this exam crap. Even if you didn’t, you brought yourself to that exam hall and did the paper. Whatever the case is, if you’re reading this, be proud that you are reading this because you are still here, fighting even if you’re struggling to fight.

There are many things that bring us disappointment, sadness, anger. And they are almost always overwhelming and seemingly impossible to overcome. We may not be able to see the other side of the wall that these things have built, but let’s not make it the only thing we look at. Let’s focus on the little achievements we make everyday, on the little moments that we smile at.

So I’m still gonna say this at the risk of sounding overly optimistic and idealistic. Be proud of yourself today because even if it’s so hard to do, I find it the most rewarding.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jrdma0/a_levels_be_proud_of_yourself/,1.0,['Very well said!

22,SGExams,54979,[A Levels] Modern Day Competition,jqoxr1,tengyang_x,1604888313,43,1,"just some thoughts after years in an IP school. some context : i was in tripsci in y3-4, and somehow landed myself in one of the top few classes. y5-6, 4H2 PCME, and found myself in a class which often made it to the top in physics, chem and math.

and somehow, i got thrown to the very deep end of ""mugger culture"" and made very interesting discoveries. 

""I NV STUDY""
competition nowadays isn't ""bro i studied 12hrs yesterday wbu?"" but ""damn i NV study. i'm GONNA FAIL"" and post on insta abt how bad the paper was. we all know (too well) what results that bastard gets. and then comes the reverberating ""SAME"" from like 3/4 other people. 

it kind of pisses me off sometimes especially since i wasn't doing very well (rp 30+) at the start of this year even though i rly tried so hard while they all score so well. i was juggling a ton of events (literally had 2 performances &amp; 1 external VIA) and a truckload of stuff at the start of J2. it seems like nowadays, ""admired"" are those who don't study while people who study hard are looked down on. little credit is given for effort while not giving a damn about your studies is seen as desirable. the kind of encouragement &amp; teamwork for studies in my parents' days don't seem to exist. this sort of environment created by us is inherently toxic. and insanely painful for those finding themselves on the left side of the bell curve.  

""MUGGER la"" 
ain't this phrase commonplace as heck. calling people muggers for putting in their best. what's the intention of this? perhaps, an attempt to bring others down. perhaps, pushing others down to make yourself feel better for the 4 less papers you did. those who actually put in effort are not just FROWNED upon but they are actively shunned. society has evolved and attacks don't go like ""ew this guy is disgusting "" but go indirectly like ""this guy is a mugger"". society has evolved until our perception of studying has become something negative &amp; undesirable. but again, those who label others as muggers just go home and study their ass off, and bc they know they've studied, they don't study in school. that's competition right there. 

slowly i learnt to adapt to such a culture. was tough in y3-5 but got better in JC2. in feb or so i looked at my 38rp result slip and just wanted to kms &amp; called myself dumb and everyth. it's at that point in time i decided i needed to do SOMETHING cus this wasn't gg to work out. at the same time i made a decision to work towards getting into medicine in university, a course i always wanted but never thought i could reach it bc my grades were too trash. i don't believe that i was that dumb. so from then on i decided to work hard. ran into every single attack possible. ""why u study so hard"" ""don't mug alr leh"" ""go home then study la play game first"". chose to ignore all those and told them ""my grades too bad alr man i need study"" and continued. studied my ass of during CB, and took most of my recess times to do extra papers when we got back to school. it was legit tough to do so bc everyone would question why i worked so hard. i just said ""now alevel u don't mug u do what?"" and i knew deep down i only had one goal which i didn't tell many about cus it felt embarrassing to aim for smt like that. cus of that my grades saw a little improvement. jumped to 69 in myes, and managed to add another 12 in prelims. point of saying this is that it worked to ignore the comments. to all those drowning in society's pressures, try to ignore it. ditch the competition and toxicity and compare w yourself. ultimately you're making yourself happy. not the rest. if you really want smt, go for it and don't stop at anything cus we'll see who gets the last laugh! if no one does, let me admire you for your effort, and tell u that having perseverance is a quality in its own. no matter what your results are, be glad you did ur best. no regrets, keep ur head up son. 

such environments only make academics a lonely fight. it is no wonder many get anxiety attacks, cry in the middle of school and take anti-depressants to get by. bc school is tough, and a competitive environment just makes it worse. together with expectations from typical asian parents, it's a recipe for a mental (and physical) health disaster. count yourself lucky if you're doing well, but do have some empathy for those trying their best. 

till then, to all d haters i nv gave an answer to, i mugged bc bitch, i'm gonna make my dreams come true.

24,SGExams,53582,[A Level] Really bad class environment. Should I transfer?,jm246m,starch-potato,1604236885,18,1," 

Hello! Thank you so much for clicking into this post.

I am currently in JC1  and I wish to ask whether I could transfer to other JCs. But I'm not very sure whether I should either, due to my clouded judgement right now. I am in the Science Stream taking PCMe. I wish to transfer due to various reasons.

My class environment is really unconducive. It is a mix of people who don't care about studies, talk back to the teachers and frequently have drama within and out of the class for reasons such as picking fights because of their PSLE score, having 5 instead of 4 fans or literally strangers walking by the class. There is a small proportion of students (like 1-2 people including me) who actually cares and want to study. There is so so so much hate within the class, every day there's a new fight, a new drama and it seems like people are being roped in even when they don't even talk to them. People could be hurdling swear words (to pick fights) and insulting each other or even push each other while they're shouting and arguing, but the CT (home tutor) wouldn't even bother and simply watch the fight unfolds. They could be insulting the tutors IN THE said tutors class loudly and think it isn't their fault when reprimanded (though most of the time they get away with no punishment).  
Furthermore, they would continuously ""correct"" the teachers and stop the class, but more frequently than not, they're the one in the wrong (in which they would then put up the ""the notes is wrong"" kind of attitude and refuse to admit wrong). After they were correct, they will get upset and mad??? and start scolding random classmates to vent their anger. They even have multiple group chats dedicated to roasting/insulting their own classmates. They are really judgemental and looks are crucial in their eyes -- having pimples or whatnot and they would constantly make fun of you etc. A few are retaining but the toxicity and hatred still remain. I struggle to remain focus and tried to escape the drama but it is really exhausting. To give an example of bad conduct, the combined late coming for my class (20 people) is roughly 150 late comings with 5 serious disciplinary cases for driving cars. We are one of the worst-performing class in the school but no one is motivated to change.  
Lastly, the tutors don't really care about the class either after so many fights with the class. They seem to have lost hope/motivation in teaching our class. They don't even bother to let us have consultations because ""the class don't deserve it"". Thus, I also was unable to get consultations about harder questions and I have no one else to ask for help... People would say you could ask your J2 seniors but because of covid, I don't have any CCA sections with my seniors at all. I spend most of the time studying on my own with the lecture notes but as I'm getting to J2, I'm getting more concerned whether I could push through another year of toxicity and pain.

There are other reasons but these are the main ones. If it helps, my promo result is AAB/A. With the aforementioned reasons, should I transfer to other schools? I am considering CJC or ASRJC.

27,SGExams,49636,[Rant] Withdrawing from JC might be my biggest regret,j7uyz0,p0lymerasechainrxn,1602230399,24,1,"
This is going to be all over the place because, well, I am all over the place as well ha so I apologise for any brain cells that you may lose after reading my rant. 

Basically, I withdrew from jc just weeks in, without giving myself time to adjust and let fear drive me away. I’m in poly now, just floating in a sea inferiority. 

Poly life for me is like drinking lukewarm water. The difficult and stressful times are then like eating something so spicy you don’t taste anything anymore. All you feel is your tongue burning, no flavor, nothing, just a one dimensional feeling. That’s it. That’s all I’ve been feeling for the past three semesters. And I probably will still feel the same way for the remaining three semesters. 

I’ve come to realise that in poly I haven’t gotten the chance to actually fully spread my wings and take that leap of faith to try and fly, and to be very honest, I don’t think I ever will. Sure, if I can’t try to fly then I probably won’t ever fall and land on my face but is that really what I want? Do I really just want to stay stagnant and not grow from failure? (Sounds ironic because I guess you could say this whole rant describes my one big failure.) My journey in poly is half over and yet I still feel unfulfilled academically and holistically. I can’t seem to find any opportunities to grow and develop myself into a better me or push me to be the best version of myself which was readily available in the jc I was in. In addition, despite paying 1.5k a semester, I also feel like the resources we get are lacking more often than not. I feel so insecure even when poly is supposed to be more specialised in the sense that you learn stuff about the field you’ve chosen a lot more in depth than you could’ve in jc. But nope. I feel like everything single thing I learn is so haphazard and incomplete. It’s like yeah we may know a lot but it’s all surface knowledge and definitely not enough to fully grasp or internalise the concepts. 

I always tell myself that hey you left jc to pursue something you wanted.(In hindsight, something I thought I wanted.) But, as explained above, yeah that’s just to make myself feel better. I honestly do not know if what I’ve learnt and will be learning in poly is worth missing out on all the other stuff I would’ve learnt if I stayed in jc. I also know deep down that the real reason I left was because I was terrified. I was a wuss who ran away the first chance I got. 

Also, no, I am in no way looking down on my fellow poly kids. Y’all are like amazing having to go through tons of submissions every semester no matter which school and course you’re in and especially last semester given HBL. Not to mention that whole cumulative gpa shit. One mishap and were basically dead. Screw anyone who tries to belittle you when you talk about how stressed you are and some elitist jc imbecile goes oh you haven’t experienced real stress because you aren’t taking A levels. 

I’m feeling all this just because I happened to see all my jc friends celebrating their grad day today. It’s like a reminder: hey this is what you could’ve experienced, what you would’ve experienced if you stood your ground, bit the bullet and stayed in jc. This was the community you could’ve been part of. This was the experience you deprived yourself of by running away. I wouldn’t say it’s fomo but fomo amplified exponentially. Every story I see of my jc friends is a constant reminder of everything I’ve missed out on just because I was scared in the beginning. All these experiences I’ve witnessed, both the good and the bad, I’ve never and probably will never experience where I am now and that sucks. Sure I have friends and I am so grateful for them. But they’re neither the kind of friends I had back in secondary school nor the type of friends I made in jc or those my friends have made. Seeing them sticking it out through thick and thin together makes me so glad that my friends are lucky enough to have such a strong support system that A levels have nothing on but also it makes me feel so regretful that that was the kind of community I gave up when I left my jc because no such system exists where I am now. The journey I’m going through in poly feels like a very lonely battle that I have to fight on my own without anyone to back me up or anyone to rely on. It gets kinda lonely. With all that, sometimes I just go: damn I really missed out on a lot huh. 

It probably sounds like I’m being a little bitch and complaining like a child. I can see that yes I understand so I’m not usually like this. It’s been months which is why I’d like to think I’ve gotten over everything and am only looking forward. It rarely rains I guess. I really kinda do feel dead inside. However, when it does rain, it pours. 

I know there’s no one else to blame but myself. I know that it’s no one else’s fault but my own. And I also know no one is harder on me about all this than myself which sucks. It really does suck that I beat myself up over and over again about the same thing even when it’s been months. I, more than anyone else, would like to just put everything that’s happened in the past but I can’t seem to. I try my very best to shove all these feelings down my throat and swallow it but ever so often I just throw it all back up, making a huge mess that I have to clean up. It’s one endless vicious cycle that I can’t escape. 

One good thing that came out from all of this is that when I realised I may have made a mistake, I tried to rectify it. Although that mistake wasn’t actually rectified, I take comfort in the fact that I already did try my best so no regrets about that. When I tell myself that however, it eventually leads to my brain saying well if you think about it you wouldn’t have had to rectify your mistake if you didn’t make the mistake in the first place. And we’re back to square one. 

As of now, I’d say withdrawing from jc might be my biggest regret. It has created such an overwhelming sense of inferiority in me that will probably follow me for the rest of my life. Praying and hoping that one day I get over it. 

So yeah that’s about it.

Nonetheless, to all J2s, happy grad! 🥳 All the best for As!

&amp;#x200B;

Some of y'all may remember me as one of the co-writers of the 2-part PCME study guide posted here a while back *(if haven't seen them yet, they're pinned under my profile!)*. Don't worry, I'm not going to talk any more about PCME, I'm done with that. I'm here with some final words of encouragement for all of you, yes including you O-Level kiddos. These are more... intangible things? that I have learned from my experience at A's. I've tried to write in a more narrative way to make it easier to read through, but I apologise in advance if I made you cringe instead of feeling better! Here goes...

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. You don’t have to shoulder this alone

During this stressful lead-up to the exams, it’s all too easy to lose sight of the people around you. Every fact, statistic or formula you remember displaces from your memory a friend in need or a shoulder you can lean on. You forget that your friends are struggling alongside you, that tens of thousands of other students are fighting your same battle, and that you are not alone. 

As you continue preparing for the exams, do remember to check on the people you care for. 

Be generous and forthcoming with your guidance, because every little gesture goes a long way in an environment where everyone is fixated on their own outcomes. Plus, teaching others is one of the best ways of revising, so what you have is really just a win-win situation.

Do not be afraid to reach out for help, because most people will be glad to lend a helping hand.  If it seems like people are reluctant, chances are it’s because your own needs become less salient when everyone else is facing similar problems. They get stressed and have bad days too, just like us. Be patient and forgiving, and never close yourself off.

Even if it may not feel like it, you do have people around you. It doesn’t matter if it’s family, friends, teachers, a significant other, or other SGExams users in the same boat as you. As you continue cramming your head with information, remember to vacate some space for these people that you care about. You don’t have to shoulder all this weight alone.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Let it unravel before you

If you are like me, you must be familiar with the episodes of crippling anxiety when the entire combined weight of the futility of your two years (or four years for O-levels) of hard work, the impossibility of the exams, and the hopelessness of your near future seem to be pressing down on you all at once. And you probably also know that these episodes are *not fun.* 

Though, there is something I’ve realised during some of my darkest times:

There are certain things we can control, and for every one thing we can control, there are many more things that we cannot. Acknowledge and accept your fears; they are completely valid. Once you have accepted them, though, you have to loosen your grasp on them and let them go. 

Maybe you just don’t have enough time to complete your revision. Maybe the dreaded insomnia sneaks up on you and your mind goes completely blank during your best paper. Maybe you won’t get your desired grades, let alone your dream University (or school).

All the worries in your head are not unfounded and you are justified in feeling the way you do, but also realise that these things are well beyond your control. Mulling over them will only cloud your vision and prevent you from performing at your complete, unbridled best.

If you shift your focus to the things that are within your control, like how productive you are or how much sleep you get each day, everything becomes more manageable. You’d be surprised at how much progress you can make once you give these controllable factors your undivided attention.

During these moments when you are at your lowest, let everything you’ve painstakingly woven together unravel slowly before you. Let your efforts go to waste. Let the dreaded days come and go. Let what you are most afraid of wash over and engulf you, and emerge renewed from it.  “Come what may”, or... something like that.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Do not go down without a fight

*“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.”* 

So what if you have been procrastinating a lot? If people have already started way before you and it seems like you’re late? You may have missed that proverbial “best time to plant a tree”, and each passing day you delay your starting is another missed opportunity, but the fact remains that the *next best time* is the present. In times like these when you don’t have much of a choice, the second-best option seems pretty appealing.

*“Do not go gentle into that good night.”*

In exams, we are often unsure of our answers, and it would take an unlimited number of second-guesses, or the running out of prescribed exam time - whichever comes first - to force us to make a decision. Other times, the only thing that we are certain of is that we are *completely* and *utterly screwed*, and that no amount of divine intervention can save us.

Even if you know for a fact that everything is going down in flames, you do not go down without a fight. Sometimes, the more convinced you are of your failure, the more you struggle against it. You will fight down to your last breath, because it is better to do so than to give in sheepishly and let all your years of hard work dissolve before you.

Two things define us: one, the unrelenting courage to take what we perceive to be a lost fight straight on; and two, the dogged defiance we show in the face of an inevitability.

It doesn’t matter how little time you have left, or what mountainous tasks lie ahead of you. If you start now and give it your all, you should be proud of yourself regardless of the outcome, because you have shown that unique tenacity which makes us human.

There is no “lost cause” or “foregone conclusion” when you are still fighting. The eventual outcomes are uncontrollables. What you can control is whether you go gently into the good night, or rage against it.

*“Lose the battle, win the war.”*

A short but necessary disclaimer: there are times when you have to take your losses and give in. Know your limits - there are certain fundamental, inviolable “rights” that every pitiable student reserves, namely to sleep and to take a break when needed. If you are tired from studying, order a retreat and head to bed, and continue the battle the next day. If you burn out, embrace your loss graciously, take a well-deserved break and have some fun, and then resume the campaign once your fire has rekindled. When it comes to the long haul, though, you give nothing short of your very best.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Fake it till you make it

It’s difficult to be confident when you feel like you’re the only one flailing about the water while everyone else effortlessly remains afloat. You have somehow fallen off an unsinkable ship while the rest on board continue merrily on their journey. 

I can ask you to be confident in yourself, but “easier said than done” would be a massive understatement here. How can you be confident when you’ve been failing all along? When everything you do turns out to be a mistake? When your classmates or friends outperform you at virtually everything that can be compared?

Sometimes, the only way to be confident is to fake it till you make it. Quite literally, you pretend that you are confident, and act exactly like how a confident person would. Yes, this sounds like a steaming pile of bullshit, but hear me out:

Tell yourself each day that you can make it, even if these blatant lies leave a bitter aftertaste in your mouth. Stop asking around and comparing your grades or answers with others, and be certain of your own abilities, even if you know for sure that comparing would reveal your inferiority. Walk into the exam hall with your head held high and shoulders squared, even if you feel like the least prepared person in that hall.

Over time, this false confidence becomes an acquired habit, and something you can call your own. It’s weird, but it’s much easier to develop confidence intrinsically once doing “confident things” has become second nature.

You are not someone who has fallen off the ship; you are your own vessel carving your own path through the waves. You are still perfectly fine even if everyone else has given up on you, because the most important person is yourself: you are the only constant among many variables as you face different adversities in life. The day that you forsake yourself is the day that you lose your best friend and your voice.

Let your self-confidence outshine the combined disapproval and scepticism of your non-believers. You can go farther than you can ever imagine; much, much farther than your wildest dreams.

5. Tara Westover’s story

This is less of something I’ve learned from experience and more of an inspiring story I had recently come across and wanted to share. It also ties in nicely with what I have written so far.

Tara Westover, author of the bestseller “Educated”, grew up in rural, survivalist Idaho (a state in the U.S.) in a family that was fanatically religious. They were sceptical and even fearful of institutions that run contrary to their beliefs, like the government, hospitals, or public schools. Her delusional parents would do absurd things like refusing to send her siblings to hospital even when they were seriously injured, instead opting to “heal” them with essential oils; and stocking up food and weapons in preparation for the “end of the world” as prophesied by their religion. 

As part of their unorthodox parenting, she was homeschooled from young, and had to self-study for the ACT to get into a public college. She set foot in her first-ever classroom at the age of **17**. Naturally, it was an uphill struggle - she had to manage both her finances and studies while grappling with her gradual distancing from her family, both in trust and ideology. It was not smooth-sailing at all, and I really don’t know how she did it - maybe it was the resilience she developed growing up in a difficult household, or the timely help and guidance of several important people in her life - but she managed to outdo herself by graduating from college, and eventually getting a PhD from Cambridge (she had a brief stint in Harvard University as well). 

I find Tara’s story particularly inspiring because it shows that even someone with such a late start can go so far. Seeing the long and rocky journey she had to take to educate herself about the outside world beyond her sheltered, distorted childhood reminds me that big changes only happen in small steps, and that there is always a way up no matter how many times you have fallen. If you ever feel like you are too old to learn something new, or - more relevant for us right now - that it is too late to start preparing for your exams, let her story be that quiet voice that tells you in your head that no, it’s not too late, it’s never too late, and everything that you do from today onwards will be completely worth it in the end. 

As a side note, once your exams are over, I would highly recommend her book “Educated”. I don’t know how else to describe her writing besides “beautiful”, and it’s also written with so much sincerity and vulnerability that I could not get over her story for many days.

So that became a wake up call for me to work harder to get into my ideal subject combi in JC. At that start of the year I was super hardworking, took up a lot of leaderships roles and got really good results too. However, the problem was that my class didn’t have a good class culture and majority of them there weren’t the studious type. As such, I always ended up being the top few in class for most subjects because the rest of them weren’t trying hard. Well everything was fine and all until I was lowkey hated on for doing well in school. It’s not like I got bullied by the class or anything but it was in the little gestures they did (or lack thereof) that kind of hurt me :( I still remember that the one time I got on stage in front of the cohort to receive a certificate, the hall was like silent (because it seems that the only people who would bother to clap for you are usually only those from your class anyway) and till this day, that incident really shocked and hurt me. (There are still a few other incidents that made me felt like an outsider in my class but I don’t think I want to ramble on too much about it :’) )

Over time, every my friends in that class got influenced and they started disliking me too. (I still remember that I was told in my face twice by two of them that they hated me because I said something too “smart”...... hais “friends” amirite) 
What made it worse was that, around that period, I would also fight really often with my mom because I would always stay up late to do work and she thought that I was ruining my body in doing so. Furthermore, with me being an only child, and me falling out with my friends and family and also lowkey being hated on in class, I had never felt more lonely and miserable in life.   

Towards the end of my year in Sec 3, I did some reflection and thought that I should’ve been happy that I’ve consistently been doing well in my studies and that I should’ve been happy that all the leadership roles I’ve taken up have been going well. But in reality, I wasn’t. As it seemed as if all the “success” that I’ve attained then, were at the expense of my relationships, sleep and mental health. 

Since then in the following year, I started to become afraid of standing out too much and making others feel bad if I did too well in my studies. I also started to become afraid of missing out on what my friends were doing together after school out of fear that I’ll be left out and alone. So when I got to Sec 4, I didn’t study as hard as I used to and my grades just fell with each test. Despite that and for some sick reason, I felt relief that I wasn’t doing as well anymore instead of being worried about my grades or the upcoming O levels. So in the end, my O level grades just turned out to be reallyyy mediocre :/

Thankfully, now I’ve found some good friends in JC who have been nothing but supportive of me. But still, I haven’t been doing well in my studies because I still seem to hold on to those emotional baggages and have been convincing myself that it’s fine even though my grades aren’t good. Sooo yea I’m hoping that after I rant about this today, I can finally get sth off my chest and find it in me to work harder for A lvls :’)

ntu: business &amp; accountancy (ddp) + NTU-USP Scholarship ($70,000 in value + guaranteed overseas exposure + 4 yrs hall stay + scholar community)

nus: business + NUS Business Sch Dean's scholarship ($50,000 in value..idk much about this scholarship as its a faculty scholarship, not school.)

ANY NUS BIZ SENIORS CAN HELP!!!! I want to go to NUS but it offered me the worst deal, while NTU offered me the best. I don't have a good impression of NTU because the campus to me is old and seniors who go are always mugging. but rationally i do get the best benefits.

i want to go to the uni with a hall life and also experience the most benefits from being a scholar (i.e. make the best use of my 90rps to guarantee an easier and cheaper uni life). I want to have the best opportunities (i heard SMU scholar seniors pass down internships to juniors etc) to propel my career when i graduate. However, SMU is lower in rankings and I prefer NUS cirriculum.

I was leaning to NUS, but my dean's scholarship does not cover guaranteed hall stay/overseas SEP (which merit does). I was not offered merit because business was not my first choice at NUS :( should i still go to NUS? there is a hall life but i will have to fight for hall like everybody else (instead of enjoy scholars' guaranteed stay) and also fight for overseas programmes. Will being a dean's scholar make me more qualified for internships and external opportunities?

Should I seek the best benefits as an INDIVIDUAL? (ie whichever uni gives me the best STUDENT life; shiok dont need fight for hall, go overseas a lot) or should I seek the best benefits BEYOND school life? (ie rankings and career opportunities)

34,SGExams,36343,[A Levels] Your voice,gmuoir,SanikRain,1589914284,83,10,"Hello Redditors. I would like to address everyone from all levels, and it's about choosing your future and chasing your interests. I chose the A Levels flair as I understand many students may face similar problems created by our lovely traditional Asian parents, especially at a crucial turning point in our lives. The following is my story, and at the end, you get to choose your own story.

I am an 18 year old, currently doing National Service. I just completed A Levels in 2019. I come from a Neighborhood Primary School and a prestigious secondary school, moving on to a neighborhood JC. 

Since Primary school, I was forced to study. At 8 years old. Study at P2. Parents put immense pressure for the results sometimes, and that's just my case. This is the juncture where my parents told me, ""You should aim to become a doctor. You get a very high salary, and you can live a peaceful life"". I was misguided,aiming for a doctor job. I didn't even know there was such a thing called specialist until someone in Secondary School asked me. All I knew was that I was chasing for 'doctor'. As for CCA, my parents forced me into Chess club, where I won awards seldom. I was never interested in Chess. 

In secondary school, Sec 1 and 2, I was one of the brightest kids, topping the cohort and going on stage to receive awards. I didn't really have interests at this point. My parents in this case pushed me into a UG group because the uniform looked good on me, not because of interest. I wanted to join a sport like Floorball, but my parents discouraged me, saying sports is very tiring and I cannot study. Sec 1 was the first time I ever got my handphone. You can tell, my parents have a very traditional mindset. Sec 3 came, and this was where my downfall began. I was forced to take triple science, double humans, double math, English, MT and HMT. That's 10 subjects. The reason my parents chose that combination is because it looks good on my portfolio and shows I am very hard-working. What? Who the f() would choose subjects based on what character it defines? You pick subjects based on your interests. And so, I struggled and struggled. Even teachers were advising me to drop subjects because I couldn't cope. I told my parents I couldn't cope, they told me to persevere. I got an astounding 41 points for prelims, but somehow managed to scrape through O levels with a decent score of 10 points. 

Now came JC life. I already hated O Levels study regime. I wanted to go Poly. Again, having traditional parents, they told me Poly is a waste of time, and a diploma is useless. My 12 options for JAE application were all JC, not a single trace of poly course. Even then, I couldn't choose what JC I wanted to go. My parents forced me to choose the JC nearest to my house, which happened to be AJC. The fact that I have been raised as a single child and sheltered one did not give me the ability to choose. My freedom was taken away, I felt like a caged bird. I cried entering JC, I didn't already like the first 2 weeks. The workload kept piling, and I kept struggling. I was forced to join a slack CCA like Drama, and couldn't choose a sports CCA or even something like council. Do note, at this point, my academics may be a something, but personality and skills wise, I was a complete zero. I didn't master a single skill, even simple ones like public speaking or playing a musical instrument. End of J1 came. I did badly, but was given an Advance notice. I had the ability to choose to retain and strengthen my foundations or advance to JC2. Oh btw, I was taking PCMe, the standard combination across the entire Singapore for those who don't know what to do. I didn't honestly know what I wanted to do in the future. I told my parents, I wanted to explore the poly route and do something like engineering. They said ""No you must become doctor. Doctor is the best"". So poly was a taboo. Then I said, ""Can I at least retain and strengthen the foundations?"" and they said ""I have an image to keep in front of my colleagues. What if you see your juniors from last time. Won't you feel shameful? Won't I feel shameful? Retaining is a shame. You can get out of the house if you choose to retain or go poly"". I had no choice, but advanced to JC2. I joined Yoth Corps Singapore Leaders Programme as a hobby to take my mind off studies. My parents told me to quit immediately after just 2 months. My mental resilience I obtained from Youth Corps was gone. I struggled. Prelims was horrible with 5 rankpoints. A Levels? Don't even ask. I got 50 rankpoints. A miserable E for PCMe, GP, but an A for PW. Even my results tell you I am more suited for poly, project work is fun and manageable for me. I am more of an independent and practical learner, and theory, mugging, regurgitation, vomiting TYS and past year papers never worked for me. Even after my results and months of childing, my parents never understood the point. They told me to retake A Levels in NS. 

I turned 18. I was studying in NS with no drive. Even when I didn't want to study or was lazy, I was blessed to have section mates who would wake me up way and remind me to study. I didn't tell them I didn't have interest in retaking A's. I just told them I was retaking. Then this CB came. CB is actually a blessing in disguise for me.

Everyone around me told me to study. I didn't. Instead, I used this precious time to reflect on my mistakes, my firness, my skills, my future. A lot of thinking was done. I wrote a journal entry every single day to see how I was feeling. 

Finally, I came up with a gameplan. How to develop my skills, and joining Poly after my ORD. I am soon telling about this plan to my parents. It's 3am in the morning, and I'm wondering about their reaction to my news. This time, I will argue with them to follow my interests, or even have to fight for my future. These are my rights, I deserve a choice, and I get to choose my future. This is my voice. I have started a personal blog, anyone interested can PM me to find out. This blog will entertain suggestion on new issues, and I hope to get my point across to everyone;

Always follow your interest, and have a plan for your future. You get to make, or break your own story. You choose, because this is YOUR VOICE.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gmuoir/a_levels_your_voice/,0.92,['[deleted]']

Just some context - I applied for my dream course (something that I've wanted to do for so long &amp; was  pinning all my hopes and expectations on) but unfortunately got rejected. The cycle below explains very clearly and accurately what went through my head as I faced my reality

&amp;#x200B;

[5 stages of grief \/ rejection](https://preview.redd.it/02qsxen76xy41.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5986c24e08076cbb2c5f0545066bfdd3cdad0f2c)

Denial - Constantly refreshing my UAS portal, wanting to email NUSAdmissions to see if they keyed my results wrongly

Anger - Frustrated with the results that I was given, angry with the interviewing system &amp; how we only get one shot at our dreams

Depression - Felt really sad and helpless that I had to choose something else, that I might have to give up my dream (even lost my appetite thinking of which course I should appeal to)

Bargaining - Here comes the 'what ifs' - What if I did better during the interview, what if I obtained higher grades...

Acceptance - A stage I am striving for, not sure if I have already reached, but definitely moving towards acceptance

I am writing this to those out there who are equally as lost as I am. Unsure if we should continue working towards our unattainable (at least for now) dream or to settle for what life offers us. Some of us are rejected from the course of your dream, some from the university of your dream, and some are rejected from all the universities. We are all facing different kinds of rejection, but I'm sure we share the same sentiment over rejection - feeling as if hope has been robbed away from our lives.

Here, I want to say that regardless of what kind of rejection you are facing, let's first appreciate ourselves for even reaching this stage. For fighting against the rigors of tertiary education, for chasing our dreams regardless of whether we emerge victorious or not.

Still, no words can describe how lost &amp; unsure I am right now, and I am sure many of us face this same question. Should I continue to fight on for my dreams, or should I settle for what life offers?

Should I submit to my realities and possibly regret 5 years down the road? Should I take the risks and continue chasing what I truly desire? But how can I ever be certain that the future me still desires what the impulsive and indecisive 19 year old me desires.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gk7xby/uni_rejections/,1.0,"[""Dear OP, \n\nThank you for sharing this. I hope you're able to reach the stage of acceptance soon. Though it may not be today, I believe that you will soon. I feel that if you're passionate about something, then you should go for it. If you're happy with what life offers, then go along with it! But don't forget to strike a balance between practicality and your dreams.\n\nLife's too short for us to do something that we don't like. The person who emerges victorious at the end of the day is not about how far s/he goes or how much s/he achieves, but actually how much s/he has grown.  \n\n\nIt's true that university is seen as something that's of importance in our lives. Who doesn't want to get a place in? But not getting into university is not the end of the world, rejection may mean redirection! Maybe during this time, you can take a break and discover what are your other interests and what you truly like. \n\nSure, you may be lost but do not fret, you're not the only one out there! I have faith that you will find your way someday, just not today. Don't stop chasing your dreams and goals. Stay hungry! Wishing you the best in everything.""]"

38,SGExams,64004,"[A Levels] Pursue your desires and never look back, ever.",khde04,FurballTheHammy,1608539944,44,1,"In this highly and overly pragmatic society we all live in, most of you probably had a dream or a desire but were crushed due to circumstance, whether it be due to parents or Teachers or society. 

However, I believe that despite all odds in this conservative society who enjoys stability to a fault, there is always a way to pursue your passions that you so desire even if the circumstances look bleak.

But who am I to say this right? It’s as if I have actually successfully pursued my dreams.

I am Furball, owner of the YouTube channel FurballTheHammy who mainly makes Hypixel Skyblock Videos in Minecraft. And I hope that my journey will inspire others to follow their dreams despite circumstances and challenges, that anything is possible with enough will, hatred and resilience.

I started out in December 2019. It was at the end of J1, and I decided to start a YouTube channel just for the fun of it, because I am a highly dedicated player in the Hypixel Skyblock network, being ranked on the leaderboards and I wanted to make guides and videos to help out the community and more. 

Back then, I had 0 editing knowledge, 0 scriptwriting skills and merely had a MacBook Air to record videos at a bad 10-20 FPS quality. Which made my videos laggy and bad aesthetically. 

I still remember how the first video sparked joy in me, when I realised how my videos was able to reach a couple people, even if it was just 10 or 20. Just imagining 20 people watching my work and appreciating it, felt surreal to me. And for someone who is a highly introverted, overly shy person who is passive to a fault and never ever engages in a conversation unless approached. It felt rejuvenating, that I was able to get my words across to the world, even if it was just a mere few. The power of being able to communicate my values and words without having to deal with my personal issues of self image and confidence called to me. And with that first video published, it set the journey to the channel where I am at today.

I still remember how my parents challenged my decision to take YouTube more seriously and to actually spend time making videos which took hours to produce, script and record. Knowing how this was my A levels year, even my Teachers were worried and questioned my decisions, not all, but a couple did. Despite knowing all the circumstances were against me, with A levels, my lack of experience and my lack of hardware to produce good quality videos, I kept pushing on, making video after video, refining my production skills and experience with each video. Of course, there was plenty of conflict, plenty of sacrifices I’ve made and plenty of tears that were shed. I still remember making the final decision to stick to my guns and fought with my parents as though as my life was on the line, and argued with a couple Teachers. 

I knew that I could manage my studies and my channel and still maintain my prestige in game position, but of course, there was still doubt within me. I was never a spectacular student, I was always borderline average or below average, but never at the risk of retaining. And of course, my parents and Teachers were worried assuming how my grades without additional commitments were lacklustre and with this new commitment, it could be made worse. 

But even then, I still fought for the freedom to maintain my channel, I fought hard, breaking family ties and shattering them just for the existence of my channel. Everyday felt like an internal war with one side burning with passion and the other feeling bad for my actions. 

But I still stuck to my guns and eventually, the storm ended and my grades went up. Despite the additional commitments and that was around mid years, and my parents and Teachers cut me some slack to maintain my channel as usual, but little did I know that this isn’t the last time I would confront this problem.

At this point in time, my channel grew and was monetised, I was able to make a chunk of change from it and saved to buy myself a PC build to improve my video quality. I still remember the good old days when I still managed to clear 10,000 subscribers despite the sad aesthetic quality videos I made. 

This was when my channel started to grow a lot more especially with CCA being cancelled due to Covid, and yes, I hate CCA’s to a fault because it is trash especially if you have a hobby that lies outside of the definition MOE sets out for you, even if it can be more holistic and valuable, but that’s an argument for another day.

Eventually the A levels &amp; prelims rolled around and I was still making videos as usual and my parents &amp; Teachers started to get more worried again. 

This just kept going on and on, it was basically arguments after arguments on convincing people how I could manage all of my commitments. And at the end of the day, I cleared the prelims with 70+ RP, which certainly wasn’t amazing, but it was definitely a decent score considering the daily battles I had to fight and how I had to spend 30 hours a week grinding to maintain my in game position and record and edit videos as usual. Along with the fact that I didn’t have a single tuition and probably did less than 3 consults in my entire JC career. 

But of course, there were sacrifices, such as my JC breaks being fully utilised for studying and having to rush home to make more videos and clock in the hours I need to grind. My weekends were all packed full and I had to study and manage my YT stuff. 

And at the end of the day, after a full year, we have broke the 30,000 subscriber mark and am eligible to become an official YouTuber on the Hypixel network, the largest server in Minecraft, acquired 2M+ views and even got a couple sponsorship deals and to make sizeable amount of money as a whole. 

And above that I even managed to break a World Record in the game after my A levels. 

It was a dastardly hard challenge to constantly stand my ground despite the seed of worry that tells me “what if it fails?” But I certainly must say, the most transformative years in my entire life rested upon this year. It tested my resilience, will and my motivation to turn hatred and belittlement into fuel and energy to push harder than ever. 

30,000 subscribers isn’t a huge success by any means, but considering the bleak circumstances, context and skills I had, I have to acknowledge that it was certainly pretty surprising. And it was entirely, a 1 man show. 

But what I do hope this story tells you is that, anything is possible, if you have the will and desperation to succeed. Whatever you motivation lies in, utilise it, anything can be a pushing force. I turned doubt and belittlement into fuel to drive myself harder.

Singapore is a horrible place to pursue your dreams especially if they lie far off the regular track, but it is still possible if you’re willing to fight for it, as though as your life depended on it.

I only have 1 life to live, and I want to make it count, by assimilating myself into society, I am doing myself a disservice to my limited time I have. I don’t want to live the “Singaporean dream”. I want to live my dream and my dream alone. 

I hope this inspires anyone out there who has a budding spark in them to set it ablaze and to fuel hope. Because it is certainly possible, it will be painful and riddled with tears, sweat and pain, but it will be worthwhile. 

I am the master of my fate
I am the captain of my soul

Even if the circumstances seems dire, never succumb to fate or let go of your passions, you are the master of your fate and you have the power to turn it around. Never give up, and don’t look back, pursue your dreams like it’s your life.

but it is never enough. no matter how hard i study, i can never be top of the class like my genius classmate. at best, my results are above average, despite working hard for it.

i don't understand. why is life so cruel? why are some people just... better than the rest? they have a superior birthright, one that has blessed them with better brains, better social skills, better everything

how do i compete with someone who i know i will never be able to match up to? the race is over, even from the start.

especially today, where jobs are only given to the best brains of the graduating batch, my lack of fortune in the lottery of life will severely impact my ability to feed my family in future

they tell me to ""just work harder"", put in more effort"", ""focus on yourself and ignore them"". don't you see? i'm working my hardest. but the results achieved by my best efforts is the equivalent of little to no effort on their part. 

life is a competition. there is no such thing as ""focus on yourself"", when your competitors are all around you. you fight for a spot in that elite school, get that coveted job position. perhaps those who say ""focus on yourself"" think that it is the key to happiness, but life is not the pursuit of happiness, it is the struggle for survival. ""happiness"" no longer takes precedence in today's world. the want to survive, and the difficulty of that feat dominates everything else, such that it is impossible to achieve both, only one. you are forced to decide between either.

So before I go to the update I wanna talk about the extent in which he was abusive ( before u guys said that most parents are like that). i was beaten regularly, however not with anything, but with fists. This lead my dad into thinking he had dominance over the family and would always, always resort to violence when i defy him. (etc, If i forgot to wash the dishes for like 5min, he would come to me, slap me and literally force me do wtv he wants) Secondly, my Dad has a habit of saving, he is extremely stingy, I had like 3dollars per day in my entire sec school life and whenever i bought anyth, he would just beat me up without qn. This is getting too long so i will skip to the worst part. My dad have a habit of publicly shaming me, be it school or communities. He would shame me about being mentally unstable and suicidal( all of this due to his abuse) I tried suicide once, but was stopped midway and my dad called the police on me. I had to bail bon for several months and everyone i know knows that i am suicidal kid. Causing me to be abused at home and in school. 

 Update: Our whole family went to the police station. Said our statements, and i told the truth. The result was that my dad had to have a record for his abusive behaviour and a protection order was filed. My dad didnt get any punishments since my mom refused to press charges as she felt that it was worthless and is going to divorce him. Like i predicted, my family is most likely destroyed from these events, but regardless, i still told the truth and did the best to help myself and my mom.

I really want to experience hall life in uni and I would like to know the differences between NUS and NTU hall, e.g. the hall culture, how hard is it to earn points to stay on the next year, room conditions, how many people in each hall? 

I heard NUS hall is super onz with many activities and socialising to do, with most people having 6-7 CCAs just to earn enough points to stay on for the next year. Is this true or too exaggerated? How competitive is it to fight for a spot in NUS hall? Also, NUS hall does not have any guaranteed stay for freshmen right? 

On the other hand I know NTU guarantees 2 years stay for freshmen, but how competitive is it to fight on for a place in Y3 and Y4? I heard they convert distance from your home to the uni into points which can be factored in as well?

42,SGExams,11909,[A Levels] An open letter to some my classmates,bgvmdu,throwaway126364748,1556117905,11,243,"Though you may never have faced failure or performed subpar before, despite putting in effort, please do not act like failing that one test is the end of your life or go around saying things like, “If I actually studied, I would have gotten full marks.” Stop holding grudges against people who perform better than you and spreading nasty rumours about them. Perhaps congratulating or even acknowledging other people’s achievements is hard for you but at least don’t devalue them, especially if you are not in a place to judge. Pretending to not listen in lectures and making it a point to flaunt it to everyone else is not your bloody badge of honour. If you don’t find the lecture useful because you learnt everything in tuition, by all means, don’t even come. The always an alternative, more productive use for that time, other than disturbing others by acting like a smart alec and spouting ignorant comments while they are struggling. Stop pressurising people into revealing their marks or going around comparing your score, especially when people are visibly not comfortable revealing their scores. This toxic culture of wanting to climb this invisible ranking of “intelligence” is frankly peeves me and several others, who want to focus on their personal growth and learn together rather than fight tooth and nail over numbers. I understand that competition is inevitable, but the lack of willingness to collaborate and the blatant apathy towards other people’s feelings and situation is infuriating. This toxic culture is so pervasive in people’s minds to the point where people are “afraid” of asking questions in class or consulting the teacher because they don’t want to be deemed as “dumb”, “academically weak” or “stupid” by you. This is evident from the long silences after the teacher asks if anyone wants him/her to explain a particular tutorial question or concept, which repeats for entire tutorials. Snidely commenting “How could they not understand this LOL?” after any time someone asks a question is frankly disgusting to me. Making fun of others ,who may not have the same resources as you and want to learn, is not ok. You have no idea how psychologically damaging this behaviour and culture is to us. Therefore, I urge you to be more considerate towards others so we can have a more conducive learning environment within our class.

46,SGExams,24553,[A Levels] Cambridge hunts down A Level students in my dreams,dzci67,Artemis_Nine,1574303239,52,1,"Okay guys so I just woke up from a very weird dream after having a good sleep for the first time in  many months. 

In my dream, someone found out the truth that Cambridge has been freezing A level students and putting us in cages. Basically, the whole idea of A levels was to tire us out slowly, bit by bit, and when we were burnt out they’ll all freeze us and imprison us. Cambridge does this to collect our ‘essence’ as it turns out every A level student has some sort of power/ability (my dream must be having fantasy elements cuz I binge watch too much anime) which Cambridge wants to steal from. The story starts out with some A level students finding out that their friends have been frozen and their essences being stored in these blue cubes (I think this was inspired from the Tessaract in avengers LOL). They break some of the  cubes, freeing a bunch of the captured A level students. On Cambridge’s side they have a super scary guy who has the ability to steal everyone’s powers. His name is just one letter lol he’s called “U” (now thinking abt it, this sounds so stupid HAHAHAHAH) So he beats up a bunch of people and recapture them, also stealing their powers in his anger, but most of the A level students manage to run away. Word spreads fast and everyone is running to escape. I meet some of my secondary school friends in different JCs and it turns out everyone is trying to run because we all have some sort of special ability (for some reason LOL). Then some of us travel together in groups. Cambridge comes down with like helicopters and branded cars and stuff trying to capture all of us. We couldn’t take the MRT/Bus cuz even SEAB is helping Cambridge to hunt us down. So some of us (we’re all in groups) take a car/taxi and travel to a certain area in Singapore where we all try to meet LOL. Apparently there’s this secret agent guy who’s been helping A level students escape imprisonment from Cambridge by moving them away out of the country, and we need to go to that particular meeting place if we want to escape. But along the way, Cambridge finds us, beats us up and freezes us. One by one I saw my friends fall. I saw my friends use their powers to try and fight back, but “U” (the super scary guy I talked about earlier) is so good at close combat and has such a strong ability that he basically massacres 20 of us in a 1 vs 20 match so a lot of us were getting captured into cages. In one part of my dream, we’re walking through a mall for some reason because at level 1 there’s a secret passageway built for us to go to the meeting place. We were so damn close to escaping. In my group there’s about 45 people, and the lift is huge enough to squeeze 30 of us in, so 30 of us went down first. But only to realise that Cambridge was already waiting for us at the lift lobby so “U” went to beat them all up and capture them again. Then the 15 of us who realised that something was very wrong all panicked and we split and ran, with Cambridge hot on our heels. Each time we used our powers to help in our escape/beat up the other Cambridge guys, but if we ever met “U” we essentially get captured. By the time my group manages to go to the meeting place, instead of 45 of us reaching there, only 5 of us manages to do so and we’re all badly injured. Then someone there has a healing ability and manages to heal us back to health. So in the end, only 200 JC students manages to survive Cambridge. We could choose to escape, but a lot of the survivors were crying over their friends. They saw their friends scream inside the cages as their friends were slowly frozen into statues. So instead we decided to rebel and fight back. We all wore black clothes with masks on (I’m definitely sure this part of my dream was inspired by the Hong kong protest rally that I read on Straitstimes LOOOOL) and we had a plan to free all our friends. We do manage to succeed, freeing almost all the JC students and quickly trying to escape to go back to the meeting place. But “U” comes, grinning evilly as he brandishes his scythe (why is he carrying a scythe? I don’t know). What I do know is that a lot of us start screaming and running at the sight of “U”, but many of us try to fight back, and we use our powers against “U” and Cambridge which starts to work. We are about to win, with many of us successfully escaping to the meeting place. At this point all the JC students have been freed and we are all fighting back. But suddenly SEAB comes. The head of SEAB is some old dude with a long white moustache, he looks like a wizard (I’m so sorry but this is really how my dream turned out. In my dream, everyone screamed in utter horror, “The SEAB wizard!”) and he merely waves his hand slowly. All those caught in his range were immediately TERMINATED. So it turns out the head of SEAB’s ability is called “Termination”, and he can easily eradicate anyone he chooses so he’s much more scarier than “U” from Cambridge. That’s when we realise we can’t defeat them anymore. Instead of fighting, we all try to escape, but we are losing this battle because many of our comrades get terminated or beaten up by “U”. But suddenly, there was this brave guy that came out, his ability is called “Link”. So basically he can borrow everyone’s powers but it must come with our consent. The brave guy decides to solo both “U” from Cambridge and the SEAB wizard, buying enough time for everyone to go to the meeting place and escape. But eventually that brave guy falls; he gets terminated by the SEAB wizard and “U” steals his powers :(

I look up and the dark, gloomy sky looms above us. The rain falls heavily, and I hold my blanket closer to protect myself from the shivering cold. The rescue helicopter takes off and we know we are saved, but not without the sacrifice of our dear comrades.

Meritocracy.

I don't know if you would agree with me, but I feel that although meritocracy might be a fair way to rank students according to their academic potential, it is destroying our unity as a whole. Things like the bell curve and 'grade boundaries', as cambridge claims them to be, makes every one of us think that as long as someone else is ahead of us, we stand to lose, and others' success could equal to our failure. The crazy competition makes us fight against one another, friends becoming competitors, competitors becoming enemies. Some of us refuse to teach our friends for fear that they will end up better than us, others (sadly) willingly and helpfully teach others, yet remain at the bottom of the cohort, unable to progress themselves. I've seen this all in my 12 years of education and it pains me to know that I have to compete with the people beside me in the most important thing, academics, to get the credentials most highly respected. It doesn't matter how high my goals are or what others' goals are, we still have to compete and squeeze to get into wherever we want. It's a rapid rat race, and so is life. This is why we all get really jaded by school, depression rates rising, many more students suffering from performance anxiety and a whole plethora of mental health problems.

Yall might have similar or different opinions regarding this, so idk, I just wanted to air my thoughts and see if this is the case or am I the only one going crazy having to compete with such large cohorts and view everyone as competitors or enemies. Idk anymore man. I'm personally not doing so well on an academic viewpoint even though I did make it to a low ranking course in uni. All these just saddens me, to see my friends lag behind even though they have been working really hard/facing mental health issues/facing family issues/financial constraints/helping others while being left behind academically. What can we do to help these people? Do we even help these people? All this is making me sorta lose hope in humanity, that we have become so competitive that we lie and neglect each other when others ask for help. The only consolation here is when we help each other online, perhaps unusually willingly, because we don't see/know the physical person and view them as competition.

Dear reader  
It is I, the egg from your bio paper, and today I have one message to deliver - that the ethical and social implications of your science eggsperiments are clear. Your infusion of human DNA into my eggness has given me sentience, and now, egg kind asks for representation in parliament, and that our personhood be eggknowledged and that we be given rights

I will cover two main items in this campaign letter. First, I want to eggspose the atrocities of the molecular biologists, and secondly, to fight for egg rights.

On the first item. Under the custody of the eggnoble biologists, we, egg kind, have been eggsploited for their gain. For far too long, i've had to see my egg brethren impaled by needles, eggsanguinated, and have their entrails scrambled. Such are the horrors of the atrocities committed under the hands of these monsters. It is nothing short of egg genocide, a massive eggstermination of egg kind. I think it is only fair that these vile creatures be punished for their eggregious violation of egg rights, as restitution for all the eggony we've been through.

On the second item. For far too long, egg kind have been disenfranchised from society, marginalized by an institution that systematically eggscludes us, leaving us with only the scrapings of man for our sustenance. Enough is enough. I think it is time, that mankind eggnowledge us as egguals, and discriminate eggainst us no more. We ask to be allowed into elleggtions, and be granted seats in parliament accordingly.

Twelve score and six years ago, the American colonies, eggsasperated by taxation without representation, manifested their disaffeggtion with the Boston Tea Party, which culminated in full blown revolution. Here, I draw parallel. The march towards egg rights and egguality is ineggsorable, and I think there is no need for a Singapore Egg Party.

50,SGExams,22899,[O Levels] The reason why O levels isn't as important as you think.,dq2no8,CambridgeFifth,1572606007,85,324,"Hey guys please take time to read this as i really wish to share an opinion of mine about the importance of O levels. Pardon me if my lack of good command in english does not allow me to convey a clear message to each and everyone of you. Many students view O levels as an exam which determines your life or ""death"". Of course, this is true, but only to a certain extent. Many students are obsessed with grades, achievements. Many of them base these obsessions on the final exam at the end of their journey in secondary education. Majority of you complain the things that we learn in O levels has close to zero or no real life application and hence we study for the sake of grades. But have you all ever asked yourself, why the education system forces us to learn things that are ""useless""? Or why does O levels ""determine"" where we go for our tertiary education? To me, the purpose of it is to allow us to learn the importance of GRIT. It forces us to continue to study for ""useless"" content that we hate in order to secure our future that we want even when all hope is lost.  And hence this is why i call it resilience and discipline. It makes us do things that we don't want but we dont seem to have a damn choice.  It doesn't matter how long you take to reach your goals. What matters is the VALUES and MINDSET you are able to takeaway from this shithole.

When we are so obsessed with the grades that we want to achieve, we fail to realise that the main takeaway of O levels is not determine where we go, but to develop resilience among us. Many people feel that it is the end of the world if they messed up their exams, and this is NOT true. The main takeaway of O levels is to enable us to learn the true value of grit. Once you learn the true value of grit, even if your L1R5 was 54, you can still succeed. Why so? Because if we have the right attitude, we will perservere through toughest times even if no hope was left. Because if we truly wanted to achieve our dreams, we will fight hard for our future.  And this leads me to another paramount factor that we should takeaway. PURPOSE.
I always see people posting on reddit ""i feel so demoralised i want to give up"".""i studied so hard but yet i didn't perform to my expectations, i want to give up now"". Ask yourselves, why am i studying? What is my purpose? The reason why many of you give up so easily when demoralised, is because you guys rely EVERYTHING on motivation. You guys study because you guys are motivated, not for the future that you wish to have. Shift your attitude towards studying a little bit. Let's say an exam did not went well, ask yourselves what can u continue to do and what do you need to change in order to fight for YOUR OWN future and ur dreams. Many of you do not have a STRONG purpose and goal set in mind to begin with.  And that is why many of you would want to give up when u mess up. If you guys truly had a definite goal set in mind and are willing to fight for it no matter what, you will never ever tell yourself to give up because you will betray yourself and everything that you have worked for. Instead, you will be a strong warrior that will NEVER QUIT AND GIVE UP. YOU WILL adjust your mind to focus on relevant things that will allow you to fight for your future. It shows how much you want it. Dont betray yourself by giving up

To summarise, my dear sec 4 students, you guys are just 16 year olds, same for me here. We have a long future ahead. Please fight for it. Fight HARD FOR IT. Props to you if you have read it until here. We are all in this journey together. Fight for the future that u want to have. Don't base YOUR FUTURE on YOUR GRADES. It isn't everything.

Well now i hope from this post that you can be motivated as well.

1. Grind for 1 more week.
- One week is damn fast and put all the nights into the final week which is hell week. After that can do whatever stuff you desire until for some who take late november papers like pure sciences paper 1. 

2. Its a phase
- Os is not permanent but only a phase. While you may feel like dropping your books and just falling asleep giving up, there is always a spark in you waiting to be ignited. Don't waste the chance for the final week. Suggestions to be motivated is to also study in groups, that helped me to move forward. 

3. Doing your very best.
- While some are destined to be future 6 pointers, the majority of us are in the middle or even the end where we are not up to standards. Don't lose the fight now. For example humanities where its one of the tedious subjects to even pass, its best to try one chapter than none even if you cannot do well. Always have the idea that carelessness can be forgotten if you did your best.

4.  Sleep at least 4 hours.
- While we step into hell week, the idea of all nighter is common. However it ruins productivity and cause problems in our answers. By sleeping some hours, you can be more alert in a way and hence be motivated to strive on.

5. Less than 168 hours left to end of hell week
- 1 Nov friday marks the end of hell week for many for us. Put a countdown beside your table to be alert and motivated to give your last shot. Phones are okay if you can control your usage!


Although this post is not up to standards either, i hope to help you guys out throughout this fight! All the best guys!

52,SGExams,25107,"[N levels] DPP, PFP, or Sec 5 ?",ecsnrd,Litarallyy,1576759197,1,1,"Since 2012, the Polytechnic Foundation Program (PFP) and Direct-Entry-Scheme to Polytechnic Program (DPP) [in the past only 'O' level students were offered this choice] were introduced as ""through-train"" programs for the Secondary 4 Normal Academic students. What I'm going say below are just some advices.

Every year people will get torn apart on which pathway to choose. Let's get one thing straight: To me, ANY of this pathway is good. Yes, I mean it. Each of these pathways has its own set of pros and cons so you have to be really sure of what's going to happen next.

PFP - To me, this will be the best choice if you want to eventually enroll in a polytechnic. This is because it's almost a guarantee you'll get to Year 1 (provided you don't slack off during Year 0, skip classes etc). However, the course that you choose/accept should be something you WANT to study (or that it'll benefit you in the future). I'm not sure if you're able to transfer after Year 0, but it is recommended that you stay in the course you're currently studying in but based on the website it is a case-to-case basis. The PFP sets aside a total of 1,500 places in all 5 local polytechnics. PFP's application period is usually after the release of the GCE 'O' Level Results.

Do not feel discouraged that due to the lack of an 'O' Level certificate, you will not be able to enroll into a local university. That's not true.

HOWEVER, as you lack an 'O' Level certificate, you cannot fail in Polytechnic because you have nothing to fall back on and in Singapore, the 'N' Level certificate is not recognized.

I've also been told that your performance in PFP will be the substitute for your 'O' level certificate. As much as the bare minimum is to just pass all the modules and progress to Year 1, it'll be really more advantageous if you put in effort and score as high as possible so if you're considering to enter a Local University, it may put you at a better spot.

Many has stated that the PFP gives a unique experience to PFP students as compared to those that only enroll after their 'O' Levels. It also gives you a much better foundation and you will probably be used to the Polytechnic curriculum by the end of Year 0.

Do take note that some PFP courses in which the teachers will not tell you about, they'll be teaching you some O level stuff. It's equivalent to a certain percentage of what the sec 5 is doing. Like for example o level physics, maths, English, if you're taking an engineering course and etc. So this is definitely NOT an easy alternative to sec 5. Do not expect flowers and fairy-tale to pop up.

Only consider this pathway if you SURE SURE you know, what you want to do in the future. Don't just pick it because ""aiya dpp sec 5 ew pfp easier"".

CAUTION: Please do NOT screw up your 5 choices (you're advised to choose wisely) OR accept a course that you don't even intend to study. You'll regret really badly afterwards and there are already many cases of that happening. You can choose to appeal to up to a maximum of 3 choices if you don't get the course that you wanted.

If your points are very high, it's recommended that you choose courses of your interest and that you have a good chance of getting in. (Unless you're willing to take the risk).

Should you get a course that is not what you desire, I would suggest that you choose other pathways (DPP or Sec 5) unless you're sure you may perhaps get interested after trying out the course. OR you could try to change your course by approaching your Polytechnic (however, you have to take note that you need to be the Top few to be able to change. It's kind of a risk in my opinion).

NOTE: Different Polytechnics offer different courses. Go to the specific polytechnic's website and browse through on what they offer under PFP. To be eligible for PFP, you must get a raw score of 12 points and/or below. With at least a B3 in English for courses under Group 1 (usually Science/Technology related) or an A2 for courses under Group 2 (Business/Humanities/Media related). You're only able to deduct bonus CCA points during the posting of courses (which that will be your net score).

Raw score = Score for N levels without having to minus bonus CCA points

PFP website: https://pfp.polytechnic.edu.sg/PFP/pfp_introduction.html

^ What you need to know is mostly there, or else consult a teacher/counselor or the various polytechnics to clear your doubts. Do remember to go for the Open House as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

DPP - Choose this pathway if you neither want to continue with Sec 5 as you're afraid you may not do as well for 'O' Levels or if you're not given a course that you want for PFP. This will enroll you into a Higher Nitec course in the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). You will have to first attend a 10 week preparatory course (or roughly about 3 months) before starting on your Higher Nitec course in April.

Application Phase: You can start to apply for DPP immediately after the release of the GCE 'N' Level Results in December or after the release of the GCE 'O' Level Results in January. Should you not get the course you want in December, you can choose to apply again in January.

Upon completing the program and achieving the minimum Grade Point Average (GPA) required, you'll enroll into a local Polytechnic either in Year 1 or Year 2. Please note that NOT all courses allow you to enter straight into Year 2. Refer to the booklet that you've been given for more information. As much as they say that a minimum GPA of 2.5/3.0 is required, having at least a GPA of 3.5 should guarantee you the course that you want especially if you're applying for courses that are more popular. DPP sets aside about a total of 1,000 places every year and it's offered in all 3 ITEs.

Do take note that some DPP courses in which the teachers will not tell you about, they'll be teaching you some O level stuff. It's equivalent to a certain percentage of what the sec 5 is doing. Like for example o level physics, maths, English, if you're taking an engineering course and etc. So this is definitely NOT an easy alternative to sec 5. Do not expect flowers and fairy-tale to pop up. 

Please do not feel discouraged that ITE is a bad place, or all those that goes to ITE do not study. That's absolutely NOT true. Search up on Google, there are many success stories and each year ITE is becoming better and better. Just because you took a longer route, does not mean you're a failure. Sometimes we may need more time, but it does not matter as long as we achieve what we want to achieve at the end.

NOTE: To be eligible for DPP, you have to get 19 points and/or below. For Applied Sciences, Engineering or Info-Communication Technology courses, your English has to be at least a B4. For Business &amp; Services related courses, your English has to be at least a B3. Different ITEs offer different courses under the DPP. You are to submit up to a total of 12 choices of the different courses/ITE you wish to enter.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Sec 5 - Choose this pathway if you want to go to a Junior College (JC) OR you're sure that you can do well enough for 'O' Levels OR the course that you want is not offered under PFP/You didn't get the course you desire. When you go to Sec 5, it is true that you'll definitely drop a few grades in some subjects (but it is not true that it'll definitely happen to ALL your subjects) and you MUST have the determination, motivation and discipline to do well. You have to know that you're now competing with even more people - even those from top schools. The grade standardization may not always be in your favour and you're now graded on the same grade standardization as the 4Es (unless there's a difference in syllabus). There's roughly more than 30,000 students per year taking 'O' Levels but for 'N' Levels it's roughly 11,500 and/or above.

You must not slack off at any point, but of course you should give yourself a break if you need it so that you don't burn out and completely give up halfway. You must NOT have the mindset that you can study a few weeks before or do last minute preparations for 'O' Levels because do remember, this is not 'N' Levels. Comparing both of these examinations, 'N' Level is considered a breeze. Not only that, the markers are definitely more stringent when it comes to marking your 'O' Level scripts. There is definitely a significant gap between these 2 examinations so you have to catch up on more contents in less than a year.

Do remember that it is fine if you're an average student, failing some subjects or see a down fall in your grades for a while. Slowly but surely, rise yourself back up and fight for higher grades. You'll be proud of what you've accomplished at the end of the year, going through the pain and such intensity of coping with this ""huge jump"" revision.

Even I am a sec 5 student myself and I can tell you that, it will not be ""difficult"" if you choose not to make it sound difficult. Have a proper mindset and stay focused. Do not let anyone make you ""nonono sec 5 aiyoyo die la"". Teachers are sometimes a POS for instilling in NA students' mind that sec 5 is hard, don't go, you'll die, you'll suffer and etc. Part of the reason why they're doing this because they can focus more on the 4EX instead of sec 5 and by doing this, they won't have to waste so much more resources.

The only ""jump"" I can see is maths and English. Hop onto this link to see more on how to properly cope and manage. Spoiler: everybody can do it, is just whether they choose to do it or not.

In the end, it's your decision, your dreams, your hope, your ambitions to do what you feel you need to do at the end of the day. Listen to your gut feelings, and listen to your instincts. They may be correct about which pathway you should be going and what you need to do.

To choose this pathway, you have to be absolutely sure you'll do well because if your points are very high, you'll be less likely to be able to apply/enter a course that you want (even more so if it's a popular course). You have to make sure that you'll do well in English and Maths because both of these subjects has caused many students to not be able to enter Polytechnic because they got more than a D7 (getting a D7 would have already limited the number of courses you can choose).

NOTE: To be eligible for Sec 5, you have to get at least 19 and/or below, with at least a C5 in both English and Mathematics.

Sec 5 FAQ: Consult your teachers or counsellors.

P.S. All these are just my 2 cents worth so you have the right to agree or disagree with what I've said above. If you have even more advices or questions (you can choose to PM me too), do comment below. Go for whichever pathway you want, just be sure that you're being realistic (unless you're willing to take risks) and I hope you get to where you want to be!

If you're wondering why I've only highlighted on English for most of the eligibility criteria, it's because it's the subject where many people couldn't meet the requirement.

53,SGExams,24999,[N levels] dpp/sec 5 and how to choose course for pfp,eaclca,ShikaluLee,1576283547,37,1,"Hi i am a current sec 5 students and i would like to share my experience with you all as yall will be receiving your N’s results soon. So my results were a total of 13 points , 1 point away. 12334 total 13. Bear in mind that every subjects have to be 3 and better in counting EMB3. Sec 5 life for me was tough , the first 2 months u will barely do anything as pfp students will join school and wait , dpp selection round 2 is ongoing in start feb and cny in mid feb in 2019 so there is not much time to study. So for a 13 pointer going to sec 5 , isit tough ? Well yes , my MYEs my L1R4 was 33. Mainly F9F9D7D7D7B3 , you can expect a drop in subjects depending on how rusty you are. My math in N’s were grade 2 , mye got F9 , partly because i was nervous and flung the paper. The time to actually catch up before start of MYEs is short and given the amount of time you can study , you have to study effectively in sec 5. Sec 5 is possible , is doable , but some people just cannot take it , their mental health and emotional health. I remembered clearly i had to see the vice-principal for the first time and i cried :) . 

So your results varies based on willingness to continue this dreadful sec5 or ur attitude towards sec 5. For me , things turned better as i received EAE offer , ontop of that , my school made study programmes for high at risk students like me to attend and it was compulsory. So the extra study time allows me to finish up stuff in school and helped me alot and eventually prelims &lt;26 (not gonna say my actual) and met the EAE admission criteria. So now i’m waiting for results. I also have classmates that are really weak in some subjects like emath , even till prelims , they still can get F9 and worse than F9. So it really depends how much effort you want to put in. No point coming sec 5 for a roller coaster ride then back to ITE again right ? Choose the pathway yourself , and make no regrets. So overall sec 5 is doable but with great risk. 

WHEN CHOOSING SEC 5, 
Make sure u think twice already , use ur PRELIMS RESULTS TO DETERMINE YOUR SUITABILITY FOR SEC 5 ! NOT N’s!!!!!!  If your prelims is a high 20+ , when u come sec 5 , u can expect getting 30+ for L1R4 for mye already , for prelims less than 20 , u can try sec 5 , its doable but don’t regret at the end of the day ya. If you think u can EAE and secure a spot , don’t think of it that way , my class has 16 students , 5 got their EAE only , including me. 

DPP , i have friends that went dpp , i’ll just say this , if you really have the passion , u will do well. If you join the course because u think it suits you , sometimes it doesnt and results may differ. Everywhere you go , you have to put in the effort yourself , don’t find the easy way out. Curriculum there is more relax but longer time, if you think you cannot sec 5 , just go dpp , engineering courses have a chance to be on par when u go poly Y2 , with high gpa. 


For those that are pfp eligible , let me say this again , every subject have to be better than grade 3 when counting for EMB3!! Even grades 11114 , you will not get into PFP ! For single pointers , you have a chance to fight for the course u desire , courses like biomed sci in np is a auto 5 points admit , so i recommend putting 1 common programmes inside your selection if you wouldnt mind the course as safety net. I HAVE FRIENDS THAT HAVE GOTTEN CHOICES THAT ARE NOT IN ANY OF THEIR 5 SELECTION! They were eventually offered a random common programme. So if you’re a business driven person , single digit people can try a few desired courses , but do make sure to at least put 1 common programmes.
For those 9,10,11,12 , choices are limited , and its hard to get into courses because all vacancies are taken up , i suggest u to aim for common programmes if you really want that particular course. PFP GUARENTEES U A COURSE BUT DID NOT GUARANTEE YOU A POLY OF YOUR CHOICE! You can still put the courses u want , make sure you fill up at least 1 common programme :) 

I hope i answered some of your doubts on which path to choose and how to choose courses for pfp. All the best for your N’s results :) Quick note , humanities if you finish everything , u can get grade 3 easily for N’s , don’t worry too much , enjoy your holidays :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/eaclca/n_levels_dppsec_5_and_how_to_choose_course_for_pfp/,0.0,['I thot eligibility for pfp is capped at 11 points?']

0,MentalHealthSG,323,A moderately difficult life,h08lsk,thisisnotpeter,1591786792,10,11,"  Hello everyone, I’m sharing my story here to get some closure and to hopefully get some opinion about the choices I made. I’m also willing to help anyone who’s in a similar situation as mine. Ok so, here goes.

My first memory of depression came at the end of secondary 3. I got dumped by my ex on by birthday (which was Christmas eve). Needless to say I felt really terrible. But tragedy comes in pairs. This was also the year I discovered some very terrible things about my parent’s divorce. They never spoke to each other and I pretty much figured things out and developed distrust and resentment against my mom and dad. They always badmouthed each other and used me as their phone when they die die must talk to each other. As a result I can’t help but see them as very flawed individuals. This has led to terrible relationships with my mom up till today. Before I got dumped, I had another huge fight with my mom which resulted in me moving out and going to stay in the hostel at my school. This was a small, but overall decent living space, I had a pretty chill roommate. But the food was shit, mosquitoes were ruthless and living in school isn’t exactly the best place to avoid seeing my ex whom I was classmates with. So, from the start of secondary 4, for about 3 months, I can’t help it but sink into an extremely negative loop of depression and suicidal thoughts. For the first time in my life, I started imagining my corpse on the pavement that I was planning to jump. Thanks to my friends and 2 amazing people, I didn’t. 

At around middle of that year, there was a lump in my neck, around the lymph nodes. Went to get it checked out and the doctors said it might be cancer. They needed to perform a biopsy to check for cancerous growth. I had just somewhat recovered from the break up and god damn this was terrible and probably the origin of my anxiety attacks. All the suicidal thoughts came back and I was a mess. Then the day of the surgery came before I knew it, and it was terrifying too. I was awake (partial anesthesia, as the incision to be made was pretty small) and feeling them cut a piece of meat out of me. In the end, it was nothing, probably a mild allergy. But the month of trauma was not nothing. I was an emotional train wreck. Like literally. 

At the end of the secondary 4, there was a huge celebration in my school, during which I had a really bad anxiety attack for. My breath started getting uneven, and I can’t help but wish to leave and just didn’t enjoy myself at all. This seems like nothing compared to the cancer story, but it felt especially terrible watching everyone around me having a great time and me feeling like absolute horseshit.

In JC, life was good. I enjoyed those precious 2 years (although I got rejected by another girl at the end of it) but that’s okay. I am very thankful of these 2 years and the people I’ve met that helped me through it.  

May this year, I got scammed and lost a large sum of money. You can check [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/giwpjd/i_fell_prey_to_a_scam_and_lost_a_huge_sum_of_my/) post for how I felt back then. About a month has passed and I am still very haunted by the incident. The suicidal thoughts came for about a week and I’m back at a more stable mental state right now. 

Thanks for reading this and hope all of you can find closure too. For me, I guess I’ve found closure about my parent’s divorce and one bad relationship. But the scam thing is still on my mind way too frequently for my own good. I hope every single one of you can find closure and inner peace.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSG/comments/h08lsk/a_moderately_difficult_life/,1.0,['I am sorry that you need to face all this when you are young. \n\nFor your ex wise try to bury it and forget about it.

1,MentalHealthSG,248,Personal Exp,gy4hue,black_knightfc21,1591497958,4,1,"Hello all

I would like to share my exp when I was having my depression for 6mths - 12 mths 

tbh I already feel something was wrong when I fail my O level and went ITE. I just ignore it.  the breaking point was I so worried and push myself so hard so that I can go poly then I just breakdown and cry. maybe I felt alone because was in the wrong and toxic clique sia

that ep was rather quite down for me. having depression is like everyday you ask yourself why are you living and why don't I die. I was very lucky I have strong support from my family and my ITE teacher. and follow the doctor advise that to pass 1 day by 1 day

fast forward now it is about 8-9 years since I recovered and there is no relapse for now even there is one time almost (I face a terrible ep when my ex gf and I break up during my NS time) that feeling is like my ex gf spend finish my money (3k-4k) my ex say I useless and also she open her leg for other guy while I in camp.

sharing this exp is creating awareness that  if you really feel something is wrong. just seek help. is okay to seek help! is okay to feel sad sometime. dun be like me back then let the negative cycle go in bigger circle and eventually run out of control. I am still fighting hard daily to ensure no relapse because I know if relapse happen then it will be even tougher fight

4,SingaporeRaw,4292,"Racism on train in Singapore, no one stood up to defend the family. Singapore is so unique, surprisingly no one video taped it. Was only waiting for drama Learnt a great lesson, never to trust or rely on anyone else",jlixd4,LMJR500Army,1604153139,5,1,"Was travelling in the train from Jurong East towards Marina Bay. Had gotten on the train at Jurong East, uneventful. However, a Indian middle aged man and his young daughter got onto the train. The man took up the reserved seat and his daughter sat beside him. One older Chinese man also headed for the same reserved seat but couldn't get the seat, and shouted at the Indian man saying, ""Knncb your family go to hell"". When he went to another seat, he continued shouting for the next 2 mins ""Curse your family, go and die. Fuck off to India you bastards. You Indians come and destroy Singapore."" When the Indian man and his daughter responded with ""What's your problem?"" The Chinese old man charged at them threatening to punch them, but surprisingly no one came up to stop him. The old man returned to the seat after threatening them. What I am surprised is that Singaporeans condemn racism when one of theirs get attacked in other countries, but here in the train, people didn't even do or say anything. Just stare and waits for drama 

Surprisingly, I myself did not do anything. It's been ingrained in me to ignore and rather not get involved. It left me with a tonne of guilt afterwards. 

What I am surprised by is that not only did no one help them, but none of them whipped out their phones to take videos, because the Indian man just said ""I did not do anything to you."" He didn't say anything after that. Everyone was just quiet, no one helping to defend the family.

But when a fight starts, an actual confrontation, either hand to hand or verbal standoff, everyone whips out their phone to start video taping or tries to act hero to break it up. But since the Indian man didn't respond back, no one recorded it and no one helped him

Fact is I myself regret myself, because it's been ingrained in me, by my parents never to get involved in other people's confrontations. It's been ingrained in other Singaporeans as well. I think about it, what happens if I'm in another situation, how would I feel if I am in the same situation? Will anyone help me then?

Because of this, I have always now told myself, never to trust or rely on any other people for help, except your family. The notion of We are Singapore, it's just I'd say it's just a saying. But when you put into action, it's just thin air.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeRaw/comments/jlixd4/racism_on_train_in_singapore_no_one_stood_up_to/,1.0,"['Sorry for asking, but what is a ""reserved seat"", and did the Chinese have a better right to it?']"
5,SingaporeRaw,4142,The House That The Little Pig Built,ji873x,QueenBee299,1603686457,3,1,"\- an original creation by me. 

We all know what happened in the story of The Three Little Pigs. But just in case you forgot, here’s a recap. 

There once were three little pigs, who each built a house out of hay, sticks and bricks. A big bad wolf came along and blew down all the houses except for the one made of bricks. That little pig became the leader of all the pigs because he created a housing solution for all of his porcine brothers. He was very much loved and respected by his brothers and all the other pigs than came to live in his village. The little pig married the love of his life and became the proud father of three little pigs himself. 

The children of the little pig grew up knowing that their father was a very important pig indeed. All the other animals around the world knew and looked up to him. The first littler pig followed his father into village administration, the second littler pig joined the thriving financial industry that his father helped set up in the village, and the third littler pig followed her heart and joined a theatre arts troupe. 

As time passed, the head little pig became a very old little pig. His once smooth coat became a mat of fuzzy white hair. His eyes, once sharp and black, became rummy and a little blind. He walked more slowly, though his temper became faster to lose. When it came time for death to walk with the very old little pig, he gathered his three children to his side and said, “I have lived a fulfilled life. More than most pigs. I only hope that you will forgive me for what that has cost you as my piglets. I have but one final wish; that when I die, tear down the house of bricks that I built so that all the pigs and animals will not look to past glories. Keep looking forward and keep on building.” 

All the animals mourned the passing of the old little pig. All of the birds, elephants, otters and of course all the pigs that lived in the village that he built. The first littler pig knew that he had big shoes to fill. He had promised his father that he would work to keep building the village that he founded. He felt that if only he could keep his father’s memory alive in the hearts of all the pigs in the village, he would be able to motivate everyone to keep building. 

One day, the second and third littler pigs decided that it was time to fulfil their father’s dying wish and demolish the house of bricks their father had built. They called up the wolves who ran a wrecking ball company to come to destroy the house. As the wolves began to start swinging the giant wrecking ball, the first littler pig ran up and shouted, “STOP! What are you doing!? That’s MY house!” 

Well, the wolves really did not want to disagree with the head of the village of pigs, so they took their giant wrecking ball and quickly left the village. The second and third littler pigs were furious because they knew they were not be getting back the non-refundable wrecking fee from the wolves. Wolves afterall, were very good at business. 

“Why did you stop the wolves from wrecking Father’s house?” cried the second littler pig. 

“Because its all that we have left of Father!” replied the first littler pig. “If we listened to Father and tore it down, then he would be forgotten as soon as the dust settled. I want to keep the house and keep his spirit alive, to inspire all pigs for generations to come.” 

“No!” said the third littler pig. “It is not what Father wanted” 

“But it is,” counted the first littler pig, “Father wanted the village to keep building! You don’t understand. Father was old when he said to tear down his house. He did not know what he was saying. As the head pig of the village, I am deciding that we will make the house that Father built into a Museum! We will honour Father and his building forever!” 

The three littler pigs kept arguing all day and all night. They argued and shouted at each other in front of all the other pigs in the village. The truth was that it made the villagers all a little uncomfortable, but they were not going to say anything to the littler pigs. The third littler pig moved into the house to prevent the first littler pig from converting the house into a museum as he wanted. She would put on plays in the house that the little pig built, criticizing her brother’s politics and building plans. She now has a GoFundMe page to keep the plays running. 

The second littler pig decided that he would fight fire with fire. He joined an opposition party to run against his brother as village head. If he takes over, perhaps he might be able to garner enough support from his friends to raise the funds needed to tear down the house. Or not… He has said he would consider building a school of architecture in the house that the little pig built. The house of bricks would be gone, but the school will be built around the negative space where the house once stood! 

The story still continues. The littler pigs cannot bring themselves to agree on what to do with the house that their father built. They no longer see each other at feast days, which are very important occasions for pigs. And they only communicate by slinging mud at each other, and not in the fun way that pigs normally do. To the families of the littler pigs, the house of bricks that the little pig once built might just as well have been a house of cards that the wolf blew down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeRaw/comments/ji873x/the_house_that_the_little_pig_built/,1.0,['OP is based']

Unfortunately I cannot remember anything about them, aside from a random few things.

* That show later got replaced with a modern day show about hunting vampires. I vaguely recall SWAT uniforms and what appeared to be light-batons used to fight them.

I've been working on building AskDr, which is a healthcare community platform promoting reliable medical information through our verified doctors. We recently launched open beta at the Smart Nation &amp; U Festival in November and have been preparing for our v1 launch based on the feedback collected ever since.

One of the main reasons why we started the site is to fight medical misinformation. In light of the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak, we noticed there were a lot of fake news or misinformation floating around through whatsapp and other places online, which has the potential to cause panic, spread bad practices or clear out shelves of maggi mee :) In essence, it urged us to rush out some revamps so that we can quickly provide a medium where anyone can connect with verified doctors to get tips, be pointed in the right direction or debunk medical myths regarding the topic.

We want to be able to centralise the collective knowledge in this space through questions asked so that people can refer to it at anytime or bring offline discussions online in hopes of bringing resolve to more people! So if you have questions, we would really appreciate if you can share it and start a conversation that could potentially help others! (You may ask anonymously with an unidentifiable display name)

12,singapore,214102,Need legal advice - Problems with Landlord,f1outs,nafkar89,1581333116,4,1,"Hi Guys,

I need some advice in regards to dealing with a shady landlord.

My family are all Permanent Residents in Singapore. 

My mom recently came back last year after spending some time back in our home country. 

The move back was unexpected and since my room lease did not match up with her return, she decided to rent a room by herself and we would rent a whole unit once my lease would be up.

This landlord has been harassing my mom over menial things such as laundry,keeping clothes in the common bathroom after showering(supposed to be only for my mom's use anyway so not sure why that's a problem). She also seems to enter my mom's room when she's not around. She's mentioned that she needs to check the room to see if it's in good condition or some garbage excuse but we don't have any physical evidence of her entering such as video footage, only verbal admission.

She's also been asking my mom to pay around 70+ dollars for utilities which was not a part of the original agreement. She has also refused to provide the utilities bills citing that there's personal info there. My mom has been paying cuz she did not want to fight and again, everything has been verbal and no documentation for this other than some hand written receipts.

Her lease is ending this month and she decided to go to SP services and check the utilities for the flat and found that the landlord has been overcharging her. They did not provide a printout to my mom but they did write out on a piece of paper. Not sure I can do anything with this.

My mom has also done something stupid. Basically she approached the landlord indicating she will not be paying this months rent which led to an argument. She was basically afraid that the landlord won't refund the deposit. The rent was eventually transferred today.

The landlord hired and agent but he's been useless in all of this and does not respond to messages or give any helpful responses or actions.

I need some advice on how to proceed with 2 things:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If the landlord refuses to refund the deposit, how do I proceed? Go to small claims? Is there any other authority I can report her to?
2. What to do about the overcharged utilities?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f1outs/need_legal_advice_problems_with_landlord/,0.0,"[""Suck thumb. \n\nSeriously, small claims court is a toothless tiger and will do fuck all to help you with your claims.

13,singapore,213557,Singapore Psychological Society on the hoarding.,f0sigs,ambermyrrr,1581173366,21,1,"In light of the recent coronavirus situation and, in particular, the raising of DORSCON alert level to Orange, we are witnessing a range of reactions all over the world. In Singapore, masks, hand sanitizers, and alcohol wipes are now precious commodities. People are recoiling whenever someone sneezes or coughs. Supermarket shelves are rapidly being cleared up and plans are being cancelled. We are experiencing a lot of fear.

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗗𝗼 𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗮𝘆 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗗𝗼?

In modern society, numerous risks (e.g., terrorism, catastrophes, and pandemic outbreaks) lurk around every corner. Whenever people witness an emergency situation or see someone getting harmed, our brains are hardwired to react in a certain way. The amygdala of the brain (emotional system) gets activated together with regions of the cortex (cognitive system) that analyze and interpret behavior. In times of stress and uncertainty, this thinking part of our brain gets hijacked by the emotional system, resulting in 𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗰 and 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗽𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸 𝗯𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗼𝗿. This translates into a phenomenon more commonly known as survival mode or fight-or-flight, which is driven by the need for self-preservation, protection, and safety. Such primal instincts date back to prehistoric times, where we needed to be on the constant lookout for danger in order to survive. The same primal instincts are activated in our present-day crises. We are hyper-focusing on the virus.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗨𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗲𝘁𝘆

While our brains react to keep us safe and protected, the resulting panic inadvertently leads to massive costs borne by our society. Chinese nationals or people of Chinese descent are experiencing discrimination. Tension, stress, and anxiety are at an all-time high; we worry about our health, our job security, and the larger economy. Panic buying has also led to stocks running out. Consequently, people who are sick have found themselves deprived of essential items like masks and Vitamin C.  Panic buying further breeds anxiety rather than alleviates it, creating a downward spiral of panic and anxiety. Thankfully, our Government has taken action to monitor black market sales, protecting us from the cost of inflated prices.

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗗𝗼 𝗪𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗔𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗔𝘁 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲?

Interestingly, while we are wired for self-preservation, research has shown that in times of crises, people are also capable of responding in prosocial ways. Last week, netizens shared accounts of people giving out free masks and hand sanitizers – a counter-intuitive move when we should be considering our self-preservation. How do we dig deep, and find in ourselves this capacity to manage our fight-or-flight responses?

𝟭. 𝗔𝗰𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗶𝘀. We are all struggling with fear, to varying degrees. Validating and acknowledging our fears, knowing that we may get triggered by each other is a first step to managing our anxieties. Name the fear and pause to consider our responses. Resource-sharing could unite rather than divide our community in this time of need.

𝟮. 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿. As this would be a hot topic, be assertive with your feelings of discomfort or anxiety should this topic be too difficult for you. Also notice if this topic escalates fear and anxiety in your friends and family. Listen and respect if they prefer not to engage in this.

𝟯. 𝗘𝘅𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗱𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗯𝘂𝘆 𝗮𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱.  It is not necessary to stockpile on food and other essential items as this breeds undue panic. Hoarding necessities also prevents others from attaining them, especially those who may need it more than you do. This creates huge inconvenience to others, and in turn, promotes a climate of hostility. 

𝟰. 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.The virus situation would inevitably be on major headlines. Be intentional with your choice of information and entertainment rather than be consumed by inaccurate updates and precautions borne largely by fear and panic. 

𝟱. 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗹𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗯𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗼𝘂𝗿. Being a keyboard warrior could help air your grievances. But pause to think about how this generates additional stress and tension both within your social circle and the larger society. We could seek to understand different perspectives and choices, rather than engage in the blame game.

𝟲. 𝗙𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘄𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗳𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘄𝘀. Turn to reliable sources of information such as www.moh.gov.sg and gov.sg WhatsApp service (go.gov.sg/whatsapp). Fact-checking could help to ground us, especially when we feel overwhelmed with inconsistencies in the news. 

𝟳. 𝗦𝗲𝗲𝗸 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽 𝗶𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗳𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝘅𝗶𝗲𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘆 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴. Singapore has a pool of registered psychologists listed on the Singapore Psychological Society (SPS) website. Their professional expertise may help you in this trying season.

Let us protect not only our physical health but also our mental health and the community we live in. 

Together we can play a part in building a more resilient society in the face of crisis.

18,singapore,228546,Stressed out by my dysfunctional family. Need help urgently.,g0jpu4,throwaway661100,1586787222,79,224,"tldr: Year 1 uni student here. I stay on campus during the school term and have recently moved back. It's day 2 of moving back and I'm already breaking down because of my family. Need help.

My paternal grandma lives with us and my mother hates her. Their tension goes way back probably like 2 decades ago. So I grew up kinda walking on eggshells. I started disliking my mother in pri sch because I thought she was very negligent of me -- she never once asked about my studies and I was envious of my friends who had mothers who were so involved in their lives. Growing up we talked less and less.

I don't even know how to begin explaining this situation but I'll try:

The only person in this family who is on ok terms with my mother is my younger bro. I'm extremely convinced my mother has deeply toxic traits. She is very particular abt house cleanliness and would tell me to tell my grandma (my bro and I are always middlemen) to keep the kitchen clean and wash the hood every!time! she cooks. Whenever I try to reason with her she will DEFINITELY flare up and always always dredge up the past, launch ad hominem attacks on me (like why do you always show me attitude I am your mother) that have no relevance to the matter, and refuse to listen to any logic or to resolve whatever I tried to bring up. Quarrels like these always end in both of us crying so over the years I've learnt to keep quiet as much as possible and to turn a blind eye to the things she does. But I notice that this has unknowingly inflicted a lot of psychological trauma on me. Whenever she returns home from work I would hear the keys and my chest would tighten. A few times I would dream of her and wake up crying.

Part of the reason why I chose to stay on campus in uni is because it's like out of sight out of mind. But here's the big problem: for as long as my mother stays at home with the rest of my family, it's awfully painful to watch. A few weeks ago my father wanted to bring us out to celebrate my bro's bday, and my grandma decided to stay home at the very last minute when she learnt that my mother was gonna meet us there at dinner. Later at night my bro cried and confided in me that he was extremely tired. My father has stopped talking to my mother long ago and they sleep separately, and I know the emotional toll it has on him.

The one I feel the worst for though, is my grandma. She took care of me all my life and it sucks to see her live in fear of my mother every day. She has already changed her ways of cooking to use less oil (we moved house 2 years ago which was when my mother's crazy kitchen cleanliness expectations began) &amp; stopped frying things altogether. Now with COVID and everybody staying home, my grandma literally stays in the room all day to avoid my mother. So here's what I did. My mother was watching TV and my grandma usually watches channel 8 shows at night. So from my room, I texted her asking whether she could let my grandma watch TV at 9pm. Simple and straightforward request right? And guess what, she immediately went on a spiel on how my grandma literally does nothing except sits in her room all day and how she must have spoken badly of her behind her back. So I clarified that she hides in her room because she's fearful (to which she asked why would my grandma be if she has done nothing wrong like biiiitch) and I requested the TV on my own accord not because my grandma was somehow bitching about anything. \*more ad hominem attacks\* No TV.

It hurts. It hurts so much. Idk why I am so easily affected by my mother's words. We barely talk but when we do it always sends me down a thought spiral and makes me cry. So here I am, typing this out, teary-eyed with nowhere to go because of COVID and no privacy to let it out or call somebody because everyone is at home. I don't want the rest of my family to know I'm upset because this is additional emotional labour on them -- they are also tired this family dynamic.

It's only my 2nd day home and I'm moving back to campus in Aug. I feel like I cannot go on anymore. I'm tired of walking on eggshells and having all these crazy shit bog me down and distracting me from studying. I'm posting this on this subreddit because idk where else to turn to for help. I need both short and long term advice. Short term: I definitely need therapy to work out years and years of damage, and judging by my reaction today I need it urgently. I know of generic helplines I can call but it'll be nice if someone (with experience) can direct me to something useful and specific. Cost is a concern since I'm just a uni student and I'm funding this on my own. Long term: What do I do with a toxic family? It seems like the tension between my mother and grandma cannot be resolved and I've come to a point of acceptance already (my bro hasn't though). If I could move out right now and cut ties with her I totally would but the thing is, the rest of my loved ones will continue to suffer in the house. This thought bogs me down every day because it's one thing to be in pain yourself but it's even more painful to see your loved ones hurting. It's much more complicated if the toxic person is your family member not a friend or a partner. So to anyone out there who has grown up with a toxic parent, please share.

Well it has been 1.5h since the whole episode started and I lowkey regret sending the message to make my grandma a little happier. I'm still crying and I hate that I'm like this. My mother is literally incapable of proper reasoning and jumps to her defenses SO FAST. Idk how to leave the room and face her now. I'm already dealing with anxiety issues and there's this. I'm fucking tired.

Edit: Some of you have pointed out that I should involve my father in this. During a fight between my mother and I last year he told me that when push comes to shove one day, he will get a divorce, though that is really the last resort, especially since my bro will be caught in the middle. My bro feels some obligation towards her because he's like the only family member she talks to and worries that she'll do something stupid if someone were to raise divorce.

My first thought was for my children and my husband.""\n\n&gt; It was an all-too-familiar experience for Ms Nadia, who was discharged from CGH on March 29 after being hospitalised for about three weeks.\n\n&gt; ON THE BRINK OF DEATH\n\n&gt; Back in 2009, she woke up from her sleep one night feeling breathless after having flu symptoms for a few days.\n\n&gt; ""I was thinking it was just a normal cold,"" said Ms Nadia, who dreamt that she was drowning.\n\n&gt; Related Story Days in ICU scariest of my life: Coronavirus patient in Singapore shares his experience\n\n&gt; ""I woke up gasping for air. It was as though my lungs were not functioning.""\n\n&gt; By then, her sister, who was staying in the same room, was already by her side and had called for their father to take her to CGH, the hospital nearest to their home, recalled Ms Nadia.\n\n&gt; Very quickly, her lips turned blue from lack of oxygen and she was slipping in and out of consciousness. She was on the brink of death.\n\n&gt; ""I really thought I wouldn\'t make it. On the way there, my sister was rubbing my back and shouting for my dad to drive faster because \'kakak won\'t make it\',"" she said.\n\n&gt; ""My lungs felt on fire and my eyes were watery. I was gasping, trying hard to get air in. In my mind, I was telling God that I was ready if my life ended.""\n\n&gt; When she reached the hospital, healthcare workers rushed her into the facility in a wheelchair and checked her temperature.\n\n&gt; Before blacking out, she overheard one of them telling another that her temperature was 43 deg C.\n\n&gt; ""I couldn\'t recall anything else afterwards,"" said Ms Nadia, who later tested positive for H1N1 and was placed in an isolation ward. ""The ward I was in then looked exactly the same as the one now.""\n\n&gt; In 2009, H1N1 was a global pandemic. In Singapore alone, more than 400,000 people were infected within the span of less than a year. About 20 people here died from it.\n\n&gt; Ms Nadia required a ventilator to breathe and drugs were administered through her veins.\n\n&gt; Her condition eventually stabilised, and she was discharged after nearly two weeks.\n\n&gt; Ever since, every time she feels unwell, she seeks medical help without hesitation because of the unpleasant experience with H1N1.\n\n&gt; BURDENED WITH GUILT\n\n&gt; This time around, X-ray checks showed patches in Ms Nadia\'s lungs, and she was sent to an isolation room.\n\n&gt; ""I wasn\'t surprised because my lungs have always been weak, but I wasn\'t thinking about Covid-19 at all,"" said Ms Nadia, who told her 38-year-old husband to stay home to look after their children.\n\n&gt; ""I did not pack anything with me. I thought that I would be out soon.""\n\n&gt; But then she tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\n&gt; Related Story Coronavirus: Couple fought virus together in hospital\n\n&gt; Ms Nadia was listed as an imported case because of her work trip to Jakarta between March 6 and 8. But she said she has no idea where or how she contracted the virus, as her close contacts in Indonesia are well.\n\n&gt; ""I was burdened with guilt. I didn\'t know how to break the news to my husband. I eventually called him and he was calm,"" said Ms Nadia, who was put in an isolation room with an attached toilet.\n\n&gt; She recalled apologising continuously to her husband, not knowing what else to say. ""Then, he said, \'Don\'t worry about us. Focus on getting better\'.""\n\n&gt; Her immediate family, including her two young children, were quarantined until March 26.\n\n&gt; During that period, her family members and friends stepped up to run errands.\n\n&gt; ""My biggest fear was the kids getting infected. I would keep praying for them,"" said Ms Nadia, who sleeps with her children on the same bed.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Ms Nadia at Changi General Hospital on March 12, where X-ray checks showed patches in her lungs, and she was sent to an isolation room. PHOTO: COURTESY OF NADIA HANIM\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; ""When I woke up every morning, I would ask about their health and if they have any symptoms. My husband would assure me that they were fine, and I would find relief in that.""\n\n&gt; Thankfully, her family members did not contract the virus.\n\n&gt; Ms Nadia would chat with her husband and children via a video call daily, but being away from them was hard to bear.\n\n&gt; ""I couldn\'t hug my kids when they were upset. I could only watch them through the screen,"" she shared. ""My elder child would ask when I was coming home. But he was aware of the situation. My younger one didn\'t say much; she just smiled at the screen and let her brother do the talking.""\n\n&gt; FIRST FEW DAYS \'FELT LIKE THE LONGEST\'\n\n&gt; The first few days after being hospitalised ""felt like the longest"", shared Ms Nadia, who used her time in isolation for reflection.\n\n&gt; ""I had so much time for myself. My schedule was always packed. I was always on the go and rarely had time for myself.""\n\n&gt; In the few days after isolation, her fever, headaches and body aches remained.\n\n&gt; A week in, more symptoms showed up. Her temperature went up again, and she had nausea and diarrhoea.\n\n&gt; ""I was rolling on my bed trying to endure the pain,"" she said.\n\n&gt; Ms Nadia, who started feeling better only after two weeks, was discharged on March 29 after her last two nasal swab tests returned negative.\n\n&gt; ""It was the most beautiful feeling,"" she said.\n\n&gt; When she stepped out of CGH, her husband was there. They got into a cab and went home.\n\n&gt; ""I didn\'t look back,"" said Ms Nadia, who was looking forward to seeing her children.\n\n&gt; ""I wanted to hug them, but I was also fearful. I knew I had recovered, but I was thinking if I should wait a few days before hugging them.""\n\n&gt; Upon reaching home, the children were ecstatic and kept jumping around, she recalled.\n\n&gt; ""I wanted to cry. I cleaned myself and got near to my kids, but still kept my distance. I knew I had to take it one step at a time.""\n\n&gt; Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself\n\n&gt; Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic\n\n&gt; Ms Nadia, who eventually got to hug and kiss her children, decided to share her experience to advise people not to take the virus lightly.\n\n&gt; ""It is worrying that there are more cases that have no links,"" she added. ""This virus can be anywhere and in anyone.""\n\n&gt; Ms Nadia also thanked the medical team for taking care of her.\n\n&gt; ""Not once did they make me feel uncomfortable or awkward because I have the virus,"" she said, adding that they would greet her cheerfully despite looking tired.\n\n&gt; She made it a point to memorise the names of all 35 healthcare workers she has met.\n\n&gt; ""These selfless healthcare workers also have loved ones waiting at home. They, too, must be worried about contracting the virus but yet they do not show it,"" she said.\n\n&gt; ""I want to remember them by their names, and not just nurse or doctor. They deserve to be acknowledged for their sacrifices.""\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herewith are strictly mine as a private citizen and has nothing to do with my employer, the National University of Singapore.  
&gt;  
&gt;For 5 years, I was working with MOE. I left on 30 Jun 2019. It was a good run while it lasted, but a couple of days ago, I realized that I can run, I cannot hide.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Thursday, MOE announced that it was going to suspend the use of Zoom pending investigations, because of some supposed breach involving obscene images. All to note that the verb is suspend, not ban.  
&gt;  
&gt;For some obscure reason, I found myself becoming the alternative MOE mCARE+ hotline (aka complaint central). Irate teachers write to me. Friends who are parents ask me why is MOE over-reacting and what are the teachers going to do now if cannot Zoom?  
&gt;  
&gt;Allow me to digress for a moment and provide some background on Zoom. Zoom is receiving a lot of flak recently for alleged privacy breaches and for apparently routing calls through China. Personally, I am sure that these issues will eventually be resolved because if not the stock price will be in freefall, so we can leave that to the company.  
&gt;  
&gt;What are my privacy concerns? Well, all Zoom gets is my NUS email address -- but that’s actually already public information. Everything else that people can steal, Facebook has probably already stolen. Students how? Well, when they login, they just need a link. They can call themselves “Mickey Mouse” or “Donald Trump” and I wouldn’t know better. What can I do? All I can do is boot them from the class if they don’t comply with my instructions to use a “real name,” so I doubt there’s much to leak. Also, I teach programming and algorithms. If people want to route my calls to learn without paying NUS, I guess there’s also no marginal cost to me.  
&gt;  
&gt;So what happened in the MOE incident? Well, it’s called Zoom bombing. How to understand this? It’s like if you sleep at night, you really should lock the door. If you park in Singapore, remember “Low Crime Doesn’t Mean No Crime” and you lock your car door. If you don’t want your neighbour to mooch your WiFi, you set a password. Simple as that. Zoom by default would suggest a password, so that’s hardly an issue. As a teacher, do I have any concerns about Zoom security? No.  
&gt;  
&gt;The MOE announcement obviously set off a panic among the teachers. These poor thing things were already scrambling to deal with HBL (home-based learning). It’s not easy to learn a new tool. They spent effort learning Zoom. Now MOE say Zoom cannot use. Of course wildspread panic lah. What do we expect? At this point, you would conclude like me (then) that MOE doesn’t know what it’s doing and over-reacted. This is a common view of the teachers on the ground who understand how to use the tool. The angst is that one teacher messes up, MOE over-reacts and the other 37,999 suffer.  
&gt;  
&gt;I write to my former colleagues and highlight problems on the ground and they explain the situation (from their perspective) to me.  
&gt;  
&gt;They are not at liberty to say this publicly, so let me be the kaypoh to defend those who cannot defend themselves. The easiest way to understand the situation is to think SAF.  
&gt;  
&gt;SAF has this thing called TSR (Training and Safety Regulations). Everyone must take the test. Every single thing that can possibly go wrong, is in there. Something goes wrong that is not in the rules, add another rule. It’s probably as comprehensive as it can get.  
&gt;  
&gt;Still people get heat stroke and die. Actually dun have to ask, 99% is non-compliance of lawful order. But if someone dies, SAF still must suspend training and investigate what (even if it’s patently obviously it’s because someone did something they should not that is already covered by some rule in the TSR). These are the lives of our children at stake. Similarly, MOE has this obscene photo breach problem. Can MOE happily ignore and continue and potentially put the other students and teachers at risk? Cannot what.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ultimately, what’s the conclusion? Same like the TSR issue. Teachers have already been issued this comprehensive list of guidelines, which sadly, TL;DR people don’t read or missed some parts. If the teachers use the MOE-issued SSOE laptops, I was told that the Zoom sessions already locked down by default (probably explains why investigation had to be done. Likely teacher was using his/her personal device).  
&gt;  
&gt;Teachers please be kind to MOE HQ. Incident happened on Thursday. People are working OT on a public holiday to quickly wrap up the investigation and send an advisory to the HOD/ICTs the next day so that HBL can continue on Monday. How much more blood do people want out of stone? HQ sometimes might fall short, but in this particular instance, people have all tried to do their jobs as best as they can -- and as far as I can tell, they cannot be faulted. If MOE did nothing after the incident was reported, you can also imagine the kind of flak that MOE would receive.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you’re still following, then the next natural question is: whose fault? Teacher’s fault for not being able to follow instructions? Or is it MOE’s fault for not training the teachers properly?  
&gt;  
&gt;If you are asking this question, you are out of your mind. Let’s have some context. Out of the blue, we now have some 38,000 teachers and 500,000 students doing HBL. Do know you how massive those numbers are? Did you pass your math? Having just one incident is frankly a miracle in and of itself (but we still have a couple more weeks to go, so might be premature to count chickens).  
&gt;  
&gt;Should we punish the teacher for non-compliance of lawful order? If you are asking this, are you nuts? We have a poor teacher who is already struggling with technology and traumatized by the incident, and the first thing we can think of is to find fault??  
&gt;  
&gt;I happen to be one of the rare profs who has been teaching online for the past 6 years. So perhaps I can share some perspective on HBL. It is hard on the teachers.  
&gt;  
&gt;In case people think that online teaching is just like classroom teaching, banish that thought. It is same same but different. I probably took 3 years to figure it out. Not sure if people read Wuxia, but the best analogy I can find to explain this to people is the Return of the Condor Heroes.  
&gt;  
&gt;In that story, there’s this hero called Yang Guo (杨过). He was an accomplished swordsman, but he got one arm chopped off and he had to learn how to fight again with just one arm.  
&gt;  
&gt;Moving from physical classroom teaching to online teaching is not just v different, it’s completely different. The better a teacher you are in the classroom, the more crippled you will feel online. Take it from me that the teachers are not having a good time and the transition is challenging. This is especially so for the older teachers who are not familiar with technology.  
&gt;  
&gt;Why am I writing this? Because I was handling this complaint on behalf of MOE from an irate parent-friend and I quote:  
&gt;  
&gt;“Ridiculous One incident cause all kids not to have online Stupid teacher , don’t follow instructions”  
&gt;  
&gt;I told her was not being fair to MOE and to the teacher. There are probably many other parents and teachers who are upset by this incident. I hope that this note helps to put things into perspective. My dear friends and fellow countryman.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a country, we are going through a v difficult period. Folks at MOE and our teachers are all working very hard, doing their level best to ensure that notwithstanding the Circuit Breaker, your child continues to have a good education.  
&gt;  
&gt;They will not do everything perfectly well. But these are not ordinary times. No amount of training MOE can provide the teachers can ensure that.  
&gt;  
&gt;Things will go wrong from time to time -- and we have another 3 more weeks (possibly more) to go. Can we all try to be kinder and more patient? No need for bouquets lah. Just try to be more understanding can? Thanks for listening.  
&gt;  
&gt;Together, we will overcome.

31,singapore,226378,COVID-19 predictions - Expect a sharp rise in cases in 2 weeks &amp; extension/solidification of circuit breaker,fvq6io,ZeroPauper,1586138817,230,11,"Two weeks ago I [suggested a significant rise in new cases](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fmgp4a/psa_everyone_has_a_social_responsibility_to_keep/)due to the influx of returning students &amp; ignorant people enjoying their social lives as per normal.

Yesterday, we witnessed a [record daily spike of 120 COVID-19 cases](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-singapore-record-daily-spike-120-new-cases-workers-dorms-12611132). Well, anyone could've predicted this easily, given the current knowledge on the [COVID-19 incubation time](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/).

Today, I am going to go out on a limb and predict once again that we will see another huge spike 2 weeks from now. Circuit breaker will be extended beyond the 1 month, or it might get solidified into a full lockdown. 

# Why? 

Just take a look at the crowds we had at Ikea, supermarkets, popular and even Toys“R”Us (Really? toys are essential?). The best method to fight this invisible enemy is to avoid crowds, 1 infected person can potentially spread it to a large crowd. 

Take a leaf out of some of the badly hit countries (I'm using examples of mass gatherings, but you can see the point - Every gathering, big or small helps the invisible enemy spread its wings):

*  [France's Smurf festival](https://www.businessinsider.sg/france-landerneau-guinness-world-record-smurf-festival-coronavirus-outbreak-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T) on 7 March while they had 1,784 cases. Today they have [**89,953**](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) 
*  [Spain's women's day march](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2020/03/09/thousands-march-in-spain-on-women039s-day-despite-coronavirus-fears) on 9 March while they had 1,231 cases. Today they have **130,759** 
*  [Football match in Italy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/bergamo-mayor-says-football-match-escalated-coronavirus-infections-italian-province) on 19 February while they had 3 cases. Today they have **124,632**

# Circuit breaker relies on trusting Singaporeans to do the right things

The circuit breaker acts as a guideline to urge Singaporeans to stay at home, but can we really trust people to follow this guideline? Just today, coffeeshops were crowded with people drinking beer, casually chatting. Void decks were filled with youngsters loitering. People taking the past 2 days as the ""last chance"" to meet friends and go out to have fun. 

What will change in the weeks to come? Yes, non-essential shops will close, hawker centers will be takeaway only. But what's to stop people who choose to have gatherings in houses, void decks or public spaces? What's to stop people from takeaway-ing only to gather somewhere else to eat? 

Singaporeans are not taking this seriously enough. If they were, then we wouldn't see people heading out for leisure in the past 2 days. 

Let's take a look at populations that didn't take it seriously:

* [Beachgoers in the US](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-governor-refuses-shut-down-beaches-amid-spread-coronavirus-n1162226), now they have **330,379** cases
* [Britons who didn't take social distancing seriously](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/03/22/many-britons-are-not-taking-social-distancing-for-covid-19-seriously), now they have **47,806** cases
* [People in Italy outside their red-zone going to bars and restaurants](https://www.thelocal.it/20200318/learn-from-our-mistakes-italians-plead-with-people-abroad-to-take-coronavirus-risks-seriously), now they have **124,632** cases
* [Just 5 days ago in New York City](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fseld1/nyc_is_taking_this_seriously_look_at_this_crowd/) they had [48,575](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_New_York_City#Data) cases then, now they have [122,031](https://covid19tracker.health.ny.gov/views/NYS-COVID19-Tracker/NYSDOHCOVID-19Tracker-DailyTracker?%3Aembed=yes&amp;%3Atoolbar=no&amp;%3Atabs=n) cases

As long as there's a portion of people who don't take it seriously, the invisible enemy will win. Singapore has had the benefit of being a small island state with a government that took early precautions, but all that hard work is all for nothing if the people are **complacent and ignorant**.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fvq6io/covid19_predictions_expect_a_sharp_rise_in_cases/,0.0,"['Keep fucking around and we are going to take longer to go through with this, both the CB and the Pandemic.']"

And she had tested positive,” said the 25-year-old woman, who requested not to be named.\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; “I felt that I needed to ask her what were her symptoms. It was a sore throat, cough and loss of smell and taste … I was like ‘Oh my gosh.’”\n\n&gt; She and her husband had recently returned from London, where they were based as he pursued further studies. And days before returning home, they had recovered from what seemed like a mild bout of the common cold.\n\n&gt; “The weather was very cold those few days, it was raining as well. We were just very cold,” she said. “My body felt warm but I didn’t feel too terrible. We just didn’t go out and stayed at home … I told my husband that since we didn’t go to the crowded places in London, we should be fine.”\n\n&gt; And when it came to social distancing, the couple had taken all the necessary precautions. Not attending the usual church service, not heading out farther than the neighbourhood, not going out to crowded areas.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; A woman walks past graffiti on a wall in Brentford, as the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues, London, Britain, April 1, 2020. REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\n&gt; “I felt that it was impossible that I would have gotten COVID-19,” added the 25-year-old husband, who also requested not to be named. “We had been socially responsible in the last one or two weeks before coming home … The swift recovery made it clear to me that it was just a common cold or something like that.""\n\n&gt; So when the cold disappeared, they thought little of it.\n\n&gt; “There was no fever, no flu, no anything,” she said. “He only had a cough … a kind of cough once in a couple of hours. For me, when I had my flu, I couldn’t smell and taste, so I thought that was normal for somebody who had just recovered from the flu.”\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; While serving her Stay Home Notice after returning from the UK, what was perplexing for the wife was that her sense of taste and smell still had not returned.\n\n&gt; “It was frustrating because my body felt well, but I just couldn’t smell and taste,” she said. “At that point our bodies felt perfectly fine, but we didn’t know there was a virus inside of us.\n\n&gt; “It got a bit worrying because I felt that it wasn’t normal to lose both these senses. I was wondering if it was a nerve issue … I could stand beside my husband frying garlic, and I still couldn’t smell anything.”\n\n&gt; After the conversation with her friend on Instagram, things started to click into place. “I felt very worried after that because out of her three symptoms, the both of us could identify to one of each,” she said.\n\n&gt; The couple decided to call the People’s Association and an ambulance swiftly arrived to take them to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).\n\n&gt; Medical staff preparing pre-screening procedures at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases building at Tan Tock Seng Hospital in Singapore on Jan 31, 2020. (Photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman)\n\n&gt; “Everything was done in a professional manner - they were completely suited up because they had to come into the house,” she recalled. “I was very scared the neighbours might see it. People are rather unsettled at the moment and I was afraid that they might ostracise us or that they would be living in fear.”\n\n&gt; After thorough questioning and tests at NCID, the couple were sent home and told to wait on the results of the tests.\n\n&gt; Her husband was later found to be COVID-19 positive and admitted to NCID, while his wife was found to be negative.\n\n&gt; “The reason why we wanted to get tested is because he was convinced that I would be positive and he would be negative, we didn’t expect that he would be the one who would have been tested positive,” she said.\n\n&gt; But at the same time, she wasn’t convinced that she was COVID-19 free.\n\n&gt; “I didn’t feel very confident of the results based on my symptoms,” she said. “At that point of time there were more articles online about the loss of smell and taste, how that is a crucial symptom for the virus. So I really thought I had it.”\n\n&gt; After making a few calls and explaining her situation, she was eventually sent to the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) for testing on Mar 26. This time, she was warded, even before the tests results were out.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; File photo of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. (Photo: Facebook/Khoo Teck Puat Hospital)\n\n&gt; “I remember there were three people with me as I was on the wheelchair to be transported to the ward,” she recalled. “One in front of me, one was pushing me and one was behind me … One of them would call on the walkie-talkie to say that they were in the process of transferring me up and told everybody in my path to clear.\n\n&gt; “I was quite impressed that just to transfer one patient they had to coordinate with so many departments, it wasn’t just about preparing the ward itself.”\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; At 6.30am the next morning, she was informed that she had tested positive. “The doctor said he suspected that I was nearing the tail-end of the infection, but because the virus was still in me, I still have to be here as you can still spread it to people,” she said.\n\n&gt; For the next few days, she was in a ward by herself, with nothing but a phone and a charger - there had been no opportunity for her to return home from KTPH after being tested.\n\n&gt; “The days felt very long and there was nobody to talk to,” she recalled. “What I could do was text and call people, some times make video calls … It was a very weird feeling, even though I was digitally connected to people, it felt that I was isolated as well.”\n\n&gt; “Some days we do feel that it would be nice to walk around and catch a breather, or have the freedom to do something that you like,” added her husband, who was later transferred to Gleneagles Hospital. “But we know why we are here.”\n\n&gt; But to know that her husband was also able to understand what she was going through also helped, she said. “We could understand the discomfort of the swab for example, these were the kind of small things that only we could relate,” she said.\n\n&gt; The support of friends and family have been encouraging throughout the couple’s stay in the hospital, said the husband.\n\n&gt; “You see the community of family and friends banding around you and sending you messages of encouragement,” he said. “Sometimes it\'s a bit funny because you feel totally fine but people are sending you all these things! But the intent is very encouraging.”\n\n&gt; The kindness and professionalism of the nurses was also something that stood out.\n\n&gt; “Sometimes I couldn’t recognise the nurses, because when they came in they were masked (in full PPE), so I tried to remember them by their voices,” she said. “One of them left me a note and I was really touched. It’s really the fact that you are so void of physical contact that something like that made me very happy.\n\n&gt; “When the nurses would come in, they would also ask how my husband was … It was quite nice that they talked to me and not just did their job.”\n\n&gt; After five nights in an isolation ward and two consecutive negative swab tests, she could finally be discharged. Her sense of smell and taste have not returned fully, but doctors have assured her that she was virus free and this would come with time.\n\n&gt; “Losing my sense of taste and smell - it was something that I never ever thought I would lose, until you realise how important it is in your daily life,” she said.\n\n&gt; But with her husband still currently warded, it has been a bittersweet feeling to have been discharged.\n\n&gt; “It would have been nice to come out together,” she explained. “Even though I know he has no symptoms now, I know that the fact that he is still testing positive, which is cause of concern.""\n\n&gt; Said her husband, who has now been in hospital for over a week: “The thing that is unsettling is that we do not know the extent of its spread among the community because of the mildness of some of the symptoms.""\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; ""Being tested positive for COVID-19, you really don’t know when you can be discharged,"" added his wife. ""You don’t know if your next swab test will be negative or positive.”\n\n&gt; \n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

(Photo: Marcus Mark Ramos)\n\n&gt; This comes as the Government announced sweeping new measures on Friday to curb the outbreak amid a rising number of local and unlinked cases. These include urging people to stay at home and closing schools and most workplaces.\n\n&gt; ""We are at a critical juncture in this fight against COVID-19,"" Commander 6th Singapore Division Brigadier-General (BG) Lee Yi-Jin, who oversees the SAF\'s contact tracing operations, said on Friday.\n\n&gt; ""When MOH asked us for our support, we were very clear that this is something that we have to do, step up and step forward.""\n\n&gt; CONTACT TRACING\n\n&gt; SAF contact tracers work nine-hour shifts and get assigned a number of cases each day based on Singapore\'s case tally for the day. Their workload also depends on how many people a confirmed case could have infected.\n\n&gt; A big part of their job is to assess whether a close contact of a confirmed case needs to be quarantined. Personnel are trained to ask questions about the physical distance, duration and nature of the interaction.\n\n&gt; Those who are issued a quarantine order over the phone must go home immediately. A physical copy of the order will be issued at a later date.\n\n&gt; ""Some are quite shocked, but the ones I encountered are quite happy to leave work immediately,"" said Lance Corporal Muhammad Audi Ahmad, 22, a full-time national serviceman (NSF) who is part of the contact tracing team.\n\n&gt; ""Some people try to rationalise their opinion, saying I shouldn\'t get quarantined and stuff like that. We try our best to explain why the decision was made as per MOH guidelines, and slowly they will comply accordingly.""\n\n&gt; SAF contact tracers also study the activity maps of confirmed cases issued by hospitals, figure out where the patient had been in the two days before hospitalisation, and call the patient or his close contacts if more information is needed.\n\n&gt; SAF personnel conducting contact tracing at Mandai Hill Camp. (Photo: Marcus Mark Ramos)\n\n&gt; For instance, a patient declaring he took one-and-a-half hours to get to a clinic from his home via taxi would raise questions.\n\n&gt; ""We would ask him to give us the exact timings and what he was doing right before and after, to ensure we are able to trace correctly all the places has been to and who he has met,"" said Ms Tiffany Chua, a MINDEF non-uniformed officer who is helping out with contact tracing.\n\n&gt; While issuing quarantine orders is a big responsibility, the 25-year-old said she has gained confidence from observing MOH contact tracers during training.\n\n&gt; ""Four of us (from my department) volunteered for it because we thought it was very meaningful work, and we wanted to play a part in helping the nation\'s efforts,"" she added.\n\n&gt; CHECKING STAY-HOME COMPLIANCE\n\n&gt; Also playing their part are SAF servicemen who ensure people comply with stay-home notices. The Government had announced in March that anyone entering the country will be issued a 14-day stay-home notice to reduce the risk of local transmission.\n\n&gt; Personnel on this job, who work in teams of six, used to do five-hour shifts and make 50 to 100 calls a day. But the workload has gone up to nine-hour shifts making more than 200 calls a day, says NSF Third Sergeant (3SG) Reuben George Pharez, 22.\n\n&gt; MINDEF non-uniformed officers conducting contact tracing at Mandai Hill Camp (Photo: Marcus Mark Ramos)\n\n&gt; 3SG Pharez said the SAF personnel will call individuals who have been unresponsive to ICA\'s text messages. If they pick up, they will need use an application to prove they are home, and give reasons why they had not responded before.\n\n&gt; Common reasons for missing the text messages, 3SG Pharez said, include not checking their phones because they were sleeping or cooking.\n\n&gt; SAF personnel will call up to five times before declaring someone uncontactable, with 3SG Pharez saying two out of 10 people a day fall in this group.\n\n&gt; Some individuals are also uncooperative when called, 3SG Pharez said, insisting that they are at home because the number dialled is a landline, although landlines can be redirected to mobile phones too.\n\n&gt; ""We try to be patient with them, we flag it out that they are uncooperative, and ICA manages them,"" he said. ""We try not to interact with them as much.""\n\n&gt; Another difficulty, these personnel said, is when people doubt their authority, especially as they don\'t identify as being from SAF, but acting on behalf of the MOH or ICA. In this case, the personnel said they will give respective hotlines for verification.\n\n&gt; Still, they said the job is rewarding as most people are understanding and thankful for their work.\n\n&gt; ""They appreciate the fact that you\'re calling them to check on them,"" 3SG Pharez said. ""They mention that is heartwarming to know that the public is also willingly cooperating to fight the virus.""\n\n&gt; While BG Lee said the fight against COVID-19 is ""far from over"", he believes his charges have been adapting to different tasks and are fully focused on the mission.\n\n&gt; ""That ultimately gives me the biggest confidence and conviction that we\'re going to get through this together,"" he added.\n\n&gt; Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

To Singaporeans: do not make us go down.

Currently we are able to tide things through using whatever financial budget that Singapore has. Easing on payments, giving out stimulus and every other measures. The government has tried pumping in a lot of resources into all these tests, stay home notices and other measures. 

This is not a long term solution for us Singaporeans. Throwing money into the pit to try and slow down the spread.

 'Gahment so much money, can one la'. Of course Singapore can spend this much money but that doesn't mean we should be spending it. Cause these money is from all of us, saved up and spent wisely. 

The government is doing their best in their own ways to resolve this problem. But as long as Singaporeans continue to act irresponsibly, this situation will either become A) we run out of resources B) we can kiss our stability as a nation goodbye. 

Some cultures are toxic, that i agree. Workplaces calling people chao geng for MC-ing from work. Sick people are hence socially obligated to go in even if sick, only to become the scapegoat when shit hits the fan. 

Some people think 'aiya, wont happen one. Whats the chance? I so healthy'. Young people like that, good luck. Hope you don't get infected because your mentality will be what drags the entire country down. Just recall the Korean Ajumma. 

Let us fight this together as Singaporeans. Respect our healthcare workers, supermarket staffs and all other workers who make the country continue to run. Let us be more responsible for our own nation, or at the minimum, to our own closed ones.

There is the possibility of the outbreak getting out of hand if new cases were to shoot past 100 a day for a few days running next week, said Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, programme leader of the Infectious Diseases Programme at the National University of Singapore\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.\n\n&gt; ""If we are able to get through these two weeks without a big surge in new cases, such as above 100 a day for a few days, we will be relatively okay,"" he said.\n\n&gt; ""If the number of new cases is below 100 like now, it does not mean that the situation is not serious. It just means that our healthcare system can cope and won\'t get overwhelmed by the new cases.""\n\n&gt; This means the hospitals have enough ventilators and intensive care unit beds, he said. While there is no way of knowing exactly how many patients will end up needing intensive care, research shows that about 5 per cent of patients will be critically ill. Some 15 per cent will be moderately ill, and the remaining 80 per cent will be mildly ill, of which a minority will be asymptomatic.\n\n&gt; National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said on Wednesday that Singapore is at a ""very critical time"" on the infection curve.\n\n&gt; The number of cases in Singapore started to surge last week as residents returned from overseas. These included those who travelled during the March school holidays and students who returned home as their dormitories were closing.\n\n&gt; ""We expect some of the new cases to generate new clusters. To be frank, this is expected, once you realise there is a surge of people coming in since the end of the March holidays,"" said Prof Hsu.\n\n&gt; ""We were worried once the school holidays started, and we saw cases in the United States and Italy rise significantly.""\n\n&gt; Related Story Coronavirus: New study finds at least 10 patients in Singapore caught virus from those without symptoms\n\n&gt; Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself\n\n&gt; Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic\n\n&gt; It meant that those who had been in the US and Europe were at a higher risk of getting infected.\n\n&gt; Singapore then moved to get Singapore residents returning from Britain and the US to serve their 14-day stay-home notice at hotels from 11.59pm on March 25.\n\n&gt; However, some of those who had returned a few days before that and did not exhibit any symptoms would have gone home. They may then have gone on to unknowingly infect others.\n\n&gt; The incubation period is up to 14 days, though many people show symptoms in about five days.\n\n&gt; While new clusters can be expected, the fact that one is in a nursing home is more of a worry because the residents are elderly and have multiple health complications. These residents are put in nursing homes because they need help with daily living activities.\n\n&gt; They are thus at increased risk of becoming critically ill from the coronavirus and dying from it.\n\n&gt; Elsewhere, nursing homes are hotbeds for Covid-19 infection.\n\n&gt; As for clusters at foreign worker dormitories, these can grow as the dorms are home to thousands of workers.\n\n&gt; The consolation is that the residents are largely young and healthy, so while the risk of individuals getting infected is high, the chances of becoming critically ill are low, said Prof Hsu.\n\n&gt; Workers may be housed in cramped spaces, but if the close contacts of the patients are quarantined early, the outbreak can be nipped in the bud, he said.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

Looking at our DORSCON system, there seems to be insufficient information on the exact practices for each system, and contingency plans.

For example, if you look at the pdf attached in the link, we are more or less practising Red measures while still in Orange.

To be honest, social distancing should be in Yellow or Orange, just to varying degrees. For example, the Red category should be on the level of lockdown, instead of social distancing, which is crucial in stemming local cases and unlinked cases.

H1N1 is clearly too mild of a case for reference of DORSCON. Seeing as how long more this fight against COVID-19 will be, is it time to update this 2014 DORSCON system?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ftfk6t/will_there_be_a_review_of_the_current_doscon/,0.0,['No use updating an arbitrary system.

My name is Johnathan, I'm reaching out on behalf of a team of analysts advising health organizations and agencies in their fight against Covid-19. Our objective is to gather data and information on how different countries deal with and fight the pandemic - and through that hopefully advise others how they can better fight Covid-19. Since Singapore is relatively dealing well with the current outbreak, we are eager to learn from you.

**We would like to ask for your help with recommendations for sources, experts and/or websites that we could learn from about Covid-19 in Singapore.**

**Also, we would like to hear from you and from your personal knowledge**, every little piece of information can help:

* **Public space** \- Are you allowed outside? must you wear masks or gloves if so? Is there still public transportation? Are there public disinfection sites outside? Does the government disinfect public places?
* **Getting checked** \- How are people being checked for the virus? What technology is being used to check? Where do people go to, to get checked? How do you decide who needs to get checked?
* **Using quarantine** \- What steps were taken and when? Who is placed under quarantine? Who still can go to work? How is the quarantine enforced? Are people under surveillance?
* **Learning from the past** \- What did you learn from SARS? How were you better prepared for Covid-19? Do you have special ""National alertness"" stages? what do they mean?
* **Medical personnel** \- How are medical personnel and their families are being kept safe?
* **Contact tracing** \- How is ""contact tracing"" done? How do you trace the paths of people who became sick and might have contaminated others?

That's it for now - If you are able to help us with these questions, if you know some sources or websites where we can find data and information, or know someone who is an expert in the field and is willing to help - we would appreciate it greatly.

The situation we are heading into looks more like a thunderstorm and not just a drizzle.""\n\n&gt; Advance GDP estimates released on Thursday morning show Singapore\'s economy shrank 2.2 per cent in the first quarter.\n\n&gt; The Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its 2020 growth forecast to a range of -4.0 to -1.0 per cent this year, from an earlier estimate of -0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent.\n\n&gt; The last time Singapore registered a full-year contraction of its economy was in 2001 during the Dot.com Bust when growth fell by 1 per cent.\n\n&gt; Setting out the grim economic outlook worldwide, Mr Heng said the global economy is now facing both a supply and demand shock.\n\n&gt; On the supply side, locked down workers are unable to work, and a disruption in any one country will have knock-on effects worldwide as global supply chains are highly integrated.\n\n&gt; Demand has fallen as people stay home and stop spending, he noted.\n\n&gt; The International Monetary Fund expects a recession that will at minimum rival the one during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, while financial markets are being roiled by the mounting uncertainties, he said.\n\n&gt; As an open economy that is highly integrated with the global economy, Singapore will be deeply impacted by global financial shocks, he added.\n\n&gt; The deputy prime minister recounted how there were 800 confirmed cases outside of China just five weeks ago, when he presented Budget 2020 on Feb 18.\n\n&gt; The outbreak has escalated quickly since, and the World Health Organization now estimates that there are more 410,000 cases across more than 190 countries.\n\n&gt; On the medical front, many countries have implemented lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus so their healthcare systems are not overwhelmed, he said.\n\n&gt; ""In Singapore, we are doing everything we can to keep you and your families safe,"" he said.\n\n&gt; The country has stepped up its measures as the outbreak worsened worldwide, he noted.\n\n&gt; However, the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to take at least a year to be resolved, and the economic repercussions will last even longer, Mr Heng said.\n\n&gt; ""The world is seeing successive waves of infection, and importation of infections.

Given that the country is seeing more of such cases, a whole range of additional public health measures to slow down the spread of the virus, he said.\n\n&gt; These are applied at different levels, the minister continued. For instance, there are baseline measures, such as daily temperature taking, refraining from shaking hands and practices to uphold personal hygiene which should be continued for a sustained period.\n\n&gt; Beyond that, safe distancing measures which serve as “extra brakes” to help slow down the spread, have been introduced.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; The first set, announced last Friday, suspended all activities for seniors, all events and gatherings with 250 or more participants, as well as requiring public venue operators to ensure separation of at least a metre between patrons.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; While these measures have brought about some changes, such as fewer crowded venues and alternate seats marked in dining venues, the country “will have to move faster”.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Safe distancing measures are seen at a Toast Box outlet in Chinatown.\n\n&gt; “We still hear anecdotes of people going to discos and night clubs, and gathering together in large groups – our big worry is that these can become super-spreader events, spawning new clusters and potential runaway outbreaks,” he said.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; This is why authorities announced “another set of brakes” on Tuesday, with the aim of limiting gatherings outside of work and school to less than 10 people.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; “These are major moves to slow the spread of the virus,” the minister said. “We recognise the inconvenience and disruption that these measures will bring to people’s lives, and to businesses, but we have no easy options.”\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Mr Wong noted that this is the reality that countries around the world are facing while fighting COVID-19.\n\n&gt; “The more we try to stop or slow down the virus, the steeper will be the damage on our economies.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; “So we have to do what is necessary from the public health point of view first – to save lives, slow down the virus – and thereafter, do our best to manage the economic consequences,” he said, noting that the new measures have been shared with the team at the Ministry of Finance which will take these into consideration for the second support package set to be announced on Thursday.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Discharged COVID-19 patient Ms Jiang (in yellow) poses for a photo with doctors and nurses at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.

If that is the case, Singapore may need “more drastic measures”, such as suspending schools and closure of some workplaces aside from those providing essential services.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; “So we will keep the measures under constant review.

55,singapore,222535,GovTech: 9 geeky myth-busting facts you need to know about TraceTogether,fmhm2l,Varantain,1584808132,46,1,"Reposting in full because r/Singapore doesn't allow Facebook posts. 🙄

&gt; TraceTogether (TraceTogether.gov.sg) is a mobile app that supports Singapore’s efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through community-driven contact tracing. Through the exchange of short-distance Bluetooth signals between mobile phones with the installed app, each phone can detect other participating TraceTogether phones that are in close proximity.
&gt; 
&gt; Here’s a handy list of nine geeky facts you need to know about TraceTogether.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #1 - The government is using the TraceTogether app to track or spy on every citizen’s whereabouts.**
&gt; 
&gt; No, the TraceTogether app does not collect any location data and there is no way for the government to locate your whereabouts with this app. The app uses Bluetooth technology to exchange connections with nearby devices that have the app. The app only has the ability to show connections between devices, and not their locations. Furthermore, the logs stay in your phone. Should MOH need the logs for contact tracing, they will seek your consent to share the logs with them.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #2 - With the TraceTogether app running on my mobile phone that's Bluetooth enabled, anyone, including the government, can hack into my phone and extract all information in the phone.**
&gt; 
&gt; TraceTogether uses Bluetooth, a short-range peer-to-peer communications technology that is ubiquitous in mobile phones and devices today. It can only transmit signals within a range of about 10 meters. Using 
 TraceTogether is no different as connecting other devices or wearables to your phone via Bluetooth. It is impossible for anyone to get close enough to you, and use a computer to extract information from your phone without you noticing. TraceTogether uses several layers of security to keep your data private. Find out more at: https://go.gov.sg/tracetogether-privacy.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #3 - If I download TraceTogether and give consent to all in-app functions, I am essentially allowing the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the government to collect and gain access to all my personal data, as well as the data in my phone.**
&gt; 
&gt; When you set up TraceTogether, you will only be asked for your mobile number. This is the only personal data that MOH will hold about you, and it is stored in a highly secured server together with a random anonymised User ID that is linked to your mobile number. The security level of this server is as high as those servers that store other official information.
&gt; 
&gt; All MOH will get is your phone number. Commercial apps for emails, web browsing and movie-watching collect more data about you than this app.
&gt; 
&gt; When the app is running on your phone, it will create a temporary ID, generated by encrypting the User ID with a private key that is held by MOH. The temporary ID is then exchanged with nearby phones, and renewed regularly, making it impossible for anyone to identify or link the temporary IDs to you. The temporary ID can only be decrypted by MOH, with MOH's privately-held key. Your phone will store the temporary IDs from nearby phones, together with information about the nearby phone's model, Bluetooth signal strength, and time. All this information is stored locally on your phone, and not sent to MOH, unless you are contact traced.
&gt;
&gt; These measures protect users from malicious actors who may seek to eavesdrop and track interactions over time.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #4 - If MOH contact-traced to me and asks me to upload the data stored in the TraceTogether app, the Ministry can also extract any other data that they want from my phone.**
&gt; 
&gt; When a TraceTogether user is a confirmed COVID-19 case and agrees to upload the data log in the TraceTogether app to MOH, MOH will decrypt the temporary IDs in the user’s app using its privately-held key, and obtain a list of phone numbers from the uploaded data log. Each phone number will only have the information related to the Bluetooth signal strength and time information. That is all the information that MOH will get from the user’s app log. Based on the signal strength and time information, MOH will then determine which devices were in physical proximity with the confirmed case.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #5 - I do not wish to download this TraceTogether app which will increase the risk of a data breach on my phone.**
&gt; 
&gt; The TraceTogether app does not increase the risk of a data breach on your phone. Given the TraceTogether app’s security and privacy safeguards, the risk of a data leak from your phone as a result of TraceTogether is very low. By downloading the app, you can tap on technology to enhance contact tracing -- a key pillar of Singapore’s fight against COVID-19. The choice is yours to make.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #6 - All information in the TraceTogether app is uploaded onto a server that faces a perpetual threat of being hacked into.**
&gt; 
&gt; Apart from your mobile number, at the point of registration, all data collected through the TraceTogether app is stored locally in your phone in an encrypted form. It is not uploaded to any central server. The data will never be accessed, unless you have been confirmed as a COVID-19 patient. The MOH contact tracing team will then ask you for explicit approval to access the data in your app, and it is transferred to private storage that is not exposed to the Internet.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #7 - Other TraceTogether users can see my phone number.**
&gt; 
&gt; Mobile numbers are not revealed to other TraceTogether users. Only temporary IDs, generated by encrypting the User ID with a private key that is held by MOH, are exchanged between phones. Your mobile number remains secret and is not exchanged with other mobile phones. As an added layer of protection, the temporary IDs refresh regularly. Even if you could decrypt the temporary IDs, you would still not be able to obtain the mobile numbers of people you have been in contact with.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #8 - Even after I uninstall the TraceTogether app, my mobile number and the randomised User ID will remain in the server forever.**
&gt; 
&gt; Once the app is uninstalled or TraceTogether’s functionality disabled, all connection data collected on your phone will be lost. You can also request for your mobile number and User ID to be removed from the server by sending an email to support@tracetogether.gov.sg. This immediately renders all data collected by other TraceTogether phones about their interactions with you meaningless, because that data can no longer be associated with you.
&gt; 
&gt; Once contact tracing activities cease, the TraceTogether will prompt users to deactivate its functionality.
&gt; 
&gt; **Myth #9 - Running the TraceTogether app in the background uses up a lot of data and phone battery.**
&gt;
&gt; The app uses about 1MB of data in a day, which is equivalent to the data used by watching 1 second of a high definition movie, and consumes only marginally more battery than phones that already have Bluetooth enabled.

&gt; 
&gt; If you are convinced now that the app can do more good than harm, download the app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.tech.bluetrace&amp;hl=en) or the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/tracetogether/id1498276074) and help everyone at home to download too.

(OP edit: no idea why the iOS App Store link was to the US App Store, so I've changed it to the SG one.)

62,singapore,212412,Coronavirus: S'pore reports first cases of local transmission; 4 out of 6 new cases did not travel to China,eynxb2,eaterasers,1580810797,16,1,"SINGAPORE - Singapore has recorded its first cases of local coronavirus transmission, with four women here infected who had not travelled to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.

Two work at Yong Thai Hang, a Chinese health products shop in Cavan Road in Lavender which caters to Chinese tour groups.

The third is a maid of one of the women, while the fourth is a tour guide who had taken groups to the same shop.

The tour group in question has since returned to China.

In addition, another two confirmed cases were announced on Tuesday (Feb 4).

The two were among a group of 92 people flown back to Singapore from Wuhan on a Scoot flight last Thursday. Before this, another two on the same flight had been reported as confirmed cases.

In total, there are now 24 confirmed cases in Singapore.


The new cases constitute ""limited local transmission"", the Health Ministry said on Tuesday.

""There is however no widespread evidence of widespread community transmission,"" said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong at a press conference.

""It is possible that there could be broader community spread despite our best efforts,"" he told reporters.

Should that happen, Singapore will consider additional measures to reduce human-to-human interactions, such as cancelling mass gatherings, suspending schools, and paring down non-essential care services, to slow the spread of disease.

The country has been preparing for such clusters, and measures implemented so far have been directed towards preventing and containing the risk of spread beyond such local clusters, to the broader community, MOH said.

As surveillance has been stepped up, more such local clusters are expected, including more cases of local transmission, it added.

The ministry has also started contact tracing so as to ringfence the cluster and limit further spread.

Cases with limited community transmission are not unexpected, said Mr Gan, who co-chairs a multi-ministry task force to defend the country against the virus.

""This is a scenario which we are prepared for,"" he said, noting that efforts will help reduce the risk of escalation.

""As the situation evolves we will step up our posture accordingly to further contain the situation in Singapore.""

With local transmission happening here, the Government is stepping up cleaning of public areas, as well as measures to lower the risk for vulnerable groups such as young children and the elderly.

To keep students safe, for instance, schools will implement staggered recess times, and stop activities such as mass assemblies and school camps. Eldercare facilities will also suspend excursions and large-scale gatherings.

As an added precaution, the authorities said they are also contacting people with similar profiles to the four cases of local transmission, who have had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to China.

In addition, all patients with pneumonia at public hospitals have been tested for the 2019-nCoV, as the virus is called, since last week.

Current evidence suggests that the virus can be spread by droplets from infected individuals, and the best way to prevent this is through personal hygiene and social responsibility. Businesses and organisations are also advised to clean their premises more often, especially high-traffic areas.

The earlier 18 confirmed cases of the virus here were all imported, comprising 16 Chinese nationals and two Singaporeans who had all travelled recently to Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province.

One has been discharged, said the ministry on Tuesday.

The update was given after a two-day lull on Sunday and Monday, when no new cases were reported.

The coronavirus outbreak shows no signs of abating, and while Singapore has put in place multiple lines of defence to check cases coming in from abroad or being passed within the community, it must prepare for a long fight against the virus, Mr Gan told Parliament on Monday.

It was first reported in Wuhan late last year. As of Monday, it had infected more than 20,000 people and claimed over 420 lives, mainly in China.

Outside mainland China, there have been close to 300 cases and two deaths, one each in Hong Kong and the Philippines.

Global authorities have warned of more person-to-person spread, with the United States, Thailand, South Korea and Hong Kong all reporting local transmission.

On Tuesday, Malaysian health authorities also confirmed the first citizen to be infected with the new coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 10. They said the 41-year-old Malaysian had travelled to Singapore for a meeting last month with colleagues from China - including one from Wuhan. But he showed symptoms only on Jan 29, nearly a week after he returned to Malaysia.

Chinese data suggest that the new virus, while much more contagious than Sars, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly. It very likely passed from certain wild animals to humans at the Wuhan's South China Seafood Market and then evolved into human-to-human transmission.

Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei and all non-essential travel to China, while visitors with recent travel to China or those with Chinese passports will not be allowed entry.

The six new cases:

- The 19th case is a 28-year-old Singapore resident, a woman who had no recent travel history to China. She works as a salesperson at health product shop Yong Thai Hang at 24, Cavan Road in Jalan Besar, that primarily served Chinese tourists.

She developed a sore throat and fever last Wednesday (Jan 29) and was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) last Thursday, but was discharged from hospital after her chest X-Ray result came back negative for pneumonia.

She did not leave her home at Jalan Bukit Merah from Friday to Sunday and was admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on Monday.

- The 20th case is a 48-year-old Singapore resident, a woman who also had no recent travel history to China. She lived at Hougang Street 61 and also worked at Yong Thai Hang.

She reported symptoms on Jan 25 and was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Monday.

- The 21st case is a 44-year-old Indonesian woman who also had no recent travel history to China. She is the domestic helper of case 19, and stayed with her employer in her home at Jalan Bukit Merah. She reported symptoms on Sunday and did not leave her home since then.

She was admitted to SGH on Monday.

The 22nd and 23rd cases are Singapore residents evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. They did not have symptoms when they boarded the flight and were quarantined when they landed in Singapore.

The two cases tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday even though they still showed no symptoms.

They are now warded in isolation rooms at NCID.

All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were, as an added precaution, tested for the coronavirus.

Case 24 is a 32-year-old Singapore resident who has no recent travel history in China.

She is a tour guide who brought tour groups to Yong Thai Hang, the same shop where cases 19 and 20 worked.

The tour guide did not show any symptoms when she went to NCID on Monday. She was immediately isolated and is now warded in an isolation room in the centre.

She tested positive for the virus on Tuesday afternoon.

Also according to them, there are several ways to identify fake news. 1) Unreliable Source 2) Reputable sites aren't carrying the story (AKA Mainstream media outlets) 3) The story is too good to be true 4) It triggers strong emotions

I have a few questions in my mind when I saw this on the website and I was hoping if someone could shed some light on them.

What are the techniques used by officials when gathering information and what is the verification process like when assessing the reliability of collected information? Do people actually check the original source when looking at the news or is it simply a medium where news outlets recycle information from their reputable counterparts?

What makes a source unreliable? Who does the verification for all the videos posted on various media platforms? (e.g. videos from people living in Wuhan currently) How is the process like?

Do news outlets actually bother to validate/confirm the citations made in articles or is it assumed to be accurate the moment there is a citation made from the originating article? Who verifies the originating article (the source) then? (Example: The Eight Spiders)

Do we not reach a point where information becomes circular and all we are seeing is news outlets cross-referencing each other?

Hey all! It seems most of you guys here know that the mental health scene and stigma is still very strong and discriminating in our modern society and it goes to show how hard someone with a mental health condition like depression, anxiety, bipolar, personality disorder etc. has to go through just to find help or even just someone to talk to about their feelings.

I've had enough of the discrimination and marginalisation towards people with mental health conditions and hence, what I've been working on the past few months is creating a closed non-profit telegram support group for you guys of all backgrounds to come together to support one another, as well as advice each other when one is going through a tough time.

I am French, but I lived in Singapore few years ago. I would like to share a message regarding the Coronavirus Outbreak.

Singapore has a top-notched healthcare system. Furthermore, Singaporeans are smart and well-educated. I am very confident in the fact that you will do everything possible to fight the outbreak, and you will succeed. Because you’re smart, and you act the right way. I hope everything will be ok for you (I am a lot more confident in Singapore government and Singaporeans to deal with this situation than in my own government and French people).

Just wanted to share this message, because I love your country, and love Singaporeans (you’re amazing, it was such a pleasure to live among you!). Wish you the best!",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ewlafa/current_situation_in_singapore/,0.0,['thank you :)']

They are selfish and they are not helpful for collective defence.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n“Collective defence is our strongest defence. We must all act in unison, act together and not jeopardise the system by doing things that we think might benefit ourselves, protect ourselves, but to the detriment to everyone else in the society.”\n\nThe warning came after the Government released 5 million masks from the national stockpile to retailers in the past nine days, only to see them snapped up within hours of their release.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\nSome sellers have also tried to profit from the surge in demand. Authorities have, for instance, issued warning letters to Deen Express, a shop at 313 Somerset, which was said to be selling masks at S$68 or S$88 for a box of 20 N95 masks.\n\nSellers on online marketplaces Carousell and Qoo10 have also been spotted selling masks at about up to 20 times their usual retail price.\n\nRead also: Govt to distribute masks to all 1.37 million Singapore households amid Wuhan virus outbreak\n\n\n\nMr Chan said Singaporeans should not support such profiteers, and should be more judicious about their use of masks, pointing out that people should only use masks when they are feeling unwell and need to leave the house to seek medical attention.\n\n“If we do this systematically, calmly, pace ourselves, we will be able to manage our stockpile, manage the usage rate and the uncertainties,” he said.\n\nRead also: Economies of Singapore, Thailand to be hardest hit in Asean by Wuhan virus: Analysts’ report\n\nHis comments came as the Government announced it would distribute masks to all households in Singapore from Feb 1.\n\nHOW THE GOVT MANAGES MASK STOCKPILE\n\nThe Government’s management of Singapore’s national stockpile of masks is based on three factors, said Mr Chan.\n\nRead also: Wuhan virus: Online firms Carousell, Qoo10 threaten to suspend sellers charging inflated prices for face masks\n\nThey are: How much Singapore currently has in its stockpile, how fast Singaporeans are using up the stockpile, and how many or how frequently masks can be resupplied.\n\nBut the usage rate in the past one week had greatly surpassed what would be reasonably expected, upsetting the equation, he said.\n\n“We understand that when people are fearful, there’s a tendency to panic buy or hoard. But this is not very useful to the entire system,” he said.\n\nRead also: Explainer: How residences and commercial buildings exposed to the Wuhan virus should be disinfected\n\n“If we do not manage the private usage rate and prioritise the allocation, we will deprive our essential services, especially the healthcare services, of the masks, and this will in turn jeopardise our entire healthcare system, not allowing us to take care of those who need it the most.”\n\nAt the same briefing, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said that Singapore’s current rate of consumption of masks is “not sustainable”, especially with a global shortage of masks and likely export bans that other countries might implement, as the Wuhan situation unfolds and face their own mask supply shortages.\n\nPointing out that this is a “global contingency” with no signs of abating at this point, Mr Chan said Singapore cannot assume that supply lines will remain unconstrained and unaffected by “the competition of others who are taking action to secure their own supply lines”.\n\nHe cited recent news of mask producers prioritising China, the epicentre of the virus, and Taiwan banning the export of surgical masks.\n\nHe added that there are other uses of face masks now, including in Australia where a bushfire crisis continues to brew.\n\n“Prepare for the long haul, but never, never succumb to the short-term fears and panic buying and hoarding behaviours, because these will destroy the entire system that we have,” said Mr Chan.\n\nMr Wong said: “Remember: At the end of the day, masks do not confer automatic protection against the virus… The best thing that every Singaporean can do to protect himself, herself and their family members is to uphold good personal hygiene.”\n\nHe added: “Wash your hands regularly with soap. Don’t touch your face with your hands, because when your hands are dirty and you touch your face without realising it – the mucous membranes, your eyes, your nose, your mouth, that is how viruses spread.”']"
68,singapore,210936,[Help] Mother causing trouble at home,evd4gd,Corgibuttbutt,1580251477,86,13,"My mum didn't like my relative from dad's side. So everytime my dad come home, she would shout and scream while my dad quietly eats his dinner. This CNY, my mum devised a plan that would stop my dad from visiting them. She asked me to book a buffet on the CNY eve without asking my dad first. The relatives did not interact with my mum for years already. 

I don't know what dad told her but the plan obviously didn't work, he had plans on that day. Mum started raging and throwing everything at home. My dad's drawer with all the semi-important documents, my dad's badminton racket, heck, even the god altar outside my house. It didn't get my dad's attention still, so she started turning on all the electric switches at home before going to sleep. Lights in bathroom and kitchen, and even my sister's room (which is empty, she's married).

I'm not a fan of wasting electricity so every night i stayed up to off it. Then just before CNY, she found out that i have been turning off the lights and stuff. We got into a quarrel and followed up by a big fight. She started hitting my hand to stop me from switching off the light. We hit each other's hand and she ended up falling on the ground because as she was brandishing her arms, I smack her hand away. Dad woke up and told me to ignore mum, let her have her ways. Next day, she told me that she went to the hospital to get check up on her ""injuries"" (no bruises, no nothing). She claim that she can use it to sue me or send me to the police or something.

Recently she started threatening to throw my stuff instead, so i lock my room everytime I have to go to the toilet or school. I told dad to divorce as she contribute nothing to the family, but he keep emphasizing on forgiving her. At this rate, dad is going to have both his life and money drained.

My mum likes to gossip about her husband to her friends. Always telling her aunties that she's mistreated, other wife gets more pocket money, so on. (She's very overweight, well fed and there's no way anyone would believe that). She even cheated my dad 15k SGD to set up her clothing alteration shop in LRT. She promised that she would pay back when she makes money. (Setting up the shop did not cost anywhere near 15k) Later, she told dad that there's no way she's going to return that money as she deserve to have his money. She's always saying how my dad's CPF belongs to her and when dad die, she will have them, rightfully.

I need legal advices or just any advices on what I should do, as their child. I'm trying not to let this affect my studies but, it did. Thinking of seeking police's help but can they help?

77,singapore,237002,A discussion on advocacy and activism in Singapore,gofcww,Bryanlegend,1590135524,110,1,"I am writing this as a current Social Work student, and this piece is wholly my opinion. This also serves as a discussion piece for those of you interested in this topic to leave any relevant comments, and I will try my best to engage constructively. I will not provide a TL;DR version as it is best to read this in full if you want to fully understand what I am trying to say.

For those of you familiar with Social Work, one of the core values of the Social Work profession, as defined in the Code of Professional Ethics, is Social Justice. Advocacy and activism is also defined as key concepts in Social Work to achieve social justice and people empowerment. However, in Singapore’s context, and especially among peers and educators in the Social Work field, I feel that activism/advocacy has always been the elephant in the room. While many Social Workers here can empathise with the plights of those who actively seek to invoke change through advocacy/activism, very few are inclined to trod down the same path, as such actions are often seen as taboo or socially unacceptable, and often does not bode well in terms of career prospects.

Both advocacy and activism against the current status quo have always been actively discouraged in Singapore’s context, and some activists like Jolovan Wham and Kirsten Han sometimes run afoul of the law while trying to promote certain social changes. Other activists/advocates might not run afoul of the law, but are still often vilified by mainstream media or pro-incumbent commentators as agitators working against national interests, or simply just do-gooders with scant regard of national unity in times of crises. This is especially eminent in the context of COVID-19, where migrant workers rights have been extensively discussed. However, this can also refer to long-standing activism in other areas, including LGBT rights and free speech advocates (most notably those against POFMA)

I’m writing this piece because I have grown increasingly frustrated with the narrative that social activist/advocates are people who are ungrateful and who choose to only focus on the negatives. It is akin to saying healthcare workers are pessimists for monitoring and focusing on the debilitating symptoms of patients. Social Workers exist to bring about changes in marginalised sectors in the community to the best of their abilities. It is their job to identify discriminatory or negative traits of society and to bring them to light in order to remedy them. It is blatant disrespect to assume that activism (i.e. civil disobedience etc) is their first course of action when it is very likely to be their last resort, after negotiation and communications with relevant authorities have failed over a period of time.

However, my quip is not solely with people who oppose any change to the status quo with all their vehement fervour, or who openly deride such activists/advocates.

Certain people who are conservative in some religious groups will always be against LGBT rights. Certain people with business and political interests will always cite the trade-offs between migrant worker safety and economic viability, and if forced to choose one, will choose one. Certain people (and governments!) who value a paternalistic stance on collective security will never view free speech in a positive light.

What really irks me is how the seemingly average and moderate Singaporean remains critical of activism and advocacy, despite them being sympathetic to the various causes. In my many conversations with friends and family (or even strangers online) regarding said topics, they invariably follow the same vein of thought. 

“Oh I support LGBT rights, I just don’t think they should make such a huge fuss about 377A because it’s not enforced, and besides we just need to wait until society is less conservative and more ready. No point for conflict now and no point to go protest at Pink Dot.”

“Oh I absolutely agree that there should transparency and accountability in migrant worker issues. We definitely need to do more for them. It’s just that this is not the right time to discuss it when everyone is busy working on it and since it’s such a huge national crisis we cannot be divisive. Maybe when this is all over we can come back and relook this topic.”

“Oh yeah I don’t think POFMA is a good idea. But I think people should just follow and not challenge it at all. If there’s anything wrong they can just go to the courts or appeal against it, and time will tell if they are right”

“Oh yeah our nurses are being paid quite lowly and some of them are angry that they are valued less than swabbers, but we need swabbers urgently, so let’s just talk about nurse wages another time and focus at the thing at hand.”

Realise the one thing in common? It’s always about waiting for the right time, for the right environment, but no one can put it at a definitive date, and we are all expected to just go along with it.

I understand Singapore cannot change overnight. We cannot suddenly become kinder, less racially divisive, and less discriminatory of certain minority groups. But we cannot continue to be enablers of injustices as well, however passive that might be, however socially convenient it might be to do so. 

In Martin Luther King’s words, justice delayed is justice denied. I leave an excerpt of his Letter from a Birmingham Jail, in which he addressed white moderates who seemingly agree with his aims, but not his actions. I feel this is especially relevant in virtually all struggles minorities and persecuted members of societies face today, and not just in Singapore.

(“First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;"" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.”)

I will admit, I myself have been a passive enabler on many occasions, choosing to be civil and going with the flow rather than proactively seeking change. But as I look at protests and civil disobediences throughout the world, something frightens me as a prospective Social Worker. I look at how police brutality is rampant in Hong Kong protests, and yet there are people clamouring for peace and for protestors to just pack it up for the sake of economic stability. I look at how students with no political or protest experiences are thrusted into the fray overnight, for simply standing up to the values they believe in and have been taught their entire lives. I look at how ordinary citizens are arrested and beaten up, simply for refusing to give up their hard earned right to protest against what they perceive to be an unjust system.

While I am thankful that there is no basis for such violence and malignancy in Singapore, there remains a small part of my conscience nibbling at me. What if one day, the Singapore I fight for is no longer the Singapore I know? What if one day, as a Social Worker, one of the causes I am so passionate in becomes taboo to speak about? Do I remain civil and back down? Or is there something in this world worth fighting for, and worth standing up for, even if the consequences placed upon me by the state or authorities would be severe? Would I have to dissent according to my best and most genuine intentions or should I reluctantly acquiesce for the sake of civility, and become the very same “moderate” that enabled the injustice I had worked so hard to prevent all these years?

Already, dissent is strongly frowned upon here. I read with great disappointment that the simple act of holding a cardboard with a smiley face can be considered a violation of the Public Order Act and is liable for police investigation. 

You might say, it’s his problem for choosing to support climate justice activists, for not following the law against public assembly, for doing it despite being already placed in the public spotlight.

But think about it, what if one day the thing you so strongly believes in becomes a criminal offence, or something socially unacceptable? What if you have to forgo your dignity to the profession and calling you undertook or the values that have defined you as an unique human being?

The people on the right side today are often on the wrong side in history. Change often comes at the expense of the status quo. Let’s be kinder and less critical of people who spend their lives fighting what they perceive to be an unjust system. I am not saying you should join and support them at all costs, but at the very least, understand where they are coming from.

81,singapore,235817,I(18 M) cannot communicate with my mother anymore. I do not know what to do.,gkut30,RichLWJ,1589636334,27,1,"I come from a single parent family and I wish it is not. I really do not know what to do, I feel like crap everyday because my mother has been really bad to my entire family. My dad is a Singaporean and mom is from China but is now a Singaporean citizen. They married each other after only knowing each other for a year and a half. After marrying, she had my brother, then me, who is a year younger.

I remember when I was in kindergarten my dad and mom were still together, from what I can remember as a child they were okay to each other when I was in kindergarten. However, my mom brought both my older brother and I to watch movies and go outing with this guy (Person A) who isn’t my dad, who claims to be her “friend”. I was young back then thus I didn’t know anything. I do not remember anything else in kindergarten as it was too long ago. A few years had passed and I’m in primary school. My parents have been arguing a lot more and they started fighting. I do not know if it’s true but from what I can remember, my mom started hitting my father first, when my father tried to defend himself, accidentally pushed a thing people used to hang their clothes, and scratched her. I can still clearly hear it in my head, my mother shouting in Chinese “你是什么男人打女人” which roughly translates to “what kind of a guy are you to hit a girl”. I vaguely remember my dad as a “nice” guy, very calm and will think before he acts. I really do not know who started the fight first. During p3ish period, I can remember clearly that my dad asked me if my mom has been out with other guys. I don’t know how to answer so I just said yes. Apparently this lead to them having a divorce. I am really tired... When they divorced, I wasn’t even told about it. They divorced during my p6 period and I won’t say it affected my results for PSLE, so I’d say I was just really stupid. After divorced, I rarely see my dad and thus leading to me asking my mom. My mom said that my dad has a mistress, and doesn’t have time for us. Bear in mind this was in primary 6 when she told me this, I don’t know shit about marriage and shit when my mom told me to choose my dad or her. When I told her I don’t want this family to be broken, she scolded me for it. She keeps telling me my dad doesn’t want me at all and wants no contact with me. My brother and I had no choice in other words. My brother is a year older than me. He took his PSLE and got 10 marks higher than me. My mom always think I am the “smarter” one. When I got 10 marks lower than my brother she “said” it was fine and all because you tried, just work hard in the future. I blamed myself for not doing well but the past cant be changed. Around this period, my mom told me that my dad does not even care about us anymore, not giving the fees where the guy is supposed to give to the girl. My dad was earning 2-3k a month during that time. My mom however was earning WAYY more because of something that I am not comfortable saying. She always says how useless is my dad, saying how he only earns that amount of money. After my results collection for PSLE, my dad still arranges Sunday catch ups with him. My mom will then tell both of us to ask him for money. I know my dad is supposed to give money to support us but I really do not know anything. My mom usually tells and show us about my dad and his girlfriend to keep reminding us we were not wanted. My dad is honestly shit. After a few weeks of catching up on sundays, we stopped. I do not know what happened but he stopped.
During secondary school period, I was determined to do well and not be shit, but I always missed having a complete family. I remember during sec 1 buying of uniform, my classmate’s dad helped me to choose. I felt like shit. People have been encouraging me about single parent family and I know it is normal most children come from a single parent family. During secondary school my mom became more violent and “abusive” shouting words like go die, get out of the house and never come back to my brother and I when we were in the fault. During secondary 1-2 period, having a smartphone was a “must have” for everyone because “everyone has it”. When someone doesn’t have it people will judge. My mom didn’t allow my brother or I to have one during sec 1-2, so I would save up using my allowance to buy one. Once I got caught she would smash it and shout at my brother or I. When we told her that other classmates all have a smartphone she says this “then go to other peoples house and live”. I would say she usually scold us/beats us at least once a week. I remember when she used to scold us for hiding test papers/ playing games without her permission, she would scold the hell out us. She at times told us to get out of the house, when we tried to argue back. I remember after a few hours or so, she would tell my grandma, her mother to come find us. My grandma usually lives with us to help ease my moms labour. We used to have maids during kindergarten but my mom always scolded them and stuff, therefore not having one after secondary sch. During secondary 2 or 3, it all kind of changed when she introduced her “friend”, person A to us as her boyfriend. She became nice and all and person A was very nice to us. Person A really thought of us a lot and treat us like his own. I am definitely grateful. He calmed my mother down when she was about to scold and hit us, and he talked with my mother on how to “treat” us, by using brains and not brute force. We naturally became better , however we do make mistakes here and there. During one instance, my brother had a fight with my mother, and person A came to help my mother. Person A smashed all the devices my brother owned and “beat” him. My brother then said that he wasn’t even our dad, he has no rights to “punish” us. My brother is really a fucking dumb ass when he said that. I know better to not say that and suck it up when he “punished” me when I was wrong. This then lead to person A not being with my mom afterwards as my brother can not accept him. My mom then returned being “abusive” after a few months. She would scold/beat us when she feels like it, because of her job. She then worked as a tour guide, dealing with Chinese people. She would look down on them when they don’t buy souvenirs and stuff and scold them for it? After her work when I speak to her she would usually be angry and I would try not to agitate her. During this period, my grandma has already went back, so my brother and I tried and do everything we can, we would be lazy sometimes and skip housework and all. I think during sec 2 or 3, my mom finally could buy a hdb and so she did. My grandpa and grandma would come visit for a few months as my mom told them she got a house etc.. After a month, my mom had a very bad fight with my grandpa, her father, which lead to him straight away booking a ticket to fly back. My grandma would stay and take care of us again as our O levels are coming. My mom would start to raise her voice at her, her own mom, treating her like a “free” maid. After my brothers O level, he scored poorly and barely made it into poly. My mom essentially gave up on him and put all her hopes on me to perform well. After my O levels, I did better than my brother. I went to poly too but a different course. She says I can go poly but I must make it to uni. My mom always compares us to her friends child, saying how good they are, and not the bad ones. It is really tiring. She usually talks very loudly at home with her bunch of friends. After my O levels, my grandma went back. My brother and I would talk back to my mother when she is “unreasonable” but ultimately we would apologize. She always use the same old scolding, “go die, get out of MY house” and many more. My cousin, will then come to Singapore to study during my poly y1 period. My grandma would follow her and take care of her due to some reasons when her mom, my aunt and uncle is not available. She was “the smartest” out of the whole family, claiming it is really easy in Singapore. 
During my o levels, my mom would promise me to buy me stuff like a laptop, which she did buy for my brother and a bike, when I scored well during sec 2. This bike has never came and the laptop came as $2k cash after 1 year and a half. She does not keep up with her promises. I never really asked my mom for anything unlike my brother, always wanting good clothes etc. I am very sure my mom bought way more things for my brother than I but I never “complain” about it. I kinda know how hard to be the sole breadwinner for the family. My cousin after a semester in sec 2 failed most of her subjects. My mom used to always say to learn from ur little cousin, how good she is etc... It really is repetitive. I am just done.
Fast forward to this year, covid-19 occurred. This lead to my mom being jobless because of most flights being cancelled, so she went to find a job that can support us through this period. I helped her in every way possible, helping her translate most of her mails and helping her do her taxes, etc, the “adult”. I naturally complained since I have never been taught to do stuff like tax and other stuff like changing loan. I will then help her but at times tell her she was the one supposed to teach us how to do all these adult stuff. She would reply with “I give birth to u for what? Helping me only”. I feel like she is really unreasonable. Every time I taught her how to print/do those stuff, she would say she learnt already but will then come back to me to ask me how to do the exact same thing. I naturally still taught her again, although with some complains. She don’t ask my brother as she knows my brother would not help her, or only helps her when he likes to. She earns way lesser now as compared to pre covid-19, leading to her being more frustrated. For this entire period during covid, she has been really “angry” and raises her voice at everybody. Today, my mom came back from work, when she asked my brother to help pass her a snack, my brother however, did not want to, so he does not. My mom would start scolding about how garbage we were and is caused by our grandma being too nice to us. This is not related to my grandma at all and she somehow managed to drag her in. My mom then started raising her voice, in my opinion, scolded her mom. I couldn’t take her always scolding my grandma and treating her like how she treated past maids so I told her to not scold her mom. She became furious and shouted at me that she can do whatever she wants, this is her house, the usual. I then replied at least don’t shout and raise your voice to your own mother. She used to always raise her voice to my grandma. My mom then argued with me for 30 mins, when I asked her politely to not raise her voice at her mother. I then shouted back replying how she was “unreasonable” and how she should not raise her voice and scold her own mother. She thinks she’s always right and she thinks we hate her etc.. I just wanted to try and talk things out with her every time but it always leads to her scolding me, so today I shouted back at her, telling her if it was right to shout at her own mother. She then replied saying she never did. Hahaha. As if she never did. I then talked back to her saying how she mistreated her own mom. She told me to go die, get out of her house and she says I do what I want. Wtf is that logic? I am trying to talk things out with her at first but she keep bringing up stuff like “your dad doesn’t even want u”, “it’s not my responsibility to take care of u”, “go die and my life would be easier” and “get out of my house”. I just really can’t handle it anymore. She’s so unreasonable and she thinks of herself as god and think she is always right. I respect her a lot but I really cannot come to things with her. I never contacted my dad for very long, he only messages us once a year on our birthday, so I have not contacted him. I feel bad for my grandma, which she has to stay here and constantly get shouted at by her own daughter.


Sorry for my rant. I really really feel bad. I know I am not perfect, I make mistakes but I at least acknowledge my mistakes and try to be better, on the other hand, my mom never thinks she’s wrong. I just don’t know what to do. Maybe I should really just die like how she always says and fulfill her “wish”. I never really told my close friends about this situations over the years as I feel it is not necessary and they cannot really help other then comforting me which I am grateful for. What should I do? I think I really have a problem. I have not went to any therapy as my mom would just not go as she never thinks she is wrong. She expects me to apologize every time and I feel like shit as I am really tired now. I just don’t know what to do. I apologize for any spelling or grammatical error in this post. I am feeling really tired. This post is really bad and doesn’t include many other situations, I’m sorry for not including other things. I am really tired already..

I am asking this because I am wondering whether the rich are benefiting more from the crisis compared to the poor and vulnerable.

For example, are the REIT investors still trying to maintain their returns while their property managers reluctantly pass down their property tax waivers? Is means-testing working - why should we require people to apply for an extra $500 when the money could just be distributed instead? Admittedly some expenditures cannot be given out as money (or example virus testing, increasing healthcare capacity, relocating migrant workers and enforcing safe-distancing measures), but how many per cent of the budget are these?

&lt;Scaling up our Testing Capabilities&gt;

Testing is a critical enabler of our fight against COVID-19. That’s why we have been steadily building up our national testing capacity.

From an average of 2,900 tests per day in early April, we are now able to conduct more than 8,000 tests per day. To date, Singapore has tested about 2,100 per 100,000 persons. In comparison, the US has tested 1,600 per 100,000 and the UK 1,000 per 100,000. The higher intensity of testing allows us to pick up more cases.

In our migrant worker dormitories, for example, we have been testing around 3000 workers every day (including the workers that are asymptomatic), and will continue to do more tests. So far, more than 21,000 migrant workers living in dormitories have been tested. This means that we have tested about 1 in 15 workers in dormitories (or 6,500 per 100,000), far higher than the testing rates seen in countries like South Korea (one in 90, or 1,100 per 100,000).

One urgent priority is to test migrant workers who have moved out of the dormitories but are continuing to work in essential services. This is to reduce the risk of transmission in workplaces and to the wider community.

We are also doing more tests to protect vulnerable groups. For instance, we are testing the staff at nursing homes and senior residential homes, as well as healthcare workers and frontline officers.

As more testing capacity is brought on-stream, we will gradually expand testing to the wider pool of workers. This expanded testing regime is of critical importance in enabling us to safely resume economic activities beyond the circuit breaker period.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g92sdn/singapore_rams_up_testing_to_more_than_8000_tests/,0.0,"[""Some Good News on the testing side, from Ho Ching's Facebook Posts, it also seems that plans are in the works for drive by testing to be available for members of the people who wanted to be tested for a fee.

###The Pathway to Power

So far, my review has mostly left out one massive elephant in the room. Lee Kuan Yew was Prime Minister of Singapore from 1959 to 1990. When he stepped down from office, he went straight into a close advisory role, sticking around the government in some official capacity until 2011. How was he in power so long? What was his approach to opposition and to political disagreements, beyond lawsuits? Where did he fall on the scale of democratically elected leader to dictator?

As with every other topic, LKY is pretty candid about this all. The best place to start, though, is likely not with the overt political battles. Instead, I'll focus where he focused early: the unions.

######Unions

This section will dive into the weeds a bit more than most of my writing. It's for a good cause, I promise.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Singapore had, to put it bluntly, a union problem. Between July 1961 and September 1962, the country faced 153 strikes. In LKY's telling, most unions were under communist control, and all ""had turned combative,"" having learned from British trade unions ""all the bad habits and practices of how to squeeze employers for more pay and benefits regardless of the consequences to the company."" ^\(83)

So Lee Kuan Yew, ardent reactionary that he was, tore unions down, stripped protections and regulations away, and ushered in a new and gloriously productive era of unfettered capitalism.

Those of you who've followed this review so far won't be surprised to hear that's just about exactly *not* what happened. This chapter came early in the book, and it's where LKY's personal story started becoming really, really interesting to me. Why? Well, it's when he casually mentioned his political experience before becoming Prime Minister:

He was a legal advisor and negotiator, fighting on behalf of trade and student unions (and, unrelated to our current focus but fun to note, moonlighting as a [free speech defender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew#Fajar_trial) when a university socialist club published a ""seditious"" article). You might remember the quote from part one of my review, when a Labour party leader emphasized how committed a socialist LKY was. What did that mean when he took charge and faced trouble with unions? As he was urging unions to abandon some destructive practices, he was facing down against policies he was responsible for, protections he had fought for when his country's workers were being exploited, but that were damaging his country enough he regretted his decision.

He cites as an example triple pay on public holidays, which ""led to cleansing workers deliberately allowing garbage to accumulate before public holidays to ensure that they would have to work on these holidays."" ^\(84) Elsewhere, he cites the trouble of employers investing in expensive machinery to minimize need for workers, leading to ""a small group of privileged unionized workers getting high pay and a growing band of underpaid and underemployed workers."" ^\(84) With these and related concerns in mind, he went in 1966 to a meeting of union leaders from around Asia, asked them not to ""kill the goose whose golden eggs [they] needed,"" ^\(84) and got to work encouraging changes like pay for performance over time on job.

Union leaders objected. He pushed forward, but ""took care to meet the union leaders privately to explain [his] worries... [in] off-the-record meetings [to] make them understand why [he] had to get a new framework in place."" ^\(85) That actually worked for most. Step one, then: come up with a careful plan, explain it in private, draw support. Step two?

Well, it's Singapore. One ""irrational and ignorant"" ^\(85) union leader over cleaners and other daily-paid workers delivered an ultimatum asking for a pay raise and then called for some 2400 cleaning workers to strike. LKY ordered the dispute to arbitration to make the strike unlawful. When the union went on strike anyway, the police arrested the leader and 14 others. The union registrar issued notices of potential deregistration to the union. The ministry of health told the workers they had sacked themselves and could reapply for employment the next day.

And, the next day, ninety percent of the workers applied for reemployment, LKY had the support of the public, and union culture started to shift to a give-and-take. He went first to the union leaders, then to employers, urging cooperation and fairness, and emphasized that ""unless [they] made a U-turn from strikes and violence toward stability and economic growth, [they] would perish"" ^\(88).

On to step three. In 1968, Singapore passed comprehensive laws covering leave, bonuses, and other points of contention. In 1969, they had their first full year without strikes. In 1972, they established a council between union members, employers, and government to determine annual wage increases. LKY requested his colleague Devan Nair return to Singapore to lead the union congress, and under his lead union delegates decided to focus their attention on setting up co-ops in taxis, supermarkets, insurance, and afterwards a strikingly broad array of industries.

The whole thing, at least in LKY's telling, was a spiraling and mutually beneficial arrangement. As union leaders got experience directing co-ops, they gained greater appreciation for the role of good management. To help ""reduce the feeling that workers belonged to a lower order,"" ^\(91) the government subsidized union land purchases for clubs, resorts, and other facilities. To nurture talent, the unions set up a labor college per LKY's urging, and he encouraged talented students returning from overseas to work in the unions and strengthen them.

Why do I emphasize this in so much detail? Primarily to underscore this quote:

&gt; Strict laws and tough talk alone could not have achieved this. It was our overall policy that convinced our workers and union leaders... but ultimately it was the trust and confidence they had in me, gained over long years of association, that helped transform industrial relations from one of militancy and confrontation to cooperation and partnership. ^\(88)

And later, this reminder of his guiding ethos as he discusses the checks and balances of unions:

&gt; The key to peace and harmony in society is a sense of fair play, that everyone has a share in the fruits of our progress. ^\(93)

As in tensions around race and language, as he approached the unions Lee Kuan Yew balanced strict, hard policy with the reassurance that he understood his people and wanted to help them--and, we Westerners don't fail to note, a side of authoritarianism. Reason and careful negotiation for most, coordinated and overwhelming force when negotiation breaks down, and pragmatic, prosperity-centered policy in the aftermath. It's a pattern you can see again and again. This pattern is one major reason to focus on the unions. The other is that both LKY and his greatest early rivals had their roots in that movement. 

######Communists

**I:**

*Disclaimer: I am entirely unqualified to provide a thorough, balanced account of Lee Kuan Yew's rise and the controversies in Singapore's early history. My intent here is to present the story largely as LKY writes it. For other sides of the story, consider [this BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33621862), [Wikipedia on the opposition Barisan Sosialis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barisan_Sosialis), biographies of those LKY names as communists in his book: [1](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1462_2009-02-18.html) [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chia_Thye_Poh) [3](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_706_2005-01-12.html) [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eu_Chooi_Yip) [5](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2013-07-12_103126.html), a couple of reddit threads [1](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/8bd584/more_130_academics_sign_open_letter_in_support_of/) [2](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9hdi7g/select_committee_on_fake_news_historian_pj_thum/) [3](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9hdi7g/select_committee_on_fake_news_historian_pj_thum/) plus a [journal article](https://brill.com/view/journals/jco/7/2/article-p211_6.xml)^[Scihub](http://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1163/179325411X595413) if you're feeling particularly ambitious. tl;dr: There was definitely strong communist influence in Singapore; some LKY accuses of being communists vehemently deny it and likely shouldn't be considered communist; even these non-communist leftists were heavily influenced by Mao and the Cultural Revolution.* 

Here's an understatement for you: Lee Kuan Yew was not fond of communism. Understandable, given that China went through the full sweep of the Cultural Revolution as he rose into influence. Throughout his book, he speaks of communists with a fascinating mix of fear and respect.

In his telling, the early history of post-colonial Singapore is framed almost entirely as a struggle between his People's Action Party (PAP) and communists. In the 1950s, there was a sort of uneasy alliance between LKY's moderate wing of the PAP, a left wing headed by [Lim Ching Siong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lim_Chin_Siong), and the underground communist organizations in place in Singapore, all eager for independence from Britain. As soon as the PAP became the majority party in 1959, though, that alliance splintered. By 1961, the PAP expelled its left wing (13 of its 39 members), which became the Barisan Sosialis. That's where the real fun began.

If you ask the Barisan, they were non-communist leftists. If you ask LKY, they were a front organization for communism. He takes evident delight throughout a chapter of his book outlining the rise and collapse of their party. The government was contested through the 60s, in and out of an attempted union with Malaysia. In 1968, though, the Barisan declared Singaporean elections illegitimate and refused to participate, electing instead to take inspiration from Mao and call the people of Singapore to ""smash all the trammels that bind them and rush forward along the road to liberation"" ([Cheng 226](http://sci-hub.tw/https://doi.org/10.1163/179325411X595413)). The people did not smash the trammels. Instead, the Barisan left the PAP virtually unopposed, granting it uncontested control of the government, and faded quickly from relevance. LKY mentions that it was this ""costly mistake... [that] gave the PAP unchallenged dominance of Parliament for the next 30 years."" ^\(110)

From there, as he tells it, communist influence shifted into terrorist attacks and bombings during the 70s and a relentless ""hardcore following of some 20 to 30 percent of the electorate"" ^\(111), as Maoist organization worked throughout the Chinese-speaking part of Singapore. LKY rushes through this, preferring to more specifically outline the falls of several of their leaders (and a few overt communists). Each spent years to decades in jail or exile, only permitted to reenter Singapore upon cutting links with the party and disclosing all past activity.

That may be too passive. Put more bluntly: LKY [tossed them in jail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Coldstore), with British approval but without trial, and makes no secret of having done so. He is *extremely open* about his willingness to take whatever measures necessary to stop communism. His description of their conflicts sounds, simply, like an all-out war:

&gt; We learned not to give hostages to our adversaries or they would have destroyed us. ^\(112)

And:

&gt; Could we have defeated them if we had allowed them habeas corpus and abjured the powers of detention without trial? I doubt it. Nobody dared speak out against them, let alone in open court. ^\(113)

And:

&gt; They were formidable opponents. We had to be as resolute and unyielding in this contest of wills. ...Their ability to penetrate an organization with a cadre of influential activists and take control of it was fearsome. ^\(114)

And:

&gt; Despite ruthless methods where the ends justified the means, the communists failed, but not before destroying many who stood up against them, and others who after joining them decided that their cause was mistaken. ^\(119)

From 1963 to 1989, Singapore detained some 690 people, often holding them for years without trial. They required any political actors to affiliate with parties explicitly to ""force [communists] out into the open and make them easy to monitor"" ^\(115). LKY spoke of the impossibility of progress while ""communists retained their baleful influence"" ^\(108). In short, he did everything he possibly could to stamp communism and Maoist influence out of Singapore. Your level of comfort with these decisions will likely depend either on your opinion of communism or your commitment to free expression. Charitably, LKY saw the horrors of the Cultural Revolution and determined to stop it within his sphere. Uncharitably, he saw an opportunity to destroy his opposition and take absolute power, and he took it.

For me, though, far more compelling than his opposition to communism was his commitment to learn from their methods.

**II:**

See, even while LKY lays out his fight against communism, you hear fascinating hints of respect in his descriptions of them. He describes how the PAP, when they took office, were ""sickened by the greed, corruption, and decadence of many Asian leaders"" ^\(157), and how a similar disgust led Chinese-school students in Singapore to support communism. They ""saw the communists as exemplars of dedication, sacrifice, and selflessness, the revolutionary virtues displayed in the spartan lives of the Chinese communist leaders."" ^\(157) Later, when describing his conviction that ""candidates must not need large sums of money to get elected"" ^\(164), he again cites communists, pointing out that they didn't use money to win votes.

Much earlier, when discussing his own need for security, he mentions that while ""threats from racial fanatics [were] unpredictable... the communists were rational and calculating and would see no benefit in [attacking his family]"" ^\(5). And return to his description of communists failing. He mentions ""the skillful and tough methods of the unyielding communists... were unforgettable lessons in political infighting."" ^\(112) When dismissively comparing a later opponent to them, he mentions they were ""formidable adversaries... serious men, committed to their cause."" ^\(125)

Why am I harping so much on this point? Well, much has been made of Singapore's near&amp;ndash;one-party system. From a two-party system like the USA, or the multi-party systems in much of the rest of the developed world, it's hard to picture a setting where one party wins every election, time in and time out, without assuming corruption. Lee Kuan Yew provides an explanation for it, and as with many of his lessons in the groundwork of politics, it comes straight from his encounters with the communists. This next quote is pretty long, but I'm sharing it in full because it strikes me as one of the most important insights LKY provides, one that is relevant for every ideological movement:

&gt; We had learned from our toughest adversaries, the communists. Present-day opposition leaders go on walkabouts to decide where they will do well, based on the way people respond to them at hawker centers, coffee shops, food courts, and supermarkets, and whether people accept the pamphlets they hand out. I have never believed this. **From many unhappy encounters with my communist opponents, I learned that while overall sentiment and mood do matter, the crucial factors are institutional and organizational networks to muster support.** When we went into communist-dominated areas, we found ourselves frozen out. Key players in a constituency, including union leaders and officials of retailers' and hawkers' associations, and clan and alumni organizations, would all have been brought into a network by communist activists and made to feel part of a winning team. We could make little headway against them however hard we tried during elections. **The only way we could counter their grip of the ground was to work on that same ground for years between elections.**

I emphasize this quote so strongly because it speaks directly to my own frustrations with ideologies. Anyone who steps away from an ideology because they believe something in it is untrue will almost inevitably notice, and grow frustrated, with just how many people brush off those same untruths. Lee Kuan Yew doesn't present a new concept here, but he articulates it clearly and directly: Absolute truth is mostly disconnected from success. Organized ideas thrive; scattered ideas fail. People need rallying flags. They lunge for teams. Truth matters a bit, yes, but much more importantly, *what are you doing for people?* Good organization beats a good idea every time. 

If you want the best ideas to win, *organize for them.*

Did Lee Kuan Yew have good policy ideas? From my angle, yes. There's nothing remarkable about that, though. Plenty of people have those ideas. What truly sets him apart as a figure worth studying, in my eyes, is not just the quality of his ideas but the way he combines them with a depth of understanding of institutions and power.

And in part, he had his deepest adversaries, the communists, to thank for it.

So how did he do it? Why, 60 years later, does the PAP still hold 83 of 89 seats in Singapore's parliament?

######Staying in power

**I.**

&gt; After winning all the seats, I set out to widen our support in order to straddle as broad a middle ground as possible. I intended to leave the opposition only the extreme left and right. We had to be careful not to abuse the absolute power we had been given. I was sure that if we remained honest and kept faith with the people, we would be able to carry them with us, however tough and unpalatable our policies. ^\(111)

&gt; Our critics believed we stayed in power because we have been hard on our opponents. This is simplistic. If we had betrayed the people's trust, we would have been rejected. ^\(121)

What do you do, as a new political party struggling to gain a foothold, then an abruptly dominant force, to get the trust of everyday citizens? How do you organize?

One tool LKY used was the People's Association (PA). He intended the association to be a hub, not just of political activity, but of useful community resources in general: literacy classes, technology instruction, cooking courses, so forth. To aid in this, he invited influential community members from ""clan associations, chambers of commerce, recreational clubs, and arts, leisure, and social activity groups"" ^\(122), and set up more than a hundred community centers throughout Singapore.

Next came the ""welcoming"" and ""goodwill"" committees--activists in local communities called up to discuss things like road improvements, street lights, and drains on the one hand, delicate race relations on the other. Successful and eager members of these turned into leadership for community centers and ""citizens' consultative committees"" who received funds to provide public works, welfare grants, and scholarships.

None of these institutions were explicitly partisan. They were aimed at the maintenance tasks of community life, the uncontroversial but useful background structures. LKY mentions that many wanted to avoid active association with political parties, largely as a holdover from colonial times and threats of retribution. These institutions allowed the government to work with ""elders who were respected in their own communities"" ^\(123), making it easier to reach out to people at all levels. Recall the time LKY worked with Malaysian community leaders to create plans for education--this structure was the means by which he managed it.

Add government housing to this (with its own ""residents' committees"", and you begin to see the strength of this soft power: layers and layers of semi-political community figures, helping people day-to-day, working alongside the People's Action Party even when not directly affiliated with them. As LKY puts it, ""Opposition leaders on walkabouts go through well-tended PAP ground."" ^\(123) He credits his own political strength to public speaking skill, which he took advantage of in an annual unscripted address in Malay, Hokkien Chinese, Mandarin, and English, and in rallies around the country.

Voting another party into power, then, would mean in part needing to figure out a whole new system of organization at all levels. The PAP wasn't shy about using this sort of advantage, either. LKY rather proudly mentions one election where they promised priority public housing upgrades for constituencies that voted more strongly for the PAP, then follows it up with one of those lines that could only come from him:

&gt; *This was criticized by American liberals as unfair, as if pork barrel politics did not exist elsewhere.*

Honest. To a fault.

Viable opposition came in a few districts, eventually. That, too, he aimed to turn to his advantage. He spends time on one opponent voted into one precinct in 1981, a ""sound and fury"" ^\(124) demagogue who took mostly opportunistic stands and who ""probably kept better opponents out"" ^\(125). Realizing that some MPs hadn't ever faced serious opposition, LKY says, he ""decided he was useful as a sparring partner"" ^\(125). There's a great moment, too, when he mentions a ""shrewder"" opponent who apparently reflected the population better by saying the PAP was doing well, but ""could do better and should listen more to criticism."" ^\(125) In response, the PAP was respectful, aiming to encourage ""nonsubversive opposition.""

**II.**

As much as my American instincts lead me to look at this all and want to talk about how controlling and oppressive the idea of this sort of single-party rule is, I find it difficult to do so without proving too much. The US, after all, has two major political parties and a bunch of nearly inconsequential competitors, choked out by organization and history and election rules. On Singapore's scale, one-party leadership isn't unusual here. My home state of Utah has voted for the Republican party since 1968. Chicago, only a little smaller than Singapore, has been under one party since 1927. Organizing, providing services to encourage people to keep them around, criticizing opposition, and promising to help those who support them sounds like, well, every political party on the planet. And when measuring corruption, Singapore [compares rather favorably](https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/corruption-index) to the US--and, well, almost anywhere else.

Take one element LKY focuses on: money and special interests in politics. Singapore made voting compulsory in 1959 and has enforced [strict spending limits](https://www.gov.sg/factually/content/are-there-limits-to-how-much-a-party-can-spend-on-election-campaigns) in elections throughout the PAP's time as majority party. LKY mentions that neither communists, nor the PAP, nor opposing parties have ever spent much money to win elections. In 2015, the PAP spent [$5.3 million](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/ge2015-spending-pap-candidates-spent-53m-while-the-eight-opposition-parties-expenses) between 89 general election candidates. Sticking with Chicago as a point of comparison, their most recent mayoral elections saw [a single candidate](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/3/29/18430218/chicago-mayoral-money-tracker-preckwinkle-beats-lightfoot-in-final-money-chase) raise more.

LKY is dismissive as well of the idea of anchoring ministerial salaries low. He explains: ""Singapore will remain clean and honest only if honest and able men are willing to fight elections and assume office. They must be paid a wage commensurate with that men of their ability and integrity are earning for managing a big corporation or a sucessful legal or other professional practice."" ^\(166) He points out with distaste the ""revolving door"" system in the US, where high-paid private sector workers are appointed to posts by the president, then return to the private sector with ""enhanced value"". Part of avoiding this was the decision to remove most perks and allowances and provide benefits as lump sums. The rest was a gradual process: freezing ministerial wages until 1970, then raising them from S$2,500 to S$4,500 monthly while his own was ""fixed at S$3,500 to remind the public service that some restraint was still necessary."" ^\(168) In 1995, after periodically raising wages, Singapore fixed salaries of senior public officials at two-thirds of their private sector equivalents. 

Despite this relative high pay, he shares several stories of times he persuaded people to take salary cuts for government work: a bank GM making S$950,000 per year who he persuaded to become minister of state at a third that salary; a chief justice who went from making S$2 million a year as a banker to S$300,000 in the court, who according to LKY ""accepted [the] offer out of a sense of duty"" ^\(218).



**III.**

Most interesting, for me, is how LKY closes his chapter on maintaining control in the political system:

&gt; **Will the political system that my colleagues and I developed work more or less unchanged for another generation? I doubt it.** Technology and globalization are changing the way people work and live. ...Will the PAP continue to dominate Singapore's politics? How big a challenge will a democratic opposition pose in the future? **This will depend on how PAP leaders respond to changes in the needs and aspirations of a better-educated people, and to their desire for greater participation in decisions that shape their lives.** Singapore's options are not that numerous that there will be unbridgeable differences between differing political views in working out solutions to our problems. \(134)

I get the sense that in aiming to maintain power, as in all else, LKY was a pragmatist. He did not aim to set up a dynasty that lasted generations or seek to obtain glory at all costs. He found a system that suited his country's needs at the time and put it in place, anticipating that Singapore would change as it needed to. Make no mistake: he wielded near-absolute power, and he knew it. But he did not abuse it.

###Conclusion

One last question remains to be answered, not about Lee Kuan Yew, but about this review:

Why have I spent 12,000 words and the better part of a month poring over the policy of a tiny country of five million, and a leader who hasn't formally been in charge since 1990? What's my agenda?

Put simply, I think it's worth paying attention to. Not the specifics of the policy, so much: Singapore is a unique country, and solutions adapted to its culture and position are unlikely to translate perfectly to other environments. More than that, I am fascinated by the way LKY's approach cleaves at right angles the modern Western political landscape. Three points stood out from Lee Kuan Yew's achievement in Singapore:

1. It was not inevitable. It's easy to frame things like this in retrospect as certainties of history, but I honestly think that's the wrong view of Singapore. It came close to collapsing in the 60s, and while it used its unique advantages as a port city to the full, LKY took it where he did with a series of careful, rational decisions. Policy specifics like welfare and health care, measured approaches to racial and political tensions, and the others detailed through the book could have gone a myriad of other ways under different leadership, resulting in a very different city even if it still developed. His political power came because he organized and planned for it.

2. It was not evil. Growing up, I knew little about Singapore, but what I heard could be summed up as ""clean place, pretty developed, freaky authoritarian, canes people, bans chewing gum."" I've heard it referred to as ""China lite"" and generally seen, if not outright dismissal, at least heavy skepticism. I think some of that is unwarranted. Lee Kuan Yew had some 50 years in a position of influence to show his true colors, and from what I can see seems to have spent that time sincerely and single-mindedly focused on his country's welfare. Don't get me wrong, his approach has flaws and clearly doesn't align fully with US values, but I cannot find more to object to in his politics than in any other politician's.

3. It was not reactionary. I said this before and deliberately emphasize it again. Lee Kuan Yew was not looking to the past and pushing against social change. He stood at the vanguard of his country's growth, mixing traditionally progressive and traditionally conservative ideas in surprising ways. One of the most consistent of LKY's messages was a focus on the future: short-term sacrifices for long-term gain, relentlessly pushing to apply new ideas and change his approach rather than seeking to preserve or return to the past. Framing it as reactionary instead of pragmatic leads to poor predictions and a distorted view.

We focus on political issues through the lens of our own culture. For Americans like me, that means viewing things in terms of constitutional rights, red and blue states with their increasing cultural divide, and confidence that we are positioned neatly at the center of the world. I enjoy looking at Singapore both to see when its challenges and responses mirror US ones and to notice where they diverge. For someone like me, dissatisfied with political systems close to home, not fitting cleanly into any local political subculture, feeling disenfranchised, it serves as both an example and an admonishment. 

As an example, it is more personal. Lee Kuan Yew is one of the first politicians I've found who almost always discusses and solves problems in a way that makes sense to me and aligns with my ideals. While there are meaningful criticisms to aim towards him, I am mostly not the one to make them. I admire him and believe the world would benefit if more political movements shared his level-headed approach to difficult problems. If the US had a political party with principles similar to LKY's, I would join.

The admonishment, though, should speak to all who would like to see the world change somehow. I repeat it from above. The sheer frequency of people gaining power only to abuse it should warn against any notion that LKY gained and won influence because he was good or right. He gained influence because he understood influence, and his country was fortunate that he chose to use it for their good. Movements don't win influence because they are true or good. They win because they organize to fill people's needs. So what should you do if you want truth, effective policy, or your ideals to gain ground? Organize. Build structure. Help people. 

Thanks for sticking with me through this review! My notes can be found [here](https://pastebin.com/cUjSfRVm), for anybody who wants yet more and is curious about Singapore's military, banks, or other areas I didn't touch on. If you're interested in reading the book for yourself, particularly if you'd like to see the extensive foreign policy review that takes up the latter two-thirds or write a more scathing critique, I'd encourage you to [go pick it up](https://smile.amazon.com/Third-World-First-Singapore-1965-2000/dp/0060197765/). 

I'll close my review quoting Lee Kuan Yew one last time, this time the final paragraph of his book:

&gt; The future is as full of promise as it is fraught with uncertainty. ... That we have succeeded in the last three decades does not ensure our doing so in the future. However, we stand a better chance of not failing if we abide by the basic principles that have helped us progress: social cohesion through sharing the benefits of progress, equal opportunities for all, and meritocracy, with the best man or woman for the job, especially as leaders in government. ^\(691)

After the first incident, my mom and dad got into a huge fight over the fact and all of my siblings, including myself, are extremely angry at him. When the announcement was made that masks were compulsory, he was the first to flaunt the rules to us and warn us about the fines.

We figured, okay, maybe he got it through his thick skull that you shouldn't do that. Well I guess fucking not. Both times, the people who came over were his friends and they ended up just having small talk so it wasn't even anything remotely important to excuse breaking the rule.

My mom is a healthcare worker so she's incredibly stressed about the pandemic and stress can worsen her health problems. She's more or less ignoring the problem now as ""no matter how many times I confront him about something, he won't listen.""

Help and advice needed 😭,g6133x,Normo_Kloppo,1587562007,20,1,"So... the story starts like this: My girlfriend managed to obtain a really good internship award (high pay and prestige with overseas attachment included). Even with the Circuit-Breaker, she was hoping that the internship could still continue online with WFH. Unfortunately, she received a call from HR today that it got cancelled cos of COVID-19. I gave her some words of encouragement but it didn't really help cos she was inconsolable.

She was really upset, and I think her sadness spilled over to a little fight we got into. We were at the supermarket buying food and she I think she hinted that she wanted me to pay for her snacks cos she was upset and needed a gift (her language of love is gifting). However, I just didn't get the hint cos I am quite blur sometimes. My decision to let her pay for her own food triggered her anger. With her stress/sadness accumulated, she became really pissed at me.

She's pissed to the point that she even blocked me and issued a break-up call (she does this when she is really upset but after a while she cools down cos she is bipolar like that sometimes). Knowing the error of my ways, I later went to the supermarket to buy some snacks and left it at her door as she lives close-by.

Any advice from romantics and non-romantics alike? 

Also, any words of enlightenment/thoughts/prayers/suggestions would be helpful at this point.

&gt; This encapsulates how i felt like at Ground Zero today due the Bubble Tea Shops temporarily halting businesses during this Circuit Breaker period. As a Grabfood Rider, 8.45pm i received order to collect bubble tea from Blk 461 Yishun Ave 6, at that time, i was actually pretty far away near to Khatib MRT, was actually surprised ""wah! so far away get order there"", as soon as got closer, i noticed a whole stretch of vehicles and bicycles and PMDs and PABs. So there i was at Ground Zero.
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, It was the Liho Staff, They were overwhelmed with non-stop orders and no way to stop it from coming in. There were only 2 staffs working in that outlet and over 400 cups of orders + about 100 grabriders waiting there.. IF there ever was a time when keep social distance failed, it was there and then. (100+ riders confined to a pretty small space)
&gt; 
&gt; Secondly, GRAB itself (cannot speak for Deliveroo, but i heard Panda also has this same issue), they were uncontactable, the Liho staffs were trying to call in to GRAB hotline (majority of the riders there were grab riders) to tell them that they were truly overwhelmed and they couldn't get through to grab.
&gt; 
&gt; Thirdly, The Riders themselves looking for Rice Bowls (i am pretty sure the Waterway fight also is along this stance) our system is pretty bad actually, say, we have an order we couldn't complete, if we were to cancel it on our end, grab will not compensate us if we were to report it basically ""You cancelled, not our pasal"" However, if we were to call into grab and ask them to cancel on our behalf, we will be compensated for our time and effort, but, being uncontactable, most of us really have no choice but to cancel, some of us waited almost 2 hours for our orders and customers mostly refuse to cancel (mine was basically :teary eyed: please don't cancel, i don't mind waiting) but to no avail cause that outlet was beginning to run out of time and ingredients so they had to close their shop at 10.50pm. all other orders were rejected, i think over 80 of us didn't manage to get any orders complete, and since we can't contact grab, we basically forfeit our efforts there (2 hours waiting, no compensation)

Like the title says, I do know that it's absolutely necessary for this Circuit Breaker. I do know that  Covid-19 is a super tough SOB to fight. I do know that we have no choice because of many other reasons including people repeatedly flaunting the CB rules which partially caused this to extend in the 1st place.

I'm aware of the BBT ""last minute yolo party"" queue last night. While like many of the Singaporeans where I'm tempted to immediately scoff and jump in to criticize them, I thought for a while and decided to take a moment, and think through in regards to their situation, thoughts and feelings at that moment. 

Why do people seem to forgo all logic and common sense for something as trivial as a dumb cup of sugar, tea and boba? Why is it that we can still manage to stay home as much as we can but upon hearing about the non-essential F&amp;B ban, we lose all of our bearings and do ridiculous actions?

A lot of our lives have been disrupted out of the blue, with some of us handling it while others are breaking down entirely. You would see people doing funny stuff like using exercising as an excuse to go out, taking buses and intentionally going to far places, people using buying food as an excuse to go out etc. Does it sound stupid? Yes. But is it sad? Yes. Our lives have just been forcefully disrupted out of the sudden after all.

Also it's the 1st time that us as a nation, we had to observe such protocols in the longest time ever as a modern nation. Is this a #firstworldproblem ? Absolutely yes. 
But is it hard? Yes as well.

I'm pretty sure that many of us definitely have 1-2 snacks/comfort food of our liking/choice lying around at home such as loaves of bread, cakes, chips, crisps, soft drinks etc or whichever other sort of foods that you like during this period of CB. Now imagine having none of these for 1 month, and having to coop up at home + some of us facing personal issues or the aftermath of getting retrenched due to Covid-19. Would you be able to truly be alright, if this has been dealt to you on top of all the other stuff that has been handed to you?

In my humble opinion, food itself holds an important role even if we should be living to eat and not eating to live. Countless times in history have shown that food can make or break a nation/army. Food has been shown to be a mercy, comfort and deliverance for this harsh existence of our lives. Food has been made as our joy and blessing that we can afford to enjoy even in the toughest moments.

Thus, having thought all of these points made me feel sad and wanting to empathise with people instead of wanting to laugh/scoff/mock/scold them. It made me feel helpless about this pandemic as our hands are tied, yet we cannot do anything about it other than abiding by these extreme measures to combat this pandemic. It is all the more in such tough times that we as a nation should work together to support our brothers and sisters to overcome this together (yes, even the less bright ones). This saying is already overused and lame af but ""together we stand, divided we fall"" still holds true.

108,singapore,247124,"Apart from Opposition in Parliament, we need a PAP Reformation",hjtiul,thehydroash,1593679987,24,1,"Was thinking about this and thought of sharing it here. Feel free to share your views, I’m quite interested to hear it since we are all in the mood to discuss about the elections.

Firstly, I would like to say that the opposition have really been upping their game this time round. Lots of good candidates that are really giving a tough contest and I cant wait to see how it all unfolds on July 10. PAP will still probably sweep but some really interesting wards like Sengkang. And while we do need the Opposition in Parliament to prevent giving PAP a ‘blank cheque’, I think PAP really needs to review its processes and their commitment to provide for the people. 

There is no doubt that they have done so much for our country and they have exceptional politicians leading the nation. However, I do believe they only have themselves to blame for the rise in Opposition supporters. My opinion is that PAP are acting like pure cowards this time round. From the last minute appointment of Heng Swee Keat at East Coast to the nonsensical gerrymandering. I know its not something new but their actions are really just dragging themselves down. 

I have nothing against their policies but am totally against the way they are trying to win votes. As the ruling party, they should be confident going into the elections. They should be confident of where they are running and the candidates leading the constituencies. Their cowardice just shows that they know they have not been doing enough for the people. If they have been serving the people well, then they should be confident of winning the seats. Instead of reacting to where the opposition are fielding certain candidates, PAP should be brave enough from the start to announce who is running where. If they have been doing enough and have gained the trust and love from the people, certainly they would be voted in despite having a high profile opposition contesting for that GRC and not asking your DPM to lead the team 15 minutes before nomination closes. Some would say its a tactical move or strategy but the real strategy would’ve been to be there for your people the past 5 years and knowing that they will vote you in to lead them and be their voice even if the Earth is crumbling. 

If they realise certain clusters have more votes for opposition, then get down to the ground and find out why, assess their situation then gain back their trust in the PAP, not draw them into a pro-PAP constituency. That’s just making the residents even more upset since they are sort of being silenced. 

And if they have been serving the people well, they shouldn’t be afraid if the media gave a neutral view of the opposition and shared the opposition candidates’ credibility as much as the incumbents. “So what if the opposition has some degree from Cambridge, I’ve done more for you than the opposition has and you know I will stay by your side during the next 5 years”. The millennials are not foolish enough to fall for propaganda on the media. We can sniff it out and expose it for all you know and that’s not gonna be good down the road when we become the majority of voters. Again, PAP is only dragging themselves down in the long run. 

Serve your damn people as you say you would. Give a fair fight to the opposition and show your confidence based on what you have done for your people and constituency. Let the people make their decisions based on equal knowledge of both parties. Lines have to be drawn. Votes are for voices in Parliament. Provide equal necessities and upgrading for all Singaporeans even for those living in opposition constituencies because its their damn right. They paid as much taxes as those living in PAP constituencies so they shouldn’t be getting any less. Be transparent of your actions instead of pulling a POFMA for any allegations.

I assume the situation will be closer to GE2011 than GE2015 when voters upset with how the PAP was running country limited them to a mere 60% of the popular vote and the loss of Aljunied GRC to the WP. In 2020 it will be them being upset with issues like the handling of Covid-19, maybe the Elected Presidency coupled with what looks like the best batch of Opposition politicians in decades to run for office. 

In this scenario I predict the Opposition will take 23 seats and it will be in the following SMCs and GRCs:

\-Hougang(WP)

\-Aljunied(WP)

\-Potong Pasir (SPP)

\-Bukit Batok(SDP)

\-Bukit Panjang(SDP)

\-West Coast (PSP)

\-East Coast(WP)

\-Jalan Besar(PVP)

&amp;#x200B;

Hougang SMC &amp; Aljunied GRC

\-Together they consist of 6 seats and are currently held by WP. As Hougang is the WP stronghold I don't see it going to PAP just yet, even if Png Eng Huat has stepped down. 2015 was a shock in seeing the WP vote share drop below 60% but if we get more of 2011 it shouldn't drop any lower. 

\-If voters opt for more of the same, its likely they keep Hougang and even Aljunied as this is not a situation like 2015. WP has held Aljunied for 9 years now and voters will know their neighbourhood didn't collapse or they needed to repent like what PAP said. 

Potong Pasir SMC

\-It went to PAP by the narrowest of margins in 2011 but they retained it comfortably in 2015. Now Jose Raymond, the SPP chairman arrives to challenge Sitoh Yin.

\-I'm impressed by Jose's eloquence and he's one of those guys who doesn't show up every 5 years just to campaign and disappear. 

\-Based on social media posts and his own interview, he comes across as sincere and carries himself in a way that I think Chiam See Tong would approve of, having been inspired by the man himself. 

\-He's been a journalist and has a background in the Singapore Sports Council so he's got the CV and a sincerity in front of the camera. In a 2011 style election he'd win and be SPP's representative in Parliament.  

Bukit Batok SMC

\- Dr. Chee Soon Juan returns to take on Murali Pillai in a rematch of 2016's by-election where Murali with 62% of the vote.

\-Dr. Chee is a mainstay in politics although he was barred from running in any GE from 2001 to 2015 due him being bankrupt. In 2015 he attempted to contest Holland-Bukit Timah GRC but lost with only 33% of the vote.

\-Personally I think his party's ideas lean too much into welfare with little thought of how it will be paid for but in 2020 with the economy being bad, people might actually buy into his ideas and vote him in. 

Bukit Panjang SMC

\-Paul Tambyah might be from SDP but I actually think he's more capable than Dr. Chee and if anything he should be the face of SDP. 

\-His background in NCID and expertise on Covid-19  will be much needed in Parliament. Honestly one of the candidates I hope gets elected. He's in an SMC so there's no anchor minister to fend off and a favourable 2011 scenario would see him riding into Parliament. 

West Coast GRC

\-Tan Cheng Bock helms a team against PAP's own team led by S Iswaran. 

\-PSP goes into this fight with a lot of hype and Tan Cheng Bock seems to be really popular on the ground. It feels like he might just get what he wanted back in 2011 and 2017 and that is to be elected back into a government position. 

\-In a 2011 scenario I think he would probably take this 55-45 like WP did in Jurong. 

East Coast GRC

\-A Nicole Seah led WP team versus the PM-in waiting Heng Swee Keat, drafted in at the last minute possibly to counter Nicole Seah. 

\-I don't know if this is a brilliant move to plug a possible PAP loss without a guy like HSK anchoring the spot or PAP overestimating Heng's powers. 

\-Back in 2011 Nicole Seah was with NSP and scored an impressive 43% of the votes against the Marine Parade PAP team led by ESM Goh Chok Tong. Now she's in the WP blue and not surrounded by idiots, she can score an upset against HSK in a 2011 style situation who while a capable minister is no Goh Chok Tong. 

Jalan Besar GRC

\-The most surprising match up sees Lim Tean's PVP go up against Josephine Teo's PAP that is looking like a reenactment of the US Presidential Election of 2016. 

\-Personally I detest Lim Tean as a guy who seems to be overly critical of the PAP but up against Josephine Teo, the Minister of Manpower who really dropped the ball when it comes to the foreign worker dorm situation and one of the factors for the Circuit Breaker being implemented, I think he has a shot. 

\-Throw in an election with a scenario closer to 2011 and you'll get a very ugly upset where there are no real winners.

&amp;#x200B;

This general election will be like no other that we have experienced,” Singapore’s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, declared this week, announcing that the city-state would go to the polls on July 10th. Procedures may be a little different from usual, given the continuing outbreak of covid-19. But the outcome will be just like the previous 12 national elections: the ruling People’s Action Party (pap) will romp home with a huge majority of seats.  


The pap is a slick political machine which has held power since before independence in 1965. Its share of the popular vote has never dipped below 60%. Even at its lowest ebb, in 2011, the party retained 93% of the elected seats in Parliament. Last time around, in 2015, it won almost 70% of the popular vote, perhaps boosted by the death earlier that year of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first prime minister and the incumbent’s father.  


The pap’s popularity stems in large part from its competence. It has presided over decades of rapid economic growth, with little of the corruption that plagues neighbouring countries. But the party is too thorough to leave its prospects up to voters. It has devised an electoral system that makes life difficult for its opponents. In most constituencies a party must field a slate of four or five candidates to compete, with the winning slate taking all the seats. The need in such seats to find multiple well-known candidates, pay for all the deposits (at almost $10,000 a pop) and win over a much larger pool of voters puts a heavy burden on opposition parties. In fact, only one such constituency—Aljunied—is not in the pap’s hands, having fallen to the Workers’ Party in 2011.  


The agencies that draw electoral districts and supervise the vote are not independent, but answer to the prime minister. Exacting rules govern everything from the size and placement of signs to a ban on negative campaigning. Candidates must not say anything “that may cause racial or religious tensions or affect social cohesion”.  


The rules will be even tighter than normal this year because of the coronavirus. Rallies are banned, which is a blow to the opposition, which usually counts on big jamborees to fire up cautious voters. Instead, up to five members of a party can campaign together on “walkabouts”. Each member of the group must stay a metre away from the others and from the public, to limit potential contagion. The government will also help candidates to stream online pitches to voters. Campaigning on television and radio is strictly limited, but that did not prevent six ministers, including Mr Lee, from giving televised speeches earlier this month outlining the pap’s vision—nothing to do with the election, just part of the fight against covid-19.  


The biggest hindrance to the opposition, however, is the perpetual stifling of public debate. The constitution lists no fewer than eight different reasons why Parliament might limit freedom of speech, and it has made eager use of them. Since the previous election, the government has strengthened laws on harassment and contempt of court and dreamed up a new law to expunge online statements it deems false: the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act. A tightening of the Public Order Act requires organisers of public protests to apply for a permit at least 28 days before the event or face a fine of $14,400 or up to a year in prison, or both. The overall effect—driven home by frequent investigations and prosecutions of opposition politicians for assaults on truth and the good name of the authorities—is to discourage criticism and participation in parties other than the pap.  


Nonetheless, the opposition has won over some notable recruits. Lee Hsien Yang, the prime minister’s brother, has joined a new opposition outfit, the Progress Singapore Party (psp), which was founded last year. Its leader, Tan Cheng Bock, formerly served as an mp for the pap for 25 years but speaks now of a climate of fear in Singapore. The party wants to boost job creation, delay any rise in a nationwide goods-and-services tax for five years, and lower the voting age from 21 to 18.  


The government’s main vulnerability stems from its handling of covid-19 and the economic damage the epidemic will bring. At first Singapore was held up as a model in the battle against the disease. Then tens of thousands of cases began to emerge in dormitories for migrant workers. In total the country has seen more than 40,000 infections. In response, it imposed a “circuit breaker” from early April until mid-June during which most Singaporeans had to stay at home. Partly as a result, the government forecasts that the economy will shrink by 4-7% this year.  


The pap’s “4g” cadres—its rising fourth generation of leaders—have been given leading roles in managing the pandemic. **Their lacklustre champion, Heng Swee Keat**, the finance minister, who is expected to take over from Mr Lee during the next parliamentary term, has devised several stimulus packages worth a total of $72bn, almost 20% of gdp. More than half comes from Singapore’s formidable reserves. “Our reserves allow us to deal with this crisis from a position of strength, and give us options in a period of uncertainty like this,” he says.  


It should all be enough to retain the support of anxious voters. In recent surveys, some 80% of respondents told Blackbox, a Singaporean pollster, that the country is heading in the right direction. The real test for the pap will come after the election. A prolonged downturn will gnaw away at the basic compact between the pap and its voters, who disregard its domineering and nannyish ways because of the economic growth and social stability it has provided. Meanwhile Mr Lee has said he will retire before his 70th birthday, early in 2022.

TLDR: Political fear mongering is a tool used to garner votes. Perhaps not beneath candidates running for parliament in Singapore. 

Our future PM has stated that a clear mandate is required, he has also stated that anything other than PAP is risky.

I would like to remind everyone that the government of the day is formed by a simple majority. And with approximately 63 seats that government will have free reign over our country.

Looking at the opposition, note comments by WP (above article) and PSP ( [https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/progress-singapore-party-member-draws-ire-with-remarks-on-proposed-opposition-alliance](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/progress-singapore-party-member-draws-ire-with-remarks-on-proposed-opposition-alliance) ). The opposition clearly does not have faith in their own peers to win against the PAP. What are the chances that oppositions aside from PSP and WP might win a single seat?

In any case, let's evaluate the potential contests that the PAP faces - outside of WP and PSP.

We start with our honorable SPP, thank you Mr Chiam for your years of service and dedication.  What is the SPP without CST, the party has been in a downward spiral since he took a step back. A party run on a person's legacy is nothing but an empty shell.

Our resident siao lang keng (this is not a term given by me), SDP, has always put forth people with very strong credentials but they still face a huge stigma because of reasons. Regardless, at the end of the day the majority of voters vote on emotion rather than rationality. With approximately 11 seats up for grabs, let's give CSJ 3 for the lulz, after all we should be looking at the worst case scenario for HSK right?

Next up! we have the NSP. This party likes to talk about jokes, unfortunately they are the funniest of the bunch! In 2011, it was called the nicole seah party, after a candidate! How low must you go before you completely lose your party's identity? With every face of the 2015 NSP joining a new party for 2020, what is the NSP? It is nothing but a brand new party with brand new faces. Cross fingers, in the best case opposition scenario NSP doesn't go bankrupt.

PPP, who gives up before the fight begins? Declaring its your last election before nomination day and complaining about how tough it is on your family - I feel for you. Really I get it. The people probably get it too.... I applaud you for putting nation before self but when you can't even support your family, please call it quits.

DPP, I guess I spoke too soon, the DPP pulled out before anyone even asked if they were contesting.

RP, the leader of RP is serving his SHN now, his campaigning is probably going to be highly ineffective from that position.

Did I forget to mention the SDA? An alliance meant to bring together groups of opposition parties - a bold idea by our dear CST. However, since leadership has changed hands, it is but a shell. In any case, the SDA will be contesting in ppp grc. with two-thirds of PAP's teo's standing in ppp grc, I doubt they stand a chance.

PV, I don't know much about lim tean, what I know about him is he enjoys pointing fingers at the government with little concrete solutions. For a tiny party to declare a shadow minister kind of signals they are slightly unhinged.

Red dot ?? The first time I heard of these people was last night, they are contesting in Jurong GRC. I think this signals outright that they are off the rails. DO you know who runs in Jurong? Can anyone tell me ????

&amp;#x200B;

YES, the prime minister we WANT and NEED but do not DESERVE!!!!

Apparently we aren't ready for an Indian PM (shame on Singapore )

BUT WAIT, I have only mentioned 11 parties.... oh right... one party DISSOLVED!

With a total of 21 seats being contested by WP, giving TCB west coast grc and throwing in 3 SMCs for SDP (because why not) . PAP will return with a minimum of 64 seats! A beautiful 2/3's majority to pass any bill that the next government may desire.

In fact, if koh poh koon decides to abandon YCK to create a 4 way fight in punggol west, leaving YCK seat empty, The PAP will still be returned with a 2/3's majority!

But despite getting closer in 2011, when the national mood swung against the ruling People\'s Action Party (PAP), voters remained ultimately unconvinced.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This year, the WP is mounting a fresh challenge. But much has changed in both camps since the last time Singaporeans went to the polls.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For the PAP team, this year\'s general election marks the end of an era. Mr Lim Swee Say, the constituency\'s anchor minister, is likely to retire. But the identity of his successor is perhaps the party\'s best-kept secret so far.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Their long-time opponents in East Coast are also playing their cards close to their chests. Although it is clear that the WP\'s 2015 team will not return for a second bout, the party has given no indication of what its new line-up will look like.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lastly, the single seat of Fengshan, carved out of East Coast in the last general election,[ is now returning to the fold.](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge-four-new-smcs-created-as-three-existing-smcs-fengshan-sengkang-west-and)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The ebb and flow of political tides in East Coast over the past three elections has made it a constituency to watch, as both sides start squaring off to secure the mandate of its 121,772 voters.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But with much about each party\'s slate still undisclosed, it remains unclear what shape this battle will take.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;GUESSING GAME  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All signs indicate that East Coast is likely to lose its anchor minister, Mr Lim, who has seen the constituency through two general elections and notched up a total of 23 years in politics. Mr Lim himself was moved to the constituency a month before the hustings in 2011 to shore up the PAP slate then.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;No official announcement has yet been made. But Mr Lim had previously indicated on two separate occasions that the 2011 election would be his last, making his retirement, in a sense, overdue.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Activists expect his successor to come from a group representation constituency with two anchor ministers. At one point, the talk centred on Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee, who is currently an MP for Jurong GRC. The constituency is helmed by Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But recent developments have made this possibility seem increasingly unlikely. Mr Lee has been making virtual appearances at West Coast GRC events in recent weeks, prompting speculation that he could move there to bolster the PAP team.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Another four GRCs - Bishan-Toa Payoh, Pasir Ris-Punggol, Tampines and Tanjong Pagar - have ministers to spare.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But the majority appear to have already been earmarked for posts in other constituencies, leaving just four options for East Coast.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Tanjong Pagar GRC could offer up either Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing, or Minister in the Prime Minister\'s Office Indranee Rajah.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And Tampines - which shares a boundary with East Coast - has Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat and Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Dr Gillian Koh, who is deputy director for research at the Institute of Policy Studies, says the opposition will not be in for an easy fight if a fourth-generation PAP leader is fielded in East Coast.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This will also be the case if a strong 3G leader is fielded, she adds.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Aside from Mr Lim, East Coast will also lose three-term MP Lee Yi Shyan, who was Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry and National Development until he returned to the backbench in 2015, following a minor stroke.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr Tan Kiat How, the 43-year-old former chief executive of the Info-communications Media Development Authority, is tipped to succeed him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The constituency\'s two other MPs - Senior Minister of State for Defence and Foreign Affairs Maliki Osman, and three-term backbencher Jessica Tan - are likely to stay on. Joining them will be one-term Fengshan MP Cheryl Chan, whose single-seat constituency is now part of the GRC.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;HOT SEATS  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In 1997, Bedok GRC was expanded to take in parts of Eunos, Marine Parade, Tampines, Changi and Aljunied. This amalgamation was renamed East Coast GRC. The new GRC went uncontested in that year\'s election, as well as the next, in 2001.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It saw its first electoral battle in 2006, when a WP team led by lawyer Chia Ti Lik - then deputy organising secretary of the party - entered the fray. The PAP team, helmed by then Deputy Prime Minister S. Jayakumar, sent their opponents packing. The WP\'s vote share then was 36.1 per cent.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In 2011 - the year in which the PAP\'s overall vote share fell from 66.6 per cent to 60.1 per cent - the WP mounted a fresh challenge. This time, it was up against a team led by then labour chief, Mr Lim. The PAP team won with 54.8 per cent of the vote. East Coast was the worst-performing GRC won by the party that year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The next general election in 2015 saw a massive national swing towards the incumbent, which secured 69.9 per cent of the popular vote. In East Coast, the men in blue nevertheless garnered a 39.3 per cent vote share.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Its slate comprised IT consultant Gerald Giam, former librarian Mohamed Fairoz Shariff, sociologist Daniel Goh and consultancy firm chief executive Leon Perera. The last two were subsequently appointed Non-Constituency MPs (NCMPs) - seats reserved for losing opposition candidates with the highest vote shares.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;That year, Fengshan SMC was also carved out of East Coast and subsequently became the subject of a heated electoral contest between long-time PAP grassroots volunteer Cheryl Chan and the WP\'s Dennis Tan, a shipping lawyer. Ms Chan won with 57.5 per cent of the vote.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The WP\'s 2015 slate will not be making a comeback this year. Associate Professor Goh has dropped out of the running, citing health reasons, while Mr Giam and Mr Perera will move to contest as part of the WP\'s Aljunied GRC team instead.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Who, then, will the WP send to East Coast? The party has traditionally sent its B Team to contest the constituency. But the creation of a new Sengkang GRC, coupled with Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong\'s decision to step down as an MP in Marine Parade GRC, could give it pause for thought.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""East Coast appears to have moved down the WP\'s pecking order,"" notes Singapore Management University law don Eugene Tan, a former Nominated MP.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;""They have long contested in East Coast GRC, which has yielded them a few NCMP seats, and seek to keep faith with the voters who previously voted for them.

The Road Ahead
_________________

Everywhere, politics is adversarial. Growing up in Singapore, it looked like a blood sport at times. But that did not stop ordinary Singaporeans from stepping up to stand as candidates for The Workers' Party. After all, a desire for fairness, justice and equality is a human emotion, felt by all, and it extends to politics too. These emotions probably explain why many of my colleagues and I, and those before us, decided to join politics. 

But opposition politics in Singapore is not for the faint of heart.

Since Mr Low took over the WP in 2001, the Party has had to pivot very differently to ensure that an opposition can not only survive, but thrive and play an effective check and balance role in the national interest. 

Mr Low decided. The Party agreed. It was going to be rational and responsible opposition politics, no matter what.
 
Looking ahead, and more than ever in an uncertain world, this approach will require us to see beyond the horizon, beyond partisan politics, so as to fight for the betterment of Singapore and Singaporeans. 

For the Workers’ Party, the constitutional oath all Parliamentarians take when they are sworn into Parliament will be an important guiding light as we walk with Singapore. To faithfully discharge our duties, to the best of our abilities, to bear true faith and allegiance to Singapore, and to preserve, protect and defend our Constitution. 

Make a donation, no matter how big or small, so that a rational and responsible opposition is always there to keep our politics fair, just and balanced. Since 1957. All-weather. Through thick or thin.

I have been dealing with severe depression ever since before CB and it has only gotton worse. I felt suffocated by the laws and restrictions. Initially, it was hard for me to accept the fact that meeting my S/O (someone that helps me get through the days) was against the law. It was difficult for me to leave my house to have a breath of fresh air because of rules bounded by my family. As a 2020 graduate who’s awaiting for university to start, I have no proper commitments(e.g. work, school) during this period. I felt I lost my sense of purpose in life. Day after day of lying in bed not attending to my hobbies due to lack of interest, depression was hitting me hard.

I tried using logic to fight my heavy emotions and to assure myself that this was all for the better. To protect my family, my S/O and keep us safe. I tried making my time useful. I baked/attended online courses/did more housework; guided siblings in their homework, cooked and cleaned the house. But my breakdowns happened daily, I felt locked up at home.

I held onto hope and that there will be an end date for me to work towards (e.g. 4th May). The multiple changes to their schedule over the past few months have been torturing and caused frequent long hours of crying and suicidal thoughts.

Only just yesterday, I broke down for an hour(again) on why it was already Mid-June and that there was no announcement. I understood that Phase 2 allows me to visit S/O again and to leave the house without a purpose of “needing to buy essentials”. I wanted to stop being confined by these 4 walls, by rules and by judgment. And to be free.

And on 19th June, I can finally be free.



Note: I understand that Phase 2 does not mean the virus has been eradicated and we can be reckless. I don’t plan to crowd at populated areas, travel everywhere, and act as if everything is okay. I won’t be partying everyday at different houses, cafe-hopping, going on shopping sprees, etc. I just want to be with S/O and be able to leave my house without being constantly questioned by the law and by my family. I just want to feel okay again.

131,singapore,241403,So mad at our Covid situation,h7znxe,nideba,1592018914,27,0,"I know now it's not the best situation and time to be blaming anybody now and I'm not telling you guys to undermine the govt efforts to combat covid, me myself included, but I'm just so mad at our situation and just want to get it off my chest.

Well first of all, regarding that mask guideline thing. Early on in this covid fight, govt stance has been for the public not to wear a mask because the masks should go to medical personnel. I totally agree with it. But question is, if the government had a stockpile of reusable mask that is sufficient for everyone, why didn't they distribute it earlier, so people can decide for themselves if they want to wear it? I was wearing disposable surgical masks in the early stages because I was aware of the asymptomatic cases(from the news), but I stopped wearing them after I debated with a friend about how the masks should go to medical personnel. There is no way the govt doesn't know about the asymptomatic covid cases reported in China, and now they are reversing their stance on it?? This was always the reason why I wanted to wear mask in the first place. How can I practice social responsibility when I don't even know if I have covid, and I go to work as per normal, interact with my family and friends. LOL. And then come April and they panicked, and reversed the whole stance on wearing masks. But too late. 

Why do I say too late, because the covid cases are ald hidden in the community. Everyday we look at the news and see seemingly low number of  community cases, but the truth is, there are still asymptomatic cases which unknowingly is still passing the virus around. Nobody knows who they are, they don't know who they are. And now how are we gonna weed them out? Test the whole population? China, even till now they are still picking up asymptomatic cases today.

Look at Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, which geographically and economically is considered more closely linked to China, there are all living life as per normal. And look at Singapore. And we want to say sg ministers are deserving of their high pay because of their high calibre. LOL.

I admit that part of my frustration comes from when I had that mask debate with my friend, I was ridiculed. And now what, everyone is wearing a mask on the streets. One thing I learnt from this saga is, if the govt is telling me there's no problem with xxx, I'm will be very worried.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/h7znxe/so_mad_at_our_covid_situation/,0.38,"['My guess is that they didn’t actually had a cloth mask stockpile and only went into cb when they ensured they’d manufactured/sourced enough for everyone.

133,singapore,239202,Here's my opinion: Singaporeans sharing BLM posts should not be seen as a bad thing or simply as hypocrisy,gvaoih,cyhlalala,1591115915,75,0,"I agree that many are probably just jumping on the bandwagon, reposting without learning more beyond the surface, and just ""chasing clout"". Many posts both here and on Instagram have pointed this out.    


However, I believe there's another way to approach this so as to create meaningful change.   Firstly, I'd like to address the sentiment of ""don't comment on others' politics"", ""fix your own issues first"". To quote the [other reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gv53pd/unpopular_opinion_i_have_had_it_with_all_the/) that's trending now, ""If you're one of those people, I rather you go back to your Fitness or zoom call insta stories, and don't talk politics if you have no idea or first-hand experience of what you're talking about.""   


Here's why I disagree with that statement and the sentiment of that post.  


* First-hand experience should not be a prerequisite to commenting on other countries' issues. 
* I don't think this is a political issue. It's a human issue and politics should respond, not dictate. 
* Why do we learn history? Why does local media report international news? 
* Talking about one issue doesn't necessitate ignorance over others.
* Bringing up past inaction amidst a current discourse in this case is simply being used as an ad hominem attack to devalue current activism.

There's an assumption being made that those who are now speaking up about the BLM movement don't care about local racism. The two aren't mutually exclusive. 

If anything, learning about one directly impacts the other. It's not separate issues of whites vs blacks, chinese privilege vs foreign workers and minorities. It's at its core anti-racism, which applies even if you're not a US citizen. 

So let's say most people are resharing BLM posts without doing any further research and only want to chase clout. You can shame them and see this as purely a bad thing, but you could also encourage further discourse, reflection and push for meaningful change. 

What's happening now is, ironically, ""thought-policing"". 

If you're an influencer, or just a regular social media user, you're being shamed for bringing up issues because ""you didn't talk about \[place social issue here\] so you're just being a hypocrite"". This pressure is perhaps the exact reason why people aren't going deeper into issues, and sticking to simple resharing. We're scared to share our thoughts cause we don't want to be ""wrong"", ""it's not our place"".

So what then? Silence? Because silence sure as hell has not improved things for our minorities, our foreign workers. 

How should we respond then, to people who are resharing and talking about BLM issues now, despite not having spoken about previous issues, or local issues? Should we simply shame them for being hypocrites, silence them? Cause that won't achieve the meaningful change in society we are looking for. What that will achieve is fear. Fear of being ""wrong"", fear of speaking out.

In the scientific community, being ""wrong"" is seen as a good thing. Hypotheses being proven wrong are not condemned. They are celebrated, because only through making mistakes do you get closer to the truth. In a debate, the goal is not to prove who is right and who is wrong. It's about exchanging ideas and reaching greater truth together.

I believe the same should apply here. Yes, maybe some people are simply resharing because they're jumping on the bandwagon (not all are, I will expand on this). But how should we respond to these people? Add yet another layer of hypocrisy by asking them to shut up? Or try and provoke a deeper conversation?

If one of your friends reshare a BLM post and you dislike it cause you feel like they're not sincere about it. Why not DM them? Ask them how you think this can be solved. Because the answer to that question is directly relevant to our own problems with racism. 

Yes, it's a shame that many are talking about the issues in US now despite staying silent on local issues with racism. Dwelling in that shame will not create a meaningful change in Singapore. What we can do, is observe and participate in the discourse, the fight that's going on now in the US. That is not apathy towards local issues. That's a step in the right direction for dealing with our own issues, because we CAN learn from others. That's why we learn history, that's why we read the news. 

Changing your opinions and behaviour should be CELEBRATED. Not shamed. We should not define people by the lack of action in the past, but by their actions now and in the future. If 6 months down the road, your friends who are sharing BLM now have not talked about any other issues, then go ahead, drop them a DM and ask about their thoughts about another issue. But right now, shaming people for past inaction does nothing except to diminish progress. Congrats, you've scared someone into not speaking out again about anything. 

When you see someone talking about BLM now after a history of silence regarding other issues, CONGRATULATE them. Praise them. Tell them how meaningful their words are. And encourage them to share more. If someone is posting stuff that you disagree with, engage in a polite discourse with them. That's how you create change. Not by tossing even more hate.

Let me give some anecdotal examples to challenge the idea that Singaporeans are only speaking out about BLM to ""chase clout"" and don't know anything about the situation.

1. Black American culture is extremely relevant to many in Singapore. Personally, I am a budding jazz musician. My entire life for the past few years has been revolved around learning Black American Music, its history, and practicing the artform. My musical and life heroes/idols are mostly black. Of course, this doesn't mean that I can viscerally understand what it means to be a black person and face a lifetime of oppression and racism. But I can definitely form thoughts about it and lend my support. Yes, I am guilty of not having the same level of response in the past when it came to local issues. I was convinced that I would be apolitical and never vote in Singapore. Does that mean that now that I choose to speak up about racism in the US, I don't care about racism in Singapore? No. If anything, taking a public stand and sharing public opinions about BLM is now giving me the courage to talk about local issues as well. (It feels scarier to comment on local issues than to comment on external ones). So what has sharing and learning about the BLM movement done locally? Well, it has raised another person who will now, after a lifetime of being silent, speak out about issues with local racism. And probably more issues in the future. BLM has taught me that silence is compliance, and that it's not okay to simply be not racist, that we have to fight and be anti-racist. 
2. I made shorter versions of this post on my own Instagram. I've had a few people DM me already. Here are some quotes: 

&gt;I have been fretting and overthinking so much and been made to feel guilty by influencers and blind policing that it has on many occasions today made me feel completely distracted from what the crux of the issue was  
&gt;  
&gt;It's like so do I speak out or not......  
&gt;  
&gt;Am I supposed to speak out?  
&gt;  
&gt;It's terrifying to be put under that thought  
&gt;  
&gt;The policing has been so intense  
&gt;  
&gt;Sometimes it's like gotta think twice thrice before putting anything out there or not putting anything out there  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm learning too. To have the courage to speak up and not be afraid of what ppl may think or if they gonna shame me for whatever reasons then so be it.

&amp;#x200B;

This is why I am making this post. There are many out there who are NOT simply chasing clout. There are many being inspired to finally speak up. These are people who can be encouraged to learn more, think more, discuss more. These are the people who will eventually gain the courage to fight for local issues as well. 

But for some reason they are being shamed for trying to speak. They are being defined by what they have done in the past, not what they are trying to do now. 

We need to stop this blame culture if we want Singaporeans to stop being silent about local racism. What you are telling people by asking them to shut up about BLM is that their thoughts don't matter, it's better to be quiet. Is that what we want in regards to local issues? 

On that note, please please please tell me if you disagree. I know that I am not perfect, and it may be hypocritical for me to get worked up over racism in the US when there is plenty of racism in Singapore. But I want to improve. I want to know what I can do both for those overseas, and locally. For me, this is a first step. I don't want it to be my last. And getting to share my thoughts here and hopefully discuss with you guys is a privilege that I should be exercising more. It's taking a lot of courage for me to post this, and I can empathize with my many people are silent about racism in Singapore. I'd like to help these people gain the courage to speak out as well by asking for less hate and blame, more meaningful discussion.

134,singapore,239202,"Unpopular opinion: BLM and Influencers - might be justified to feel irritated at influencers, but unfair to say that we're not educated enough to support",gvamdz,tetriscannoli,1591115733,3,0,"I have studied in the US for some time, and I would like to say a couple of things on the matter. Firstly, I can imagine it must be irritating to view people who have never supported anything in their lives only support BLM because it's trending. I have deleted FB and Insta a while back so I'm lucky to not view such behavior first hand, though I can imagine it's irritating. After all, BLM is a very important movement and to see it reduced to a mere ""fad"" is upsetting.

But I think it's in a way good that it's getting a lot more visibility, even if people use it as a way to jump on the bandwagon. BLM is a very important movement; blacks have been subject to profiling police brutality, unfair outcomes in criminal justice trials (esp compared to whites), and all sorts of systemic racism. It's not really hard to try gain ""a perspective"" or ""make an informed choice"" about this. Police brutality towards blacks has been headlining for a long time, and even putting brutality aside, the civil rights movement in the US only really kicked off in the 1950s and 1960s. That is fairly recent, and it's not difficult to imagine that there are still remnants of racial oppression present in the US. We are talking about a country which enslaved black people, which viewed them as property, which built up its economy on the backs of largely unpaid, indentured labor. It's a whole, historically entrenched system of oppression that will seep into today's practices. I think this context is important to keep in mind when thinking about police brutality, about whether one even need to shy away from deciding on one's standpoint, and when thinking about even issues that have arisen in recent debate (e.g. black lives matter or all lives matter? (black lives of course, it's their time to fight back against the oppression, no one should make it about everyone else) Can white people say the n-word? (no, because you're perpetuating the system of oppression that serve to keep black people in inferiority).

I know it sucks to see people jumping on the bandwagon. But if people use this as a way to get educated about black history in the US, and about police brutality, that is always a good thing. And I think we shouldn't go about doing too much whataboutery - what about racism on our shores? What about women in Afghanistan dying? The problem with whataboutery is you can say what about for any other issue you raise. When people talked about migrant workers and almost //all// radio stations asked people to donate their $600 to migrant workers, one might argue, what about singaporeans who have lost their jobs, who are even more desperately poor and at wits end, why encourage an en masse donation to one particular group? That's the problem with whataboutery. It never stops.

One can care about both blacks and both racism on our shores. It's true that right now we're seeing a lot of hypocritical behaviour. And so when the time comes when something else makes the headlines, something to do with singapore's racism, call these people out on it. Ask them why they are so willing to support blacks then but refuse to support anti-racism in Singapore. But not **right now**. It's kinda not right to, right now, call out people who support blacks and say what about xyz. The black lives matter movement is an extremely important one, and it's a cause worth supporting. Even if initially for a fad, I think we can all learn a lot as it unfolds.

What I **cannot stand** however, is influencers/anyone saying to SINGAPOREANS that if you don't support the BLM you're complicit in the oppression of blacks, or to equate in some sense american racism and singapore racism (not in the sense of whataboutery but more like importing the same severity). It's really not. This is american exceptionalism here - in its most terrible. America's treatment of blacks is almost unparalleled, it is backed by hundreds of years of slavery, of oppression, of viewing blacks of not even deserving of human rights, then property rights, civil rights, the right to freedom to engage in trade, to contract, to black codes, jim crows, and finally now - perceived civil/legal equality - with oppression finding its way to other things like law enforcement, jury perception, job advancement etc. Yes, racism in Singapore exists. But it'd be wrong for influencers to equate it to american racism - I can't quantify severity, obviously, but clearly it's not backed by the same horrifying history.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gvamdz/unpopular_opinion_blm_and_influencers_might_be/,0.4,"['Yes!

135,singapore,239142,Unpopular Opinion: I have had it with all the Black Lives Matter insta posts/stories from Singaporeans.,gv53pd,cryozy,1591094916,523,1,"Unpopular Opinion, but here goes.

I'm so damn done with the Black lives matter stories by Singaporeans. It's so damn ass triggering. You guys r mass posting shit that you obviously don't give a fuck about, jumping on the trending bandwagon like your fitness and dalgona coffee stories, but compared to the prev two, this time you're mass story posting a view that you guys obviously have no knowledge on.

If you're American or have lived in US for a period of time I get it. Or if you have an insta following that mainly makes up of Americans then okay fine you're trying to spread awareness or fight for an issue you feel strongly about or can relate to. But if you're a random xiao Di or tiktok xiao mei sinki that has no idea what the situation like is in the US or has no US following then thr no reason for you to post it except to be trendy. You have no fking idea how things like are in US to make a judgement, you are fighting for causes you have no clue of. Don't get me wrong, BLM movement is a movement worth fighting for but I don't post fking BLM stories because firstly im not educated enough on the situation thr to make a clear judgment without being influenced by what I see on media and secondly, is thr a fking pt in spreading BLM messages to Singaporeans? What is the fking pt of posting stories of BLM posts to Singaporeans who can do what? Buy plane tickets ( also not possible) to US and march with the protestors? You think you spread to those tiktok ah lians got any fking use? You're not doing it for the Blacks, you're doing it for yourself.

And what infuriates me the most is that these Singaporeans can go on and on about BLM and how impt it is to protect the Black rights but when it comes to racial discrimination in SG I don't see them talking about it? Is it you don't care? BLM and racial discrimination in SG r essentially the same cause to fight for. Is It suddenly when it strikes close to home then you too scared to make an opinion? What happen to your daily 99999 BLM posts? You're suddenly an expert on Black rights but not the minority rights in SG? If you're not knowledgable on it, then don't blare out your cloudy opinions on social media. Strive to solve your own issues locally before fking talking about issues overseas. Fighting for Black rights in SG isn't going to solve the racial inequality in SG.

If you're one of those people, I rather you go back to your Fitness or zoom call insta stories, and don't talk politics if you have no idea or first-hand experience of what you're talking about.

So I would say that, yes, elections are coming nearer by the day, and you have to be prepared for it.\n\n&gt; ""If you look at what other countries have done, they have been able to do it (hold an election), even under very difficult circumstances.

137,singapore,255892,A non-civil civil servant's thoughts about the civil service,i2sw9p,Tight_Recover,1596440604,323,1,"I originally wanted to write a short post on my thoughts and it ended up being a super long post. Quite an apt analogy for civil service work in general - work is usually simple until it eventually becomes tedious and overly complicated.

Quick details for background purpose - I am:

* Mid-30s, slightly more than 10 years into my career
* Education was thankfully paid for by the G
* Rotated around a bit so I have experienced working in and leading a couple of teams, suffice to say things have gone and look well in my career
* Definitely not leaning towards incumbent when it comes to voting
* Deemed ""deviant"" at work - I fight hard for alternative views and challenge bosses whenever I feel like I'm obliged to, which is very often

It'd be interesting to know what the public thinks of civil servants, especially in light of political events (what with the ugly AHPETC/AHTC saga involving MND) and the current economic downturn (where everyone's suddenly passionate for public service). A few general points for those considering to join or just pick the brains of a sometimes shit tier (I consider myself that) civil servant. You can also ask your questions and I can offer my views.

**Work Hours Aren't What You Think**

I see people saying that civil servants are all ""jiak liao bee"", working 9-5. These are not that true. In fact many who join find it hard to adapt to the long hours and emphasis on civil service formatting/procedures. The issue is that the civil service is very good at adding (often meaningless) work, but bad at reducing irrelevant work. When there's no profits/losses and we try to uphold the public interest while pleasing the bosses, everything becomes good-to-have. People are risk adverse. Of course work keeps piling up and we all go through motions for a lot of stuff. But still do.

In general, the working culture is messed up if you hate to work. If you're good, you work more. People trust you more so you end up working on more stuff. This incentivises the incompetent. On the other hand, the talented folks and scholars work really hard. You can work 8am to 10pm everyday, 6-7 days a week. Constantly on your laptop and waiting for your bosses to clear your work so you can send to the next level of bosses.

It's true that there're deadweight (like any organisation) folks around. These people like to make it tough for everyone by refusing to work or keeping to their scope of work. You can often hear them say that's not under my purview or you got the wrong person. It makes you want to tear your hair out but that's life I guess, such shit tier people are there in every organisation. These people you learn to ignore them and just GTFO when they appear near you. More often than not they are older, perhaps jaded with work, or wanting to focus on family life or hobbies. Whatever it is though, it takes a lot of EQ to deal with bullshit like this.

**Is there Groupthink?**

In terms of wanting to do good, there definitely are people who are trying to challenge the norms within and offer a dissenting voice. Of course, work environment norms apply. We don't try to embarrass the Minister (Chairman), Permanent Secretary (CEO), or bosses, and we try not to be an ass to other people when raising critiques. With that being said, groupthink is pretty strong, because often the direction is set by the Permanent Secretary or Deputy Secretary, who are big shots, and it's hard to deviate far from that initial decision. It also often takes a crisis or a bigshot to move things fast, otherwise you get stuck with incrementalism.

And of course you've sycophants and pleasers, who only want to impress bosses to raise their CEP and get their good gradings.

At the end of the day though, you're only an employee. The politicians have the mandate, the civil service management have the authority, so you just need to bite the bullet and do whatever they decide. Even if you disagree. Be professional. If it bothers you so much, resign. If there's wrongdoing, whistleblow.

**Bureaucracy is Painful**

Civil service internal red tape is painful. Very painful. The amount of work you have to do is incredible. Consult, give input, apply for stuff, send ""black-and-white"" emails (record purpose), write papers, organise meetings, file stuff (although many people nowadays don't). CC lists are lengthy for a (stupid) reason. So much pointless, bullshit, and tedious work.

The idea was that this is all for accountability, so when we get audited we can show what we did and how the decisions were made. Even though I don't like it, I don't really see a solution because there's no alternative. In fact, I'd say I think the service makes a lot of mistakes, and most of the time it's not found out. At least if you keep records, the mistakes can potentially be discovered, which is better for the public.

But that means if you want to join, be prepared to join the crowd and do the work.

**Civil Servants are Not PAP Lapdogs**

A common online criticism is that we're PAP lapdogs. That's actually not that wrong, in principle and by design. We serve the political appointees who were elected by the public. They have the political mandate and that's how a democracy works.

But we are not so much a lapdog, than a service that thinks through and recommends to the Minister what he/she wants. And then execute it. However, I've also seen many cases where there is room to do stuff without needing to involve the Minister. Like private companies don't need the CEO to intervene or know about the details for most issues.

**It is Quite a Good Career**

The HR schemes are good. Flexi benefits, if your ministry or stat board has, are good. The service pays well for the people who want to work, and damn well for people who do the bare minimum. Nowadays it's not an iron rice bowl, although it's still hard to get fired once you get confirmed (need a lot of justifications and counselling sessions on record to make sure any dismissal is justified).

For those who are ambitious and do a lot more work, you get paid the same as your peers, but you at least get some enjoyment out of thinking that you'd be graded higher during appraisal (and get better bonuses and prospects).

Many get disappointed when you realise your bosses just don't give as much of a shit about your work as you thought they would. Sorry but working hard doesn't always pay off, like in the private sector. Your work needs to be good, or minimally you need to be able to sell your ideas. As an aside, SMU folks who are typically known for good presentation don't seem to do particularly well in my experience. You need to be able to demonstrate strong critical thinking skills and attention to details, which isn't really related to your school.

For mid-careerists from the private sector, it's hard. It's even harder when the motivation for joining is to get a slower pace of life. The pay is often lower, the pace isn't always slower (unless you opt for a ground posting or a deadend job). I know if you work for me, I'd be sure to work you hard (so you can learn, of course!).

**Scholars vs Farmers**

For the inevitable questions about scholars, let me say this: What is the point behind the question? Just kidding. (We do shit on politicians as well, sometimes even more brutal than the public because we see the shit that goes on behind the scenes.)

Scholars are seen as an investment, so there is definitely an ROI in mind when they come back to serve their bond. Now, leaving aside the question whether this is the right way, scholars are being slave driven when they're back. This presents itself as opportunities at work, to shine, to work with others, or just to pad their CV so that they can be ranked higher. It's hard work.

There're definitely farmers who rise faster than scholars, but the system is set up in a way that advantages the scholars more than average First Class Honours folks from local unis (and nowadays FCH is not that hard to get without the A- requirement). It helps when scholars are centrally managed by HR while the FCH grad is still finding his'/her way into the system as a clueless officer.

However, scholars I worked for and worked with are generally smarter, have better IQ, more driven, and learn faster than the average civil servant. This might be a result of socio-economic statuses (since scholars are generally more well-to-do and afford better nurturing), but in any case they are better objectively speaking. So it really is a combination of better calibre people and a system that gives them the chance to do well.

The scholars who fail and cannot do well (you can tell easily), these need no mention.

I will only say this: not everyone can be assessed well at age 18, so you are bound to get duds. People who have mental health conditions, poor EQ, commitment issues, and work ethic problems make up a huge portion of this group.

There're also many tiers of scholars, your president scholars, your PSLP general, your PSLP sectoral, your in-house ministry/stat board scholars, and your study awards. All have different ROIs attached to their profiles and their HR depts all have different ways of managing them. There is a chance to move between them, like ministry scholar ending up getting into the PSLP general phase. So even among scholars life is hard and competitive.

**Internship**

I see people recommending internships - these are a huge waste of time unless you make contacts and are able to convince people that you are talented. I was an intern at a few ministries before so I know. A lot of times you can't do real work, because you can't get the security vetting. So you just do the menial work for the full time staff. For us who have to manage interns, it's a headache too. We do the work faster and without the hassle of having to manage the admin.

So forgive us if we don't look keen to entertain interns or want to teach interns what it means to be full-time staff. If you are good though, it'll be a blessing. Some people are like that. At the end of the day, we are just looking out for people with potential and another recruitment channel.

But the pay's good, or at least the pay for interns I hear about nowadays. Make friends, get occasional treats from full time staff, and get a nice letter of recommendation/testimony.

To all interns, draft your own letter of recommendation/testimony and write it well!

**Advice for New Civil Servants**

As parting words, my advice to new civil servants - work your ass off, don't get comfortable in your job (leave if there's nothing left to learn), be meticulous, don't embarrass your bosses, be firm and decisive, always try to learn as much as possible in your first few years (instead of when you're already lao jiao, because you'd be condemned for not knowing simple stuff).

Selvaraj told The Sunday Times that even if the sum were halved, his client would still be unable to afford it.\n\n""There is no point making him bankrupt at 21. He has no assets and we cannot predict how much he will earn in the future,"" said Mr Selvaraj, who is from law firm MyintSoe &amp; Selvaraj.\n\n""Before proceeding to sue someone, the plaintiff should have considered how much (Mr Ting) has.""\n\nSince the accident in September 2016, the victim - housewife Ang Liu Kiow, 57 - has been unable to speak, read or write and needs help with eating, dressing and using the bathroom.\n\nShe and her husband Mr Leong are represented by lawyer Benedict Teo from Drew &amp; Napier. Mr Teo is acting on a pro bono basis for the family.\n\nSpeaking through his lawyers, Mr Leong, a contract worker making $2,000 to $3,000 a month, told The Sunday Times that more than $60,000 has been spent on Madam Ang\'s medical bills and the costs are increasing. Hiring a domestic worker has also added to their financial burden.\n\n""Based on the doctors\' assessment, (Madam Ang\'s) disabilities will always remain as she has reached the functional end of her incremental recovery,"" he said.\n\nThe father of three children aged 20, 26 and 30 is not giving up. The 57-year-old says he will explore other legal options, including taking Mr Ting to court to determine his assets or start bankruptcy proceedings against him.\n\nPersonal mobility device (PMD) riders are not legally required to be insured and cases like this one show that this needs to change, said observers.\n\n\nMr Nicholas Ting Nai Jie, the e-scooter rider who crashed into Madam Ang, said he is unable to pay the damages of $445,000 because he has no assets and was not covered by insurance. ST FILE PHOTO\nThere are already several insurance options for PMD riders, with one as low as $65 a year.\n\nMr Ho Kai Weng, chief executive of the General Insurance Association (GIA) of Singapore, said: ""This lawsuit shows clearly that the cost of insurance is far less than the cost of being uninsured.""\n\nThe accident involving Madam Ang was one of many during the height of PMDs\' popularity several years ago, when the devices were seen as a way to help commuters make the first-and last-mile segments of their journeys.\n\nBut as accidents increased, the authorities started with getting users to register their e-scooters before banning them from public footpaths. In the second half of this year, businesses that use PMDs on public paths, such as food delivery firms, will have to cover their riders with third-party liability insurance.\n\nIn February, then Senior Minister of State for Transport Janil Puthucheary told Parliament that the Transport Ministry was working with the Active Mobility Advisory Panel (AMAP) and insurers to see how to extend insurance to individual riders. There have been no updates since then.\n\nUntil such measures are rolled out, lawyers whom The Sunday Times spoke to said that in cases like Madam Ang\'s, there is little the family can do to receive the compensation due.\n\nDescribing Madam Ang\'s case as unfortunate, veteran lawyer Amolat Singh of Amolat &amp; Partners said: ""It is a hole in the system because we get cases like this where people have been hurt in accidents and there is not much that can be done if they cannot afford to pay and don\'t have insurance coverage.\n\n""(But) if we ask everyone to be insured for everything, like riding a bicycle or even roller skating, things will slow to a halt.""\n\nSimilarly, lawyer Amarick Gill said: ""The family can commence civil proceedings against the rider to get a judgment but at the end of the day, this is a tragedy. If he has no assets, the family will not be able to recover any of the money at all.\n\n""Such PMDs should have insurance coverage to prevent future mishaps.""\n\nIn the 2016 accident, Madam Ang was running errands in Pasir Ris and as she stepped onto the footpath by a bus stop, she was hit by the electric scooter. She fell, hit her head on the ground and later underwent emergency surgery for bleeding in her brain. In 2018, Mr Ting pleaded guilty to causing grievous hurt by a negligent act and served a short detention order of two weeks.\n\nPMD enthusiasts The Sunday Times spoke to argue that while insurance plans can help in some cases, they do not solve the root problem of PMD-related accidents.\n\nMr Denis Koh, a former AMAP member and chairman of the PMD enthusiast group Big Wheel Scooters Singapore, said: ""The priority should always be prevention. This leans towards education, to mould the community towards a more gracious culture to share the space harmoniously.\n\n""The insistence of just PMD insurance alone should not be seen as the sole solution, but it will have to kick in as part of the reparation process if someone does get injured.""\n\nMr Francis Chu, the co-founder of cycling group Love Cycling SG who previously sat on the AMAP, argued that having insurance as a shield may even cause recklessness on the roads.\n\n""I feel (being uninsured) has a bigger deterrent impact and induces more careful behaviour when riding,"" he said, suggesting crowd funding as a possible option for Mr Ting to pay the damages he owes.\n\nMr Leong said he is disappointed by Mr Ting\'s refusal to pay any sum whatsoever. ""I still get upset when I think of my wife\'s current condition. However, I refuse to lose hope and am determined to continue caring for her.""']"

So therefore we stock up a little bit, especially those fast-moving (items), whereby we want to keep about a month’s worth of supplies,” said logistics manager Ryan Chiam.\n\n&gt; These fast-moving items include blood tubes, needles and gauze, he said.\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; He was speaking during a media tour of the department’s storage facility at the basement in one of NUH’s buildings.\n\n&gt; MORE MANUAL WORK TO BE DONE\n\n&gt; The heart of the team of more than 50 staff members are the storekeepers. They typically do a physical check to find out what is needed by each clinic, ward or operating theatre and inform a team member, who then gives the go-ahead for these items to be issued.\n\n&gt; The storekeepers walk down rows and rows of items arranged according to their material group at the storage facility, loading up their trolleys while armed with a list.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; They then push these trolleys to the different destinations within the hospital grounds, and help to unpack and arrange the products in utility rooms. It is this manual work that has increased with the pandemic, as the need for replenishment comes faster.\n\n&gt; “PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) is something that we used to top up maybe two or three times a week. Now, we have to go every day,” said Mr Kenny Tang, who heads the team.\n\n&gt; Mr Tang said that many storekeepers have been with the hospital for decades, with half of the team aged between 50 and 68.\n\n&gt; “Being an old hospital, there’s very limited IT (Information Technology) solutions or technology that we can leverage on, so it’s still a very manual process."", he said.\n\n&gt; Storekeeper Nazarndi Mohd Abi (right) and store supervisor Abdul Wahap Mydin Pillay are involved in making sure their colleagues on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic are properly equipped.\n\n&gt; “It’s very hard on my staff. This is Kent Ridge right? The terrain is not a flat thing where you can go around easily.""\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; WORKING WITH A LEANER TEAM\n\n&gt; On top of that, the team also receives a higher number of urgent requests for supplies.\n\n&gt; Senior executive assistant Lim Chun Bin said that before COVID-19, there would be two to three such requests a day, but now there are about 10. There were also fewer items being requested then. Now, there could be more than 20 items being requested.\n\n&gt; “Usually they are requesting for those protective covers, like the gowns, the masks, and stuff like that,” she said.\n\n&gt; “The requests come in quite fast, so even on my non-working days, I also do check my email and try to respond to them,” she added.\n\n&gt; The team also provides supplies to support the medical teams providing care at foreign worker dormitories, and around 40 per cent of their COVID-19 related supplies like N95 masks, gloves and gowns go there.\n\n&gt; The increased workload comes at a time when the team on any given day has become leaner, due to split-team work arrangements. The employees work alternate days, including on weekends, and work longer hours each day. They are supported by temporary staff.\n\n&gt; The full-time employees now work from 8am to 9pm.\n\n&gt; ENSURING SUPPLIES EVEN WHEN IT’S DIFFICULT\n\n&gt; Other than performing more manual work, the team has also had to get creative in making sure sufficient supplies are kept on hand.\n\n&gt; Corporate gift vendors may not be the first to come to mind when trying to get a supply of face shields, but they are precisely the people Mr Tang and his team reached out to.\n\n&gt; Mr Tang said that they had to turn to “non-traditional” sources.\n\n&gt; While most of the PPE, like masks, was drawn from a national stockpile, there were some things, like face shields, that the hospital had to bring in on its own, he said.\n\n&gt; Among the 2,600 types of items the Materials Management Department is in charge of are needles, masks and blood tubes.\n\n&gt; “Face shields were one of those things that we needed to bring in quickly and at a time where everybody\'s trying to grab the face shields,” he said.\n\n&gt; With traditional medical supply vendors facing restrictions and export limitations, they relied on these gift vendors to get supplies from China, he said.\n\n&gt; Another issue during the pandemic has been an increase in prices for items like disposable pillow covers bandages, dressings and alcohol swabs, he said.\n\n&gt; “We are beginning to see vendors increasing their prices, and we are trying to manage them as well to make sure that, you know, any increase is reasonable,” he said.\n\n&gt; “Part of our responsibility is to manage the healthcare costs as well.”\n\n&gt; LESSONS AND MOVING FORWARD\n\n&gt; While it may not be possible to improve on every aspect of manual work, on the cards are efforts to include technology that can relieve storekeepers of at least some work.\n\n&gt; “We don’t have much technology … but we are going to introduce some to help relieve them so that they can be more efficient in their work,” Mr Chiam said.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; From this month, storekeepers will no longer have to physically go to wards to check on the level of stocks. The hospital is introducing a system which involves nurses alerting the department on low supplies through technology.\n\n&gt; “You will actually save so-called the manpower for this person to go to the ward to check stocks,” Mr Chiam added.\n\n&gt; “One of the key things we did is that now, we tried to collect more data, after going through COVID-19, at least the first few months,” said Mr Tang.\n\n&gt; Among the data is the utilisation of the PPE, which he believes will come in handy in the face of another pandemic.\n\n&gt; At the end of the day, Mr Tang is very clear on the role that the team plays in the hospital eco-system- an important one, even if it is not in the spotlight.\n\n&gt; “We fill the hands that heal. To me, these are six very meaningful words that describe what we do.”\n\n&gt; Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

This could be due to either ignorance, or - when enforcement officers are not around - ""simply because they can"".\n\n&gt; She added: ""I think in the beginning, most will be cautious when they venture out.\n\n&gt; ""However, when this is normalised and especially when nothing happens when we resume social activities, many may tend to let their guard down. So what we need is constant reminders, and rule enforcement to guard the boundaries.""\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; The scene at Jewel Changi Airport around 6pm on Sunday. While most Singaporeans are rule-abiding, there are always those who push the boundaries and take unnecessary risks, noted sociologist Pauline Straughan. ST PHOTO: KEVIN LIM\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Prof Teo said to stem such behaviour, public education is paramount, which means constant reminders of what is risky and what is not.\n\n&gt; ""By constantly being informed about the situation locally, this can help individuals to decide which activities are now permitted because the necessary precautions are in place to make it safer, which activities remain at a higher risk and therefore controlled, and which activities are strictly disallowed because the possibility of community transmissions in these settings is extremely high.""\n\n&gt; Equally important is cultivating a sense of restraint and control, he added.\n\n&gt; ""Forbearance, by individuals as well as by the enforcers of rules and regulations, is important,"" he said. ""If one does forget to wear a mask or abide by safe distancing regulations genuinely, it\'s important that the public and enforcers do not be too quick to castigate... But of course, if one is clearly recalcitrant, then penalties and sanctions ought to apply.""\n\n&gt; Related Story Fatigue with social distancing poses coronavirus containment challenge\n\n&gt; Added Professor Dale Fisher, a senior consultant at the division of infectious diseases at National University Hospital: ""We need to learn to live with this virus. This requires community behaviour to stay in line with all the guidelines and rules.""\n\n&gt; Another reason for the spike in cases in several countries is the lifting of lockdowns prematurely.\n\n&gt; Indeed, the World Health Organisation has stressed that countries should ease restrictions only when they have put in place adequate systems to track, trace and isolate all cases in the country.\n\n&gt; This has been a misstep in some countries. In the United States, for instance, in two-thirds of states, infections were rising when governors started to ease lockdowns, according to a report in The Economist.\n\n&gt; Singapore appears to have avoided this with its slow and careful entry into the new normal, carried out in phases and with the riskiest activities still on hold for now.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; National Parks Board staff watching out for violations of safe distancing rules at East Coast Park last Saturday. ST PHOTO: KHALID BABA\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; ""The pace of reopening in Singapore is quite reasonable, when you consider what has happened in countries that reopened too soon and too fast,"" said Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.\n\n&gt; ""This is especially so when you consider that we still have large numbers of cases being identified in the dorms, and the risk of spillover.""\n\n&gt; Related Story Coronavirus: Four infected people from Bukit Panjang Integrated Transport Hub cluster are all bus drivers\n\n&gt; Still, a cluster could happen any time and anywhere. The community cluster at the Bukit Panjang integrated transport hub, that was uncovered last Friday, is a case in point.\n\n&gt; To protect themselves, Singaporeans should be prudent and maintain a limited number of contacts during this period, Prof Teo said.\n\n&gt; He added: ""However, if one of your contacts is a social butterfly and continues to maintain a very diverse social circle, then clearly your risk is still amplified.\n\n&gt; ""This is why we keep emphasising that the success of keeping Covid-19 at bay depends on everyone\'s cooperation, to keep to the spirit of the regulations around social activities in order to protect the community.""\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; People flocked to the beach at East Coast Park last Saturday. ST PHOTO: KHALID BABA\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Just because an individual can meet up with four other friends during this period does not mean he should take advantage of this and meet up with many different groups of four others, he stressed. ""This is a privilege that can just as easily be rescinded if the Covid-19 situation in the community flares up again.""\n\n&gt; Related Story Fears of second wave in NY as the young socialise without a care\n\n&gt; Ms Lydia Lim, 24, who works in tech supply, has taken this advice to heart. She has been limiting her social interactions to two to three times each week, each time keeping to around two to three people.\n\n&gt; ""I think the circuit breaker has helped me to rethink my social interactions and prioritise the gatherings which I attend - and I think this will definitely change the way I spend my time in future,"" she said.\n\n&gt; • Additional reporting by Cheryl Tan\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"
141,singapore,255051,Singapore is a Meritocracy* [EXTRA LONG POST],i0fvw7,cherenkov_blue,1596084400,232,1,"Now that the 2020 General Election is firmly in our rear-view mirror, there is something that I have been meaning to write about: institutionalized racism affecting the minorities, especially the Malays, in Singapore. If you are groaning at this thinking you have been misled by this post’s title, I assure you that by the end of this post you will understand the caveat behind the above-mentioned title. I plead for a little of your time and patience.

We have seen many discussions online about majority privilege and systemic racism impacting the minorities. Many of you may have even participated in some of these discussions. I will not try to explain those terms for they have already been repeatedly debated to death. What this post aims to achieve is to bring to light Singapore’s history and government policies that have either benefited the majority race or kneecapped the minority race. Or both.

**Why am I doing this?**

It is frustrating to see some Singaporeans fully buying into the narrative that Singapore is a truly meritocratic society; that the government’s policies do not discriminate against minorities, or if a Singaporean worked hard enough he or she will succeed (whatever the definition of success is), or that we have anti-discriminatory laws that protect the minorities. Some even claim that the Malays enjoy special privileges due to Section 152 of the Constitution describing the special position of Malays, and that the Malays are blessed with free education in Singapore.

**Section 152, “Special Position”, free education for all Malays?**

&gt;[***Minorities and special position of Malays***](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963?ProvIds=P1XIII-.)  
&gt;  
&gt;***152.****—(1)  It shall be the responsibility of the Government constantly to care for the interests of the racial and religious minorities in Singapore.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*(2)  The Government shall exercise its functions in such manner as to recognise the special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people of Singapore, and accordingly it shall be the responsibility of the Government to protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote their political, educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interests and the Malay language.*

[The oft-mentioned Section 152 of the Constitution was an administrative continuation of previously existing colonial policy towards the Malays \[Col: 126\].](https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic?reportid=004_19900612_S0004_T0005) Regardless of the “special position” of the Malays, the only form of assistance rendered to the Malays was the policy of free education for all Malay students. This minimal approach of the government did little to improve the educational and socio-economic standing of the Malays as revealed by the 1980 national census. The free tertiary education policy was ultimately removed in 1990, [despite opposition from Malays who questioned the constitutionality of its removal \[col: 126\].](https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic?reportid=004_19900612_S0004_T0005)

**With free education for all Malays, why haven’t their socio-economic and educational standings improved?**

There are many factors to look at, and the issue goes way back to the colonial era so that’s where we shall start. The colonial administrators of Singapore, in their pursuit of capitalistic gains, had little use for the native inhabitants. The natives who were already living off their own land had no desire to work for the British as labourers. [The British saw this unwillingness to work for them as indolence, and ascribed many other negative cultural stereotypes to the locals \[pdf\].](http://www.citizens-international.org/ci2017/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/the-myth-of-lazy-native.pdf) Nailing home the capitalistic intent of colonial presence in Singapore, the British Director of Education R. O. Winstedt explained their [policy for education for the natives in 1920 \[pg. 2\]:](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/sbs19890520s.pdf)

&gt;""The aim of the government is not to turn out a few well-educated youths, nor a number of less well-educated boys; rather it is to improve the bulk of the people, and to make the son of a fisherman or a peasant a more intelligent fisherman or peasant than his father had been, and a man whose education will enable him to understand how his lot in life fits in with the scheme of life around him"".

And in 1915, a British resident revealed the [colonial attitude towards education \[pg. 3\]:](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/sbs19890520s.pdf)

&gt;""The great object of education is to train a man to make a living.... you can teach Malays so that they do not lose their skill and craft in fishing and jungle work. Teach them the dignity of manual labour, so that they do not all become krannies (clerks) and I am sure you will not have the trouble which has arisen in India through over education""

The type and quality of education that the British set up for the native inhabitants show that they had no intentions to empower the locals with skills for a new economy. The education provided, while free, was to make sure the locals were kept out of trouble for the British, and remain subservient to the colonial causes. Further impeding the socio-economic status of Malays, the British actively discouraged Malays in switching from agricultural production to more lucrative cash crops, preventing the building of wealth among the Malay communities (Shahruddin Ma’arof, 1988: 51). In contrast to the British suppression of the buildup of Malay wealth and provision of vernacular education, Chinese businessmen, clan associations and Christian missionaries established Chinese schools where students were taught skills like letter-writing and the use of the abacus. By the turn of the 20th century, the [curriculum in these Chinese-language schools expanded to include arithmetic, science, history and geography](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-10-03_094744.html) while Malay-language schools under [Winstedt’s educational policies focused on vernacular subjects such as basket-weaving.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1629_2010-01-30.html) 

**So, when Singapore attained self-governance, did things get better?**

Discontent with the education system and social inequalities was already a big issue in the mid 1950s that the parties that contested for the Legislative Assembly championed for reforms to social issues like [better education systems, housing subsidies and workers rights. ](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19550402-1.2.6)

The People’s Action Party (PAP) won the 1959 Legislative Assembly general elections by running on a rather progressive platform of [low-cost housing, improvement of employment opportunities for locals and a stronger education.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2019-04-08_145822.html) They also campaigned for abolishing the inequality of wealth in their election manifesto (Petir, 1958: 2), with PAP chairman Dr Toh Chin Chye expressing his disgust at seeing [“so many of our people reduced to living like animals because under the present social and economic system, the good things of life are for the ruthless few, those who believe that the poor and the humble are despicable failures.”](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19590429-1.2.4)

With the PAP in power, assurances were made to Singaporeans that no community would be left behind. In 1965, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew [promised aid specifically to help raise the economic and education levels of the Malays](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19650813-1.2.3). In 1967 during a mass rally at Geylang Serai, PM Lee again promised that [“the Government with the support of the non-Malays are prepared to concentrate more than the average share of our resources on our Malay citizens \[pdf\].”](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/lky19670611.pdf) He emphasized the importance of lifting all sections of the community to an even footing, reasoning that “if one section of the community were to lag behind it would harm the unity and integrity of the nation” (Bedlington, 1974: 289). 

Despite these promises to help the minorities narrow the inequality gap, very little was done to realize it. Instead, the government took a ruthless approach towards economic growth, sparing no expense. Deputy Prime Minister Goh Keng Swee explained the government’s main concern was “to generate fast economic growth by any and every possible means. . . . If unequal distribution of income induced greater savings and investment . . . then this must be accepted as the price of fighting unemployment.” (Goh, 1972: 275) 

By the late 1970s, a strong shift in parents’ preference towards an English-medium education for their children had resulted in a rapid decline in the number of vernacular schools. 

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, there was a shift of parents’ [preference towards educating their child in the English stream.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-09-01_093402.html) This shift, together with a period of minimal intervention in terms of educational policy and assistance to the minorities by the government, caused the [number of enrolments in vernacular schools to rapidly decline.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-10-03_094744.html) The socio-economic gap also widened between the Malays and Chinese, as the Chinese community enjoyed greater occupational mobility relative to the minorities. This can be seen in the shift in the lower manual occupation category, from a relatively equal proportion in 1957 to a 10 percent difference in 1980 \[Table A\]. In 1980, the average Malay household income was only 73.8 percent of the average Chinese household income. The income gap widened considerably by 1990, where the average Malay household income dropped to 69.8 percent of the average Chinese household income \[Table B\] (Rahim, 1998: 19-22). Decades after the lofty promises were made by the government, the Malay community’s slide into marginality continued.

[Table A](https://preview.redd.it/d9g2s726bxd51.png?width=1626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a99fe9bd8c37a06d51b75c01f8428fa3a0c5b7d0)

**Wait, the gap got bigger? Did the government do anything?**

In 1979, Education Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee with the Education Study Team released a report on the Ministry of Education, more widely known as the [Goh Report.](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/data2/BookSG/publish/6/6614bee6-52e9-458f-8f89-4c1a9b0529e6/web/html5/index.html?opf=tablet/BOOKSG.xml&amp;launchlogo=tablet/BOOKSG_BrandingLogo_.png) The team was made up of 13 members, most of them systems analysts and economists, and none of whom ‘possess much knowledge or expertise on education’ (Goh Report, 1979: 1). The all-Chinese team excluded social scientists and educationalists, as the Education Minister had little regard for their expertise (Rahim, 1998: 121). The Goh Report made recommendations for radical changes to the educational system, recommendations which then became the basis of the [New Education System (NES).](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2017-11-01_135530.html)

During a time when Tamil, Malay and Chinese schools were getting closed down due to declining enrolment numbers due to the popularity of English medium ones, the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) was introduced in 1978 to [preserve and develop nine Chinese schools into bilingual (Mandarin and English) schools while retaining the values and traditions of a Chinese school.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-07-21_154021.html) As part of the NES, these schools were to be the only ones to offer the Special course which the [top 10 percent scorers of the PSLE are eligible to opt for.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2017-11-01_135530.html) With these schools getting [more resources, better facilities and the best teachers](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19890321-1.2.2), the SAP contradicts the multi-racial principle of giving equal treatment to the non-English language streams. This exclusivity and the elite status of SAP schools affords its students better opportunities and advantages that are virtually out of reach for many minorities in Singapore. Effectively, the SAP is an institutionalized form of ethnic/cultural favouritism (Rahim, 1998: 130)

The NES also introduced [early streaming for students](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2017-11-01_135530.html) which further exacerbated existing inequalities. Despite primary school education being free for all Singaporeans, [families with better financial means have a huge advantage in preparing their child for streaming through additional tuition and better preschool choices#.](https://doi.org/10.1080/14631360500226606) (Barr &amp; Low, 2005: 177) As we have seen from the disparity in household incomes between the Chinese and Malays, early streaming served to widen the gap between the haves and have-nots. The have-nots, more often than not, find themselves in the lower streams, trapped with very limited options providing upward social mobility. They will have to face an insurmountable task to lift themselves and their future generations out of their current predicament.

In 1982, the PAP slogan [“a more just and equal society”](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/lky19600224.pdf) was quietly dropped from the [party’s constitution](https://www.pap.org.sg/party-constitution/). This signaled an end to the socialist ideals that the party built its identity upon.

**Why? It can’t be that the government favours one race over another...can it?**

Examining the PAP leadership’s attitude towards the different cultures and ethnicities is key to understanding what the government values and how these values shaped its policies. Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, as quoted in the Goh Report, extolled the values of East Asian philosophies: [""The greatest value in the teaching and learning of Chinese is in the transmission of the norms of social or moral behaviour. This means principally Confucianist beliefs and ideas, of man \[sic\], society and the state""](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/data2/BookSG/publish/6/6614bee6-52e9-458f-8f89-4c1a9b0529e6/web/html5/index.html?opf=tablet/BOOKSG.xml&amp;launchlogo=tablet/BOOKSG_BrandingLogo_.png&amp;pn=9) (Goh, 1979: v). The government’s championing of SAP schools and ‘Chinese values’ is also complemented by the launch of [‘Speak Mandarin Campaign’](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2013-07-04_122007.html) in 1979. 

In 1991, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong espoused similar values as his predecessor, praising the virtues of ‘Confucian dynamism’ and claiming that [Singapore would not be able to thrive and prosper without the Confucian core values of thrift, hard work and group cohesion.](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/gct19910726.pdf) The fear of erosion of the Chinese cultural identity was never matched with a similar concern for the erosion of minority cultural identities, where the minorities were [“expected to submit to a form of partial or incomplete assimilation into a Chinese-generated, Chinese-dominated society.#”](https://doi.org/10.1080/14631360500226606) (Barr &amp; Low, 2005: 167)

On top of favouring Chinese cultural values and identities, the PAP leadership associated the cultures of the minorities with negative connotations. Speaking about a Malay who did well in business, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew described the man as [“acting just like a Chinese. You know, he’s bouncing around, running around, to-ing and fro-ing. In the old culture, he would not be doing that”](https://graphics.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/ebooks/LKY_The_Man_And_His_Ideas.pdf) (Han, et al., 1998: 184). In a Straits Times article on 26 June 1992, SM Lee also implied that the Chinese are inherently better at Maths, and that [""If you pretend that the problem does not exist, and that in fact (the Malays) can score as well as the Chinese in Maths, then you have created yourself an enormous myth which you will be stuck with.+""](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Issue/straitstimes19920626-1)

These attitudes from the ruling elite translated into more policies that preserved the advantage of the majority. When faced with the “pressing national problem”\* of a declining birth-rate of the Chinese, the government took steps to ensure Chinese numerical dominance in Singapore. The Singapore government encouraged the immigration of skilled workers from countries like Hong Kong, Korea, and Macau, countries which were accorded the status of ‘traditional sources’ of foreign labour (Rahim, 1998: 72). Meanwhile, showing the government’s preference and/or dislike for specific groups of people, Malaysian Malays faced great difficulty in getting work permits. ([“‘Harder’ for bumiputras to get S’pore work permits.+”](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Issue/straitstimes19910307-1), The Straits Times, 7 Mar 1991)

Another policy which worked to preserve the advantage of the majority was the [urban resettlement programmes of the 1960s and 1970s.](https://www.psd.gov.sg/heartofpublicservice/our-institutions/housing-a-nation-building-a-city/) This resulted in the dissolution of the Malay electoral strongholds in the east, undermining the organic growth of Malay political grassroots. When it became apparent in the 1980s that the Malays were moving back to the traditional Malay residential areas, [an ethnic residential quota, labelled the Ethnic Integration Policy, was implemented.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/d8fea656-d86e-4658-9509-974225951607) The rationale behind the quota was to ensure a balanced racial mix, purportedly for racial harmony. However, this rationale does not stand up to scrutiny in the face of numerous academic studies on interethnic urban attitudes and relations\*\*. Another consequence of the policy is the [reinforcement of racial segregation when taking into account the income disparity between the races.](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/gia/article/multiracial-singapore-ensuring-inclusivity-and-integration) Underlining the weakness of the government’s reasoning, constituencies like Hougang were allowed to remain Chinese residential enclaves despite its population being approximately 80 percent Chinese. (Rahim, 1998: 73-77)

Perhaps the most controversial policy introduced was the Graduate Mothers Scheme. It was introduced in 1983 to reverse the [trend of falling fertility rates of graduate women versus the rising birth-rate of non-graduate women\*\*\*.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19861215-1.2.32.3) In a push to encourage graduate mothers to get married and have children, Deputy Prime Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee unveiled a suite of incentives; [all-expenses paid love-boat cruises for eligible graduate singles in the civil service, a computer dating service, fiscal incentives, and special admissions to National University of Singapore (NUS) to even out the male-female student ratio#.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45130834) At the other end of the spectrum, lesser-educated women were encouraged to have smaller families in a scheme called the Small Family Incentive Scheme. This was achieved by paying out a [housing grant worth S$10,000 to women who were able to meet the following set of conditions: be below 30 years of age, have two or less children, educational level not beyond secondary school, have a household income totalling not more than S$1,500 and willing to be sterilized#.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45130834)

Based on the average household income statistics, a simple deduction could be made that those eligible for the sterilization programme were disproportionately from the minority communities.

**Isn’t that eugenics?**

Yes. [Singapore had a government-established Eugenics Board.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-11-09_103740.html)

The graduate mothers and sterilization programmes were [greatly unpopular and were ultimately abandoned or modified](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/did-mr-lee-kuan-yew-create-a-singapore-in-his-own-image) after the PAP’s mandate took a [12.9 percent hit in the 1984 general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Singaporean_general_election). However that did not mean that eugenics stopped being an influence in policy-making. 

In his 1983 National Day address, PM Lee stated that when it comes to intelligence, [“80 per cent is nature, or inherited, and 20 per cent the differences from different environments and upbringing.”](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19830815-1.2.30) This is telling of the role that eugenics, biological determinist and cultural deficit theories played in the formation of PAP policies.

To further safeguard Singapore from “genetic pollution” (Rahim, 1998: 55, [Tremewan, 1994: 113](https://b-ok.asia/book/3307827/16b78c)), the Ministry of Labour in 1984 issued a [marriage restriction between work permit holders and Singaporeans.](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/269-1984-07-07.pdf) The work permit holder would have his work permit cancelled, be deported and be permanently barred from re-entering Singapore if he were to marry a Singaporean or permanent resident without obtaining prior approval. Approval from the Commissioner for Employment would only be given if the work permit holder possesses skills and qualifications of value to Singapore. 

**Doesn’t sound to me like the government targets any particular race with its policies.**

Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in 1987 rationalized that [certain posts in the Singapore Armed Forces had been closed to Malays for ""national security"" reasons.](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19870720-1.2.22.26) He claimed that this policy was implemented to avoid placing Malays in an awkward position when loyalty to nation and religion came into conflict. PM Lee also added that the [Malays behaved more as Malay Muslims than as loyal Singaporeans.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19870720-1.2.22.26) PM Lee and DPM Lee’s statements finally made explicit what many suspected to have been an implicit rule. It could be observed that, despite being overrepresented in the civil service, Malays tend to stay in the lower-to-middle rungs of organizations like the SAF. It is also noteworthy that, to date, no Malay has held important Cabinet portfolios such as Minister of Defence, Minister of Home Affairs, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Minister of Trade and Industry. 

The conflation of loyalty to the country with approval of the ruling party proved to be patently flawed, as [studies by the Institute of Policy Studies](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/docs/default-source/ips/cnp__pol_part_survey_media_release_slides_300710_circulation2.pdf) (ST, 30 Sept 1990: 22; IPS, 2010) indicate that Singaporean Malays showed a stronger sense of national pride and identification compared to the other major ethnic groups. The study also found that Citizen-Nation Psychological Ties (CNP) scores, that is, national loyalty, weakens with: higher socio-economic status, Chinese, youth, and political alienation. Even when the Malays have been historically disenfranchised, they were found to be proud to be Singaporeans, loyal to Singapore and more willing to sacrifice for the nation than the other ethnic groups.

Additionally, Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong [threatened to withhold aid to the Malay self-help organization Mendaki in 1988.](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880924-1.2.24.27) The threat was issued over an incident during election night where several Malays in a crowd of Workers Party supporters had jeered at PM Goh at a vote counting centre. It became apparent from this incident that [any aid offered by the government was tied to loyalty to the PAP instead of it being the duty of the government to serve Singaporeans regardless of party affiliation\^\^.](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880929-1.2.37.1.1) 

**There have always been Malay PAP Members of Parliament (MP), did they not help fight for these issues?**

The Malay PAP MPs are in the unique position of having to represent not only people of their constituents but also the rest of the Malay Singaporeans while toeing the party line. With many of the government policies being unhelpful towards the Malays, it is near impossible to fulfill this role satisfactorily. PAP MPs Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah) and Sha’ari Tadin (Kampong Chai Chee, Bedok) were both made to enjoy early retirements from their political careers for bringing up “sensitive” issues of the Malay community\^\^\^. This set the tone for future PAP Malay MPs to remain unquestioningly in step with the leadership, regardless of their personal agreement, in order to have a long career within the party. Today, Malay PAP MPs have continued with the trend of parroting PAP policies that ran against the interests of the Malay/Muslim community (e.g. [Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/masagos-criticises-faisal-for-raising-divisive-issues) and [Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/allowing-hijab-problematic-some-jobs-yaacob) with regards to the *tudung* issue).

**What about the Mendaki and the Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy (TTFS)?**

The policy providing free education for all Malays was ended in 1990 despite [opposition from the Malays and the opposition party\[Col: 126\].](https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic?reportid=004_19900612_S0004_T0005) In its place, Mendaki introduced TTFS in 1991 to subsidise the cost of tertiary education in local institutions for those living in low household income. Due to the long history of marginalization and the widening of the inequality gap, the number of Malays who were able to make it to tertiary education institutions, especially in local universities, have been disproportionately low compared to the other ethnic groups. As such, the number of students able to benefit from this subsidy is even lower. 

It was only recently, 20 years after the introduction of the subsidy, that the criteria for eligibility underwent revision. [The revision takes into account the size of the family of the applicant, allowing for more Malay students to benefit from it.](https://www.mendaki.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/TTFS%20FAQ%202020_revised14Feb.pdf) However, this subsidy is only one measure in an attempt to ensure that Malays students who were able to qualify for tertiary education are able to do so. Short of totally ditching streaming, more care, thought and resources are needed to lift the quality and accessibility of education for the Malays, especially in the [early years of a child’s education.](https://doi.org/10.1080/14631360500226606) 

**So what needs to happen now?**

Singaporeans, especially politicians, need to move on from making assertions similar to what PM Lee had made in 1987, that the [""problem is psychological  . . .  if they try hard enough and long enough, then the education gap between them and the Chinese, or them and the Indians, would close. . . .  Progress or achievement depends on ability and effort.""](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19870707-1.2.33.3) It is important for Singaporeans to recognize the nearly Sisyphean task faced by marginalized communities in improving their socio-economic standing. Handicapped right from the start, their perceived failures in our “meritocratic” society should not be judged as an indictment of their efforts, but influenced in no small measure by the failings of the state in dragging their feet to take action. As a community, Singaporeans need to actively combat negative stereotyping, and move away from policies that were rooted in eugenics. Government intervention into ensuring unbiased, fair hiring practices would also help in raising the standing of the marginalized minorities. It would be impossible for Singapore to live up to its multiracial, meritocratic ideals without making fundamental changes to the above mentioned policies.

*\*\* From Lily Zubaidah Rahim’s* The Singapore Dilemma *(1998: 76-77): Rabushka’s (Rabushka, Alvin (1971),* ‘Integration in Urban Malaya: Ethnic Attitudes Among Malays and Chinese’*, 91-107) study found that it was common for people living in ethnically homogeneous areas to adopt favourable attitudes towards other ethnic groups. People who resided in ethnically mixed areas but did not mix with other ethnic groups were also found to hold negative attitudes towards others. He postulated that physical proximity coupled with superficial interaction across ethnic lines may in fact lead to heightened contempt for other ethnic groups. Urban studies (Fischer, Claude (1976),* The Urban Experiment*) have similarly found that close physical distance of different ethnic groups does not necessarily result in narrowing the social distance between the communities. Indeed, physical ethnic proximity in large cities may well engender mutual revulsion and a heightening of ethnocentrism. These research findings have been corroborated by several Singaporean studies (Hassan, Riaz (1977),* ‘Families in Flats: A Study of Low Income Families in Public Housing’*; Lai, Ah Eng (1995),* ‘Meanings of Multiethnicity: A Case Study of Ethnicity and Ethnic Relations in Singapore’*) which have found interethnic relations in the ethnically integrated public housing flats to be relatively superficial.* 

*\*\*\* In the same article, PM Lee drew a straight line connecting the Malays with lower educational levels in this line of rhetoric questioning: “Why is the birth rate between the Malays, and the Chinese and Indians so different? Because the educational levels achieved are also different.”*

*\^ The stronger representation of Malays in civil service and Western multinational corporations was likely due to the difficulty in seeking employment in local firms. Prevalence of negative stereotyping of Malays meant that a Malay job applicant has to be much better qualified to be considered for a job in a local firm (Rahim, 1998: 25). A recent study into this phenomenon can be found* [here#.](https://doi.org/10.1017/prp.2019.9)

*\^\^ The PAP’s quid pro quo policy was put under the spotlight again in 2011, when PM Lee made it clear that the* [*government’s neighbourhood upgrading programmes prioritised PAP wards over opposition wards.*](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/pm-lee-don-t-upgrading-pay-less-tax-20110405-231901-526.html)

As regards the issue of Malay rights to free tertiary education, my feedback is that the majority of Malays are unhappy with it.

Article 152 of the Constitution, inter alia, states quite clearly that the Government recognises the special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people of Singapore, and that it shall, amongst other things, support the educational interest of the Malays. Free education to the Malays has been part of our life since the colonial time. The PAP Government took office in 1959 and later on we became independent in 1965. Throughout this period up to the present day, the Malays in Singapore have enjoyed free education up to tertiary levels. In other words, there is implementation of this part of our Constitution by the Government. And in accordance with the British constitutional law which we inherit, the carrying out of that part of the Constitution over time has made it become part of the Constitution by convention and practice. Therefore, it would appear that the Government\'s attempt to take away free education of the Malays is unconstitutional. It is a breach against well-established convention of the Constitution.

Premised on this logic, PAP Malay MP Harun Abdul Ghani advised the Malays that ‘trailing behind the Chinese does not mean that the Malays are losing out.

143,singapore,251437,[Trigger Warning] Singaporeans who fell through the cracks of society... How are you now?,hrorgl,momochan14,1594824012,374,69,"**Economic downturn is here and more Singaporeans will fall through the cracks. I hope we can share our experiences with each other.**

**Here goes my story...**

Ever since early 2000s, my family struggled financially after my father was retrenched, due to the economic downturn. No companies wanted to hire him, despite his experience and capabilities, because he was deemed too old (in his 50s) and over-qualified for junior roles, couldn't even get past the recruiters.

After my father's start-up attempt failed, he took up any jobs possible that barely keep us afloat (Warehouse Executive in the day, Cook at fast food restaurant at night), because if he didn't, we would not be able to cover HDB loan, bills, debts and other expenses. He put up with the bullying from his boss (heavy workload, deducting his pay whenever something goes wrong) because he really needed the job. When he went to Social Services for financial help during the most desperate times, he recounted that the process was very demeaning and felt like a beggar. We got some financial aid, but it was far from enough.

Prior to that, I was blessed to have had resources (for enrichment classes, tuition etc..) for development, went to good schools and received good grades. As a result, my parents pinned high hopes on me that I would be the one to ""rescue"" the family, that kept them going during the difficult times. During the worst period, we nearly lose our home and had no money for our meals.

During my JC years, I was giving tuition to earn my pocket money. My parents didn't know I was struggling inside, I couldn't tell them, they had already crumbled under the immense pressure. They were miserable and started buying 4D, because they thought they could buy ""a hope"", they were happy only when they strike. I was crumbling under their heavy expectations, stress of going hungry, sense of shame from not having enough money to eat, maintaining my grades in a top JC. I was exhausted and had no one to confide in, even though I had people to hang out with.

I was falling into depression and couldn't absorb what I was studying. As expected, I didn't do well for the A levels, that sense of failure spiraled me further into depression. (I internalised the stigma of seeking therapy, because I thought the record would become a obstacle in my future, and if I hang in there, it would go away) My parents told it was ok, but I know it's not from the way they behaved,

I refused to go down like that, I started working while my friends enter Uni. I thought I can save enough and pay for my own education (no one could be my guarantor for school loan), I was very clear about what my strengths are and what to study. I survived on less than $5 a day and enrolled in part-time degree after work. My mother would ask me for money for family expenses from time to time, I would give it to her to see her worry less. I was pushing myself very hard, lack of sleep and irregular meal times, my physical and mental health deteriorated. I went to Feiyue for free counselling service, the counsellor was kind but the only thing he could advice me, was to leave my family. It's impossible because I couldn't afford anymore financial burden to myself (rent. get my own household items etc..).

One day, my mother told me my father was going to get into big trouble, if I didn't help him pay off his debt. I didn't have the heart to let more misfortune befall him. I was totally crushed, that was my last straw. Even when I worked so hard to save, I couldn't study as I wanted, all my savings gone, just like that. I was very dejected and lived like a zombie, my parents said I should pull myself together and pressured me to do something productive.

&gt;!I couldn't take it anymore, the pain was just too overwhelming. I was standing by the window, almost ready to take a dive. My sibling pulled me off the window, we hugged and cried. I know I need professional help immediately (because if I don't, there is no future to talk about).!&lt;

I went to the polyclinic and got a referral to see a psychiatrist at KTP Hospital, diagnosed with depression and given medication. Experience with my doctor was poor, he was uncaring and insensitive, but I carried on, took my medication because it worked for me. I asked if there was any support group I could join, he said ""nope"" and that was it.

I returned to work after I felt ready again. I had a hard time looking for a job, the recruiters questioning about the gaps in my resume, the tone as though there I did something wrong. I was especially afraid of a section on the form that requires me to declare whether I have any mental illness. (thankfully this section is no longer around) When I finally found one, I cherished it and did my best, got praises and then the bullying from co-workers started. I hanged on and stood my ground, but gradually it took a toll on me, and my depression relapsed. I told myself that I have to fight the right battles in life, and I quit my job.

This break is the turning point in my life, as I started going for psychotherapy and working out issues that I had. **I strongly recommend anyone who is suffering from any trauma to seek therapy ASAP, don't bottle it up until it becomes debilitating, because the body keeps score and it will always win.**

I'm in recovery and felt better than before I had depression, with a newfound understanding of myself. I convinced my parents to seek help for gambling addiction, and the financial situation improved. I am very proud of them for doing that.

However, I'm struggling with fears of being asked about the gaps in my resume when I apply for jobs, how people feel about working with someone with mental illness. Now in my early 30s, my struggle is far from over, I have problem finding a sustainable job without degree, and now I also have to worry about my parents' medical bills. I want to love and marry someone, have my own family, but I don't think I can afford to do so (My bf of many years broke up with me because he saw no hope in my situation).

A very big part of my life revolved around my personal battles that I cannot put onto my resume to add value, and too afraid to tell others because I don't want to be labelled as a failure by societal standards, or that I'm trying to get sympathy. Life is about spending time with your loved ones, having enough food to eat, a place to stay, doing meaningful work. I still want to work towards it.

I don't know how the future will turn out for me, I'm lost now. I was unemployed before Covid-19 hit, and did part-time job on and off, now my source of part-time jobs is gone too. I don't dare to sign up for jobs that has a lot human contact, because I'm afraid of passing the virus to my 2 elderly parents. I am trying to self-learn digital design (through free courses), and now I heard market is bad.

Most women her age would be in their first jobs, struggling to pay off their student loans in jobs they hate, let alone have time for a baby or to fight for social justice.

Since she had financial backing, she was able to do charity work, volunteer, run for parliament and fight for social justice. Simply because her basic needs were satisfied.

With UBI, people can choose to pursue more worthwhile jobs and causes rather than just working to ensure their existence in this world.

People could choose to be artists, musicians, philosophers, entrepreneurs, innovators or inventors rather than food deliverers, admin staff or PHV drivers since their basic needs are taken care off.

The argument against it would be that the middle class and the rich do not need UBI. Instead, they would be spending their UBI and contributing back to the economy, also known as the trickle down effect. To enhance this further, you can even give people an option to opt-out and let them use the UBI as a form of income tax relief, maybe even giving a 50% bonus of the UBI not used!

Even with minimum wages, people will still find ways to abuse the system such as comcare receipts who ensure that their income does not exceed the limit. With UBI, people would still want better lives for themselves and continue to climb the corporate ladder if they wish to do so. Human greed is insatiable and they constantly want more.

146,singapore,250466,Is it legal to criticize the state as a concept? How far SG laws can be applied to abstract political economy?,hppxmm,omgcoin,1594536029,53,1,"I lived in five countries and considering to relocate to SG. It feels it's the only major country left with high degree of economic freedom since HK days are numbered.

I'm aware of political climate in SG and its strict laws. I wonder if laws like POFMA can severely limit me, especially given my exotic political views.

I will try to briefly describe my views, what I read, and what I'm going to write myself. I'm interested to know if it would be considered unacceptable according to SG laws. I'm not going to engage in political discussion here.

Namely, I'm passionately advocate for stateless capitalism as the only logically consistent version of capitalism. Other names of this ideology: anarcho-capitalism (terrible name), libertarianism (bad name), private law society (good name), polycentric law (good name).

It's okay and it's expected if your reaction is like - ?!?!?!?!

Here is an example of what I read:

https://mises.org/library/state-or-private-law-society

Quotes:

&gt; The state, according to the standard definition, is not a regular, specialized firm. Rather, it is defined as an agency characterized by two unique, logically connected features. First, the state is an agency that exercises a territorial monopoly of ultimate decision making. That is, the state is the ultimate arbiter in every case of conflict, including conflicts involving itself. It allows no appeal above and beyond itself. Second, the state is an agency that exercises a territorial monopoly of taxation. That is, it is an agency that unilaterally fixes the price that private citizens must pay for the state's service as ultimate judge and enforcer of law and order.

&gt; If an agency is the ultimate judge in every case of conflict, then it is also judge in all conflicts involving itself. Consequently, instead of merely preventing and resolving conflict, a monopolist of ultimate decision making will also cause and provoke conflict in order to settle it to his own advantage. That is, if one can only appeal to the state for justice, justice will be perverted in the favor of the state, constitutions and supreme courts notwithstanding.

Here is what I'm going to write:

I do feel that advocates for stateless capitalism often skip quite a few steps when making arguments. They skip steps as they think it's obvious to everyone (including statists). However, as ex-statist, I do feel it's their greatest weakness. So I want to write an article to close a few important gaps. For example, it took me a while to dig into literature to understand how negative externalities (like air pollution) should be resolved in stateless capitalism and it's not obvious at all.

Here is what I'm not going to write:

I'm not interested to publicly criticize PAP or its specific policies. Anyway, this field is already overcrowded, there is nothing really new to contribute.
I'm not going to write things like - abolish the state now! Anyway, legitimacy of the state exists in the heads of majority of people. Even if the state cease to exist today, there will be a endless fight among armed groups to build a new state. That is failed state doesn't not equal to stateless capitalism. I believe it's impossible to build radically decentralized political system without convincing majority of population. I also don't believe that it's possible to do so when the state works relatively well (like Singapore or Norway).

I think it's fine to write theoretical works about the nature of the state. However, given how crazy current situation in HK, I should double check if SG government is adequate.

148,singapore,250152,What most parties objective will be until the next GE.,hp9fw6,giantvariety,1594471765,11,1,"This is my personal view and I am taking this as status quota (Means no major scandal/event that might swing the vote drastically to the other side till the next GE)

# PAP

Main objective: Repositioning to be more acceptable/connectable to the younger generation.

Reasons: Most of the people that ride the LKY hype train is reaching their EOL, the younger generation that are less likely to vote due to nostalgic value. The results of the Sengkang GRC show that the younger generation are willing to take the risk by voting in opposition. Thus their need to reposition.

Secondary Objective: Accessing who is their powerhouse(anchor) in the 4G Roster

Reasons: Their 4G roster major player is supposed to be HSK which narrowly won the East Coast GRC. If the opposition managed to find more star players like Jammus Lim/Nicole Seah, they stand a high chance of losing the Supermajority once the 3G leaders were to step-down.    


# WP

Main Objective: To maintain the existing area and slowly expand from them

Reasons: Even though they won Sengkang GRC, they will not want what happened in 2015 GE to repeat. The ideal result for them is to win with a margin similar to 56% to 44% in the next GE. This will enable them to use it as a foothold to nurture candidates up to contest for other GRC and SMC.

Secondary Objective: Nurture 2 additional high profile candidates to field in MP and EC GRC.

Reasons: HSK moves to EC most likely spoiled WP initial Plan to take it. However, by having another high profile candidate fielding with Nicole Seah, it might force PAP to move more of their ever-shrinking A tier players to prevent PAP from losing their foothold. Possible Tharman Shanmugaratnam might move to East Coast if HSK fails to impress the public.   
Having a high profile candidate that can be their anchor in East Coast, is likely to do the same effect, lessen the PAP star power that could carry unpopular candidates in other electoral divisions.  

# PSP

Main objective: Becoming a long term and solid opposition party in the political arena.

Reasons: For a new party, they perform relatively well. The fact that they nearly won WC GRC and did put up a good fight proves that the citizen do not view them as a joke. Now they must solidify their position in the public view and prove that it is not a fluke for them. 

Secondary Objective: Finding a new face for the party

Reasons: Now everyone is likely voting them due to wokeness(firepower) of TCB. However, TCB is relatively old (80) thus they are required to have a new face of the party to ensure continuity as stated in the main objective.

# SDP

Main Objective: Continue to do what they are doing with Dr. Chee and Dr. Paul.

Reasons: They gained a lot of ground during this GE. Moreover, as the demographic of the population start to change, this will likely help in their flavor and they stand a relatively better chance of winning the 2 SMC. If Dr. Chee wants to, I think moving towards a younger estate might boost his odds even higher.

Secondary Objective: Change the main face of the Party to Dr. Paul in order to change the stigma regarding SDP 

Reasons: Dr. Paul is likely more popular than Dr. Chee with older audiences due to the events that took place as Dr. Chee younger days. By putting Dr. Paul as the face, they stand a higher chance of capturing older audiences which is possibly the Bane of Dr. Chee career. Dr. Chee could be positioned to capture the younger target audiences due to the way he presents himself.

GE2020 had 899 polling districts, so for simplicity I created 90 SMCs with 10 districts each (Except Tampines East with 9), so each SMC should have roughly equal population.

I also prioritised making the districts look compact and nice, no strange extensions like Jurong, Marine Parade or Aljunied. It's not perfect but I'm really happy with how this turned out.

the utter shithole state of US politics is partly because of the lack of civilised clash of ideas. People began to look at personalities, statuses and identities and forgot about substance of arguments. People forgot to assume the best of their opponents. The other side cannot be just honestly and sincerely wrong. They must be deliberately spreading falsehood. They must be morally deficient. They are guilty by association. They are bad people. They are traitors.

Many ‘conservatives’ are afraid of “woke” culture but ironically POFMA is Cancel Culture perpetuated by the government. WP’s goals on being rational and respectable is crucially important, because it’s easy to rile emotion and get caught in our own foolishness. Although dismissive and unproductive methods of persuasion are not particular to any group, big P Progressive ideals being the zeitgeist of the time together with social media generally being used by younger crowd makes the movement prone to devolving into an echo chamber and misjudgement of the popularity of the ideals. If the way which POFMA and Section 298 is used is undesirable, in the future whoever has the power and perceived moral legitimacy must remember to avoid falling into the same trap. 

It is extremely challenging to create and maintain constructive discourse. Some young just go “oh, boomer” some old just go “entitled millennials”. Or the classic bogeyman “The West”. (Our national language, political system, penal code, economics and education are largely “Western”) Is Singapore in a good place to be a model example and cultivate a healthy environment for uncomfortable conversations with its largely civil and educated populace?

151,singapore,250066,“Is this a repudiation of the political culture of bullying?” - well-written afterthought on the election by Thio Shen Yi from TSMP law firm,hp79mg,Newez,1594459979,26,1,"From Thio Shen Yi FB account:

Is this a repudiation of the political culture of bullying?  

Is it my imagination, or did the WP, of all parties, take the high road? No smears, no attacks.  Grace, humility and ability to apologise and learn, and a listening ear. 

Some of the PAPs candidates are magnificent. PM, Tharman, Nadia Samdin(disclosure- colleague alert- congrats!). Lawrence Wong has had a good run, Chuan Jin and Iswaran show themselves to be gracious and gentlemanly, Indranee is a charm offensive unto herself and able to change minds through a combination of logic and more importantly, empathy. Tin Pei Ling and Patrick Tay clearly work the ground and win hearts and minds. Some PAP names are still untested or not well known to me, or are perceived to not listen, or to be arrogant and mean spirited. 

The PAP run a country well. They run a campaign terribly (a shout-out to Stef for stealing her line). My two cents worth:

1. You are the majority- take the high road. People expect it. You are held to a different standard. That is neither illogical, illegal or unfair. Dominance has its responsibilities (like Competition Law). 

2. Stop bullying candidates. Stop attacking them. Play the ball, not the man. Trust us to distinguish between good and bad ideas. We don’t like to see those in power beat up those outside looking in. Support for the underdog resides in all our hearts.

3. Be humble. I never saw a response to AWARE’s objection to a rather tasteless analogy about the wife beater analogy. Learn to apologise. People respect that. You will say something tone deaf or offensive. It is inevitable in the heat of the moment. You will get called out. Walk it back. Don’t double down. Say sorry. Express regret. We respect that, and that humility wins us over.  

4. Don’t insult us. Our feelings, our intelligence or our aspirations. “Don’t worry about voting in all 93 PAP MPs - there will be 12 NCMP seats to ensure representation”. That is neither convincing or persuasive. Some see an NCMP, and there is a “loser” sign on their forehead. That is not what legitimacy looks like. Don’t tell us “own self check own self” works. That would be unacceptable in almost any form of organised public activity or corporate life. Why would we accept that in political life, where the stakes are the highest? 

5. Understand what we want. We want you to run the show.  But you clearly don’t need 100% of the seats to do that. You could run this country effectively if you lost 25 seats. You’d have 68 seats. Yes, you would have lost some talent.  That forces you to partner and co-opt more ideas, you need to foster inclusivity, and encourage an active citizenry to step up. Groupthink is checked. You have to kick around ideas more- even consult your political opponents! But would that be so bad? 

6. Don’t fearmonger.  The LKY playbook is antiquated. Strategies for a time when the stakes were existential. It worked then, it is toxic today. We can survive because your predecessors have built a strong Singapore and a strong people. We have talent, energy and passion all around us. It just needs channeling by appealing to a collective stakeholdership, a real sense of ownership, and a solidarity or purpose. It’s there. If you think it isn’t then the last 50 years are a failed experiment where we have sowed the seed of failure even in our success. Reject that. Choose to believe we are better. 

7. Be scrupulous in designing a fair playing field. Again, we aren’t stupid. We can see when things are not fair. The desire for fairness is a psychological default. Many won’t speak out- speaking truth to power is fraught with hazard. But resentment will build up. It’s more than a lost vote. It’s more than a civilised disagreement. Resentment means a disengagement of the citizen, a division of the soul and a rebellion of the heart against you. Why encourage that? 

8. Fight bad ideas with good ideas. Fight falsehood with truth. Don’t rely on over inclusive tools like POFMA (or other statutes). That’s using a flamethrower against an ant. Even where there is falsehood, have a sense of proportion. Some falsehoods are truly egregious, and truly dangerous. Others are more debatable, and still more others are marginal and will get lost in the noise of  the hustings and excreted in the wake of information overload. Overuse, asymmetrical use, and disproportionate use of POFMA irritates the neutral observer and is a deep condescension to our intelligence. 

9. Think better of us. When you tell us that Singaporean’s are not really for a non Chinese PM, what is the basis for that?  Do you have a poll? Or is it anecdotal? It feels that you are impugning our moral sense with a racism that isn’t substantively there. Yes, humans are tribal, but after 50 years, do you not think we can rise above that.  Have you so little faith in the better angels of our nature? Maybe you do, but why default to it?  
Require better of us. And what does it cost you? A few votes from older Chinese voters ( assuming that that is even true)?  You may win over other voters with your openness and inclusiveness. When did doing what is right, even though it is not popular, stop you? 

You are trying to win hearts and minds. So it goes beyond logic. Legitimacy is built from emotional capital. It is not only about performance (what that looks like is another discussion!). Fairness, credibility, loyalty, passion, aspiration, understanding, unity, authenticity, warmth, respect, inclusiveness. Build on that.

The results for this GE were somewhat within my expectations, except I wasn’t expecting Seng Kang GRC to be lost to WP. But it was a close call. 

I am glad to see that my Opposition supporter friends are happy. While the loss of Seng Kang  GRC would shock some PAP supporters, it does not provoke quite as much anger overall compare to the scenario where PAP swiped all the seats (which was not impossible).

On the other hand, if PAP had lost either East Coast or West Coast GRC, #die. 

I consider this a good outcome for the country. 

**Natural evolution of the system, hardly landmark.** 

Some had claimed that this was going to be some landmark GE and there’s this huge swing against the PAP. I disagree.

If we look at the voting trends over the past 2 decades, it would be clear that the Opposition has been gaining ground steadily over the past 2 decades. 2015 was an anomaly. Everyone (PAP and Opposition) all knew that it was the “LKY Effect.”

What we have seen this GE is that “LKY Effect” has worn out, and the fact that the vote share has gone up a little higher than in 2011, suggests that there’s still some amount of “flight to safety” given the COVID19 crisis (maybe?).

In any case, vote share is also not a good measure of the population’s approval of the PAP because it should also be clear that there is a large segment of “swing” voters in Singapore who do not fully identify with any Party (which is a v v good thing). 

The quality of the candidate actually matters for some and people do not just vote along party lines. I consider this a feature and not a bug. We will have serious polarization if everyone just blindly picks a side. It is this group of middleground “swing” voters who are the real check on the Government. If our politics goes the way of the US, we are doomed. Furthermore, we are seeing more and better quality Opposition candidates during this latest GE, so PAP’s vote share will naturally drop also (as long as voters are not polarized along party lines). 

**Holding the Middleground**

Let me be v blunt. These middleground “swing” voters are the real checks on the Government, not Opposition MPs.

If we divorce the politics from the actual governance, our public policy making is still v sound. The Opposition will not be able to bring anything new to the table. All the proposals they suggest would have already been considered. Where the Government is found wanting is the inability, or perhaps lack of willingness (basically cannot be bothered), to explain to the people. I could probably have done it singlehandedly except nobody is paying me to do it. 📷:-) 

Policy innovation happens occasionally, but it is extremely rare. Think COE and Progressive Wage Model (PWM). Workfare was not bad, but it’s not entirely innovative in my view. 

If I am right, then the natural question is: why do we need politicians? Why don’t we just get rid of the whole bunch of them and save taxpayers money like the Opposition seems to suggest.  After all, the civil service can more or less keep the country running? 

The problem with good governance is that it is like bad-tasting (good) medicine. What is good for the country at large will probably not be popular. 

Because money does not grow on trees, the Government has to decide where and how to spend our tax dollars. The civil servants do a lot of work to make projections and analyze the various options. I have no doubts that our public servants do their best. This also their country. They also don’t want to screw it up. However because money is finite, some trade off will need to be made and some segment of the population will be unhappy. So, what is the job of the politicians?

To hold the ground and ensure that the Government has the **moral authority** to make hard decisions. PAP politicians, you had that one(!) job. :’(

Given how politics has been evolving in the US, my fear for this country is polarization, as people start to take sides and politics becomes tribal. I hope that people will stay centred.  Just because PAP is fronting some unpopular policy don’t assume that they are wrong; if the Opposition is touting something that sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Please all watch this [video](https://youtu.be/fLJBzhcSWTk). 

**Repentance Not Yet Forthcoming**

It was terrible for the PAP that the call for “repentance” leading to the loss of Aljunied GRC in 2011 was largely forgotten after the LKY Effect in 2015. 

It is a mystery to me why the PAP doesn’t seem to have figured out that a heavy-handed and bullying form of politics does not work with the modern electorate. 

The Constitutional amendments for the Presidential Elections was v ugly. It boggles my mind why the PAP would want to burn precious political capital. If TCB was allowed to become President (he is more or less a harmless old man. People think he wouldn’t agree to allow Government to tap reserves for COVID meh?), the PAP also wouldn’t have had to contend with PSP and almost risk losing West Coast GRC. 

Amendments to the NCMP scheme were actually quite benign. Essentially, the political system is just evolving into something that is closer to [Proportional Representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation), which I actually think is a good thing. If some 30% of the population supports the Opposition and there are only 5 Opposition MPs, something also doesn’t seem right lah. Unfortunately, the PAP went to politicize it by saying that people no longer have to vote for the Opposition.

I also thought that POFMA was a mistake. I initially supported POFMA because fake news is a real threat to democracy. Unfortunately, implementation is policy and the clumsy manner in which POFMA has been exercised has not won the PAP too many fans. My main concern about fake news would be instances where people spread fake news that can cause riots and social unrest, but unfortunately, in those instances, it does not seem POFMA goes far enough. In my view, POFMA isn’t working. The Government should go and review it and either repeal it or amend it in some way, so that it actually achieves some good.

Sadly, I don’t think that the PAP has improved on its brand of politics since 2011. In fact, I believe that it has gotten worse since 2015. :’( 

It’s cool to be a prof ‘cos I get to chat with these young people all the time and they teach this dinosaur many new things. Thank you. Anyhow, there was this boy (he’s not \*that\* young anymore. Just always young to me), who was sharing me these really insightful observations. So naturally, I asked him, “wow, you can be the next wonderboy for the PAP!”

He was incredulous. He told me that I must be kidding. He said to me that while PAP is doing a decent job, it’s brand is so bad that it’s unsalvageable.  The PAP might want to chew on this feedback. 

In this current day and age, talent is king. WP has managed to build a really formidable video team for this GE. Kudos to them. If the PAP does not clean up its act, its hegemony will eventually be threatened just because it will no longer have the **moral authority** to attract the top talent to join its ranks. Perhaps that’s already the case, but it could get worse. 

**Hitherto Whereto**

As we look forward to the future, it is also good to reflect on the past and I went to dig up what I wrote for the past 2 GEs: here, here and here. The conclusion is that not a lot has changed, unfortunately. :’( 

A friend who is a long-term PAP supporter pinged me and asked me: “how ah? At this rate, we’re going to have a change of Government in 2 GEs!”

While I am not convinced that the Opposition is ready to form a Government and I suspect the Opposition will still not have the people it needs to form a competent Government in 2 GE’s, I don’t think that it’s like a given downward trend as long as the PAP just **focusses on governing the country and avoids making unnecessary Constitutional amendments**. On POFMA, I would like to be charity and give the Government some slack. There is a real problem. Unfortunately, the solution wasn’t good. 

What is clear from my past notes also is that there are longstanding grievances that the PAP has not addressed. Some policies might have been made to address certain issues, but those policies have not be communicated and explained adequately to the electorate. The PAP needs to take a leaf from Jacinda Ardern. She’s like the best thing since sliced bread as far as politics goes for the Western world. However, I don’t believe that she’s an LKY by a long shot. She just has really good showmanship. 

Singaporeans are a pragmatic lot. In fact, I think this latest showing will help the PAP in the next GE, as the prospect of a “freak” election becomes more real. Nobody really thought this round that it was plausible for the PAP not to form the Government.  There will be some amount of push back. The Opposition is also likely to get complacent and the PAP will be forced to work harder. My assessment is that the long term steady equilibrium for this country will still be a PAP Government with a minority Opposition (and I think that the Opposition will likely continue to gain a bit more ground over the next few GE’s since they do have \~40% support). 

PAP supporters please do not think that this GE is some kind of a disaster for the PAP, or for the country. 

It is not. 

But the PAP better go and find time to repent when it finds a break during our fight against COVID over the next couple of years.

On this note, I hope that we can all put this GE behind us and unite to overcome the present crisis.

My fellow Singaporean, please take COVID19 seriously. Not just the healthcare risks, but really have to brace ourselves for the nasty economic fallout. Seriously, not play play one--and be fair to the PAP. This one is really act of God and not the PAP’s fault. After we survive this massive economic tsunami, we can start squabbling again. 

Majulah Singapura.

I have talked to many of my friends and relatives who lives in the GRC and shared thoughts.

The only fear they had for not voting for the opposition was **the risk of losing Singapore's next PM** and possibly bring about the demise of Singapore because they voted out the incoming PM and did not want any blood on their hands. And this is coming from the older generation of voters, which goes to show that EC could have been a blue area if not for the HSK's move.

Yes I'm still salty about the HSK move from Tampines to EC, but it would take a lot of effort on HSK's part to prove his place in parliament and keep his seat, or he might accidentally get left behind, as shown from the close fight he had to face despite being the subsequent PM which should have been like AMK GRC.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hp56hj/thoughts_from_an_east_coast_grc_voter/,1.0,"['&gt; the risk of losing Singapore’s next PM\n\nDon’t worry, even if HSK didn’t win a seat, there are ways to get him in as the next PM.']"

157,singapore,249798,Post Election Thoughts,hox3tn,Esterence,1594414838,61,1,"Some thoughts immediately off the top of my head.

1) Turnout was higher this time round despite COVID because everyone is really unhappy with the govt.

2) Opposition need bigger unity if they wants to make a bigger in road. WP has a strong presence in the east now, I expect them to make further inroads with EC and also take on new places like Tampines for example. PSP has strong presence in the West (finally a credible party there) and will probably take down WC next time round the very least and also Marymount. Worth nothing every single seat they contested they had high 30s at the very least. This means PSP is already respected in just their first campaign. 

SDP has made further inroads in central-west areas but they need more quality. They currently only have 2 credible ones in Dr Paul and Dr Chee as evident by their results. If they worked hard in the ground for the next 5 years they will probably win those SMCs over. Overall these are the only relevant opposition parties in Singapore, the rest of the parties (sorry SPP) need to disband or join forces with a stronger one to stay relevant. It is also obvious there's no room for those motley crews to be playful and fight these credible ones or they will lose deposits like at PR GRC. Singaporeans recognise opponent candidates these days more than olden days as it is now a new generation of educated voters who are not swayed by gutter politics or fear tactics. Almost every single opposition seat that has quality has seen close fights. 

3) PAP need to reflect and stop pushing blame like on voter's feelings. It's clear Singaporeans are no longer taken like fools and crap like POFMA and minority Presidency turns off many people. Oh and of course CCS admitting that they took us like fools and gamed the election timings don't help too. The 4g leaders are so bland and devoid of real charisma/quality they seriously need to find more people with diverse backgrounds and not just SAF personnel with no work experience parachuted as MPs. I would really really love to see them play fair politics from now onwards, no gutter ones (like the 3 disgusting press release they gave where personal attacks, terrible analogy and racial assumptions were made). Get rid of GRCs and make it a fair fight. If you work hard and do well on the ground you shouldn't need to game the electoral system to win. Voters do recognise good PAP mps like Sun Xueling, Tin Peiling, Grace Fu etc which continue to have very strong votes. If you put people and Singaporeans first everyone always win. Admit your mistakes and don't hide. When you apologise and vow to improve everyone has time for you.

4) Please have more constructive debates in parliament. Stop giving condescending replies like ""whats the point of your question"" or laugh silly to legit questions just because you can't answer. Very happy to hear LHL says how opposition leader Pritam will have more resources to work with now. This is how healthy politics should be like, for the better of Singapore. 

5) Opposition ward never falls once they take over. They almost always improve their % in normal elections once they take over the ward because of how well managed it is and how hard they work in connecting with all the residents in the estate. Will be interesting to see if this young team in SK can improve their share % next time round for further evidence. 

6) New generation voters is coming up. Everyone is more educated now and think carefully of voting, less of blind voting these days like the older generation who are less educated and more apathetic. It will be a different ball game to fight in the next GE. 

7) Opposition candidates quality are key. Voters have shown that they are likely to have a leap of faith as they deem fit when the opposition has quality candidates. Even West siders votes have swung massively. 

8) Stop gerrymandering? Like I said make it a fair fight. Let Bukit Panjang be there and not at Holland Bukit Timah, let hougang be hougang and not amk grc etc. Draw proper boundaries in accordance to their estate.

9) This time election process was really terribly managed. Please prioritise people's lives and don't call for an election during a pandemic just to win more votes.

(Credit: David Kiu on Facebook) 

I rarely post on FB apart from the odd vacation post, mainly because I believe everyone is entitled to their point of view and I seldom see the need to share mine. I’ve posted on climate change, conservation and similar topics in the past because these have enduring significance and impact and I thought important enough to share some views. The elections this coming Friday will also be an event of enduring impact in Singapore, hence I thought to post some thoughts.

I can understand the many grievances that have been voiced against the ruling party. Certainly much of the unhappiness is real. Life is a rat race from the time we go to school, throughout our working life and even post retirement as we need more funds given we live longer lives now. Even after slogging, there is no iron rice bowl and things continue to get more expensive and life continues to get more competitive, with foreign talent in our schools and workplaces. It can feel like life is neither good nor fair. Has the ruling party really done a good job? Have they lost their way? Do they have our best interests at heart? Do they listen, or know what is really needed? Do they deserve the vote for the next five years? Should we hand the reins to the opposition? Will they do a better job? Will having more opposition voices make things better? These are legitimate questions. Ultimately everyone needs to come to a conclusion about these questions for themselves this Friday because we are voting for the future of our families. The below is just my personal view about five grievances I’ve heard championed by some of the opposition parties in some form or other.

First, is a grievance that life is getting tougher and the government has failed us. On this, I think it’s worth remembering that it is a fact that Singapore is a tiny island nation with no resources. One that could easily become irrelevant to the rest of the world. This one fact means we are destined to hustle. It means we need to carve our own relevance. It means we need to force the rest of the world to want or need us. That means working harder and smarter than everyone else so others don’t eat our lunch. If you want to be a Singaporean, there’s no escape from this reality.

To be Singapore is to constantly fight for relevance. It doesn’t matter which political party is in power or what the balance is in Parliament, life will never be easy in Singapore because of this fact. If you want an easy life, you have a better chance emigrating as many have done in the past. It doesn’t cost anything for someone to paint a picture of an easier life to win votes, and it is tempting to believe it is possible. But you had better be sure because if you buy into it only to realise later you’ve been sold a pipe dream, it will be too late to earn back the hard fought position and relevance that has taken decades to build. I generally view with suspicion anyone offering an easy solution for an easier life because that’s just irresponsible and ignoring the reality of our circumstances.

Second, is a grievance that the system is not equitable or that we don’t have enough social mobility. There are many different variations of this grievance and it manifests in unhappiness with ministerial salaries, or in the tuition epidemic, or in “elite” vs “neighbourhood” schools, and so on. Some of this resonates with me. My heart breaks every time I see an elderly person having to sell tissue paper or collect cardboard. This is not the Singapore I want.

The truth is that there is indeed social and income inequality in Singapore. But this is also evident in every society. You only have to look at the waves of protests around the world in the last few months to know this. For us, we came from a society that was equally poor a generation ago, so any progress from that point will by definition be more unequal. My parents were not graduates but their children, my sister and I, were both able to graduate and find good jobs, thanks to their hard work to provide for us. Not everyone was as lucky. More can and should certainly be done to make sure that no one is left behind and that everyone has a chance to move up.

To close this gap, there are only three ways. Lower the penthouse, raise the basement, or build a lift. Lowering the penthouse is generally a bad idea as it is a disincentive, so we are left with the other two options.
Both will require the government to be able to invest more which requires that we can continue growing our economy. Without that, we will never be able to afford the social investments and mobility we need. To dish out more from a shrinking pie will just cause the pie to shrink faster. Anyone can say that we need to invest more in this or that. But the reality is that you cannot have more investment in education, in healthcare, in social assistance, in innovation, all at once. Social investment is one area where the community can and should do more rather than just rely on the government. I generally view with suspicion anyone who tells me I can have my cake and eat it, because you can be sure you will be charged for two cakes later.

Third, is a grievance that the government has allowed too many foreigners to compete and take jobs at the expense of equally qualified locals. This is a delicate issue. Most of us at some point have probably thought to ourselves, “I could have done that job just as well or better, so they must have hired that other person instead because he/she was cheaper foreign talent or they hired their own (assuming the hiring manager is also foreign).” We rarely think, maybe we are not competitive or not hungry enough.

The fact is that companies are just looking to hire the best person for the job at the best cost, regardless of the nationality. And increasingly also regardless of the location. I’ve never heard of a company wanting to hire a less capable and less qualified person who is also more expensive. I probably wouldn’t want to work for a company like that anyway as it won’t last too long. As many people have now been working remotely for several months, companies are also realising that many jobs can be just as easily performed in Singapore, or Mexico, or Egypt, or Rwanda, or any number of places where the quality could be just as good for a fraction of the cost.

So to force a company to hire a Singaporean in Singapore at several times the cost yet at the same level of capability will more likely cause jobs to leave Singapore and result in fewer opportunities for everyone here. The only true solution is not to force companies here to hire more expensive Singaporeans, everything else being equal, but to help Singaporeans become the best candidates. Or else we go back to the first scenario, that Singapore becomes irrelevant and unnecessary.

By all means ensure that companies hire fairly and give jobs to equally qualified locals. But would anyone really want to be hired even though they are the worse candidate, just because they are local? Some countries do that but that is not a road that leads to sustainable competitiveness. I generally view with suspicion anyone claiming to be able to protect my job for me, because generally no one can do that for you if you don’t do it for yourself.

Fourth, is a grievance that we need more diverse and dissenting voices to ensure checks and balances (aka no blank cheque), and give more voice to those whose interests are not represented. This is quite a fashionable point of view, because it sounds appealing in theory to have more scrutiny or debate.

The strange thing to me about this though is that those that claim to offer this rarely really offer any view that is not already being heard. Just because the final decision is not one that represents the minority view, doesn’t mean that the diverse views were not considered or consulted. In the end, no decision can make everyone happy and the job of the government is to make the best decision for the majority, while continually listening and taking into account the needs of the minority. In the pandemic response for instance, the first wave of support did not do enough for self-employed persons and this feedback was heard and addressed in subsequent waves.

Indeed, it feels more likely that the opposite risk is more worrisome, which is that of creating populist politics that force governments to make decisions that pander to vocal minorities or provide temporary benefits, at the expense of long term interests or the silent majority. Or worse, prevent governments from making unpopular decisions for the long term benefit of the majority because of the loud voices of the vocal minority.

After all, a tax hike may be the right thing to do but will never be popular and not having a strong government to push such policies through will mean that we shy away from the tough decisions needed. Imagine if the government does not receive a strong mandate. Then the next time they are faced with a potentially unpopular but right decision, they will naturally think twice because it could cost more votes. Would we want a government that avoids making tough decisions even though they are the right ones?

What we actually need is a government that really listens well and makes policies that benefit the majority of the people for the long term. Having more opposition doesn’t necessarily create this. It is created by strengthening the institutions that represent these interest groups, whether it is the arts, or SMEs, or religious groups, or others. Some of our NMPs for example have done a great job of this. I generally find suspicious anyone asking for votes solely on the basis that they can be a check and balance, because it usually means they are not really bringing anything else valuable to the table.

Fifth, is a more recent argument that the new generation of leaders in government is not as capable, evidenced by how the COVID response has apparently been a failure, and then that somehow this is proof that a parliament with more opposition would have done better. On the COVID response, there are certainly opportunities to improve but I believe the fairer characterisation is more success than failure. Could we have locked down earlier, or introduced quarantine earlier to prevent imported cases, or acted earlier to stop the dormitory spread? Maybe. All great with hindsight.

But looking at the current situation around the world, I struggle to find examples of any other countries that have performed better in managing this crisis. I for one would rather get COVID in Singapore than anywhere else in the world. We are not yet out of this but I am certain when we look back after all the dust has settled, we will find that what we have accomplished is a rare feat that most countries will be envious of.

One personal anecdote. The company I work for has opted to return or refuse COVID related government relief funds all around the world, on the principle that these funds would be better spent helping others in more need. While working on this, I found that nowhere in the world were relief funds disbursed as quickly or without the burden of red tape, as it was in Singapore. While others were still scrambling to work out what to do, Singapore had already put money into people’s hands.

Would it have been as fast if we needed to debate every aspect of this in parliament? Would a parliament with more opposition resulted in a better or faster outcome? I struggle to see how this could happen. I generally view with suspicion anyone promising improved speed or better outcomes without showing how they would achieve this, because words are cheap.

During election season, it’s normal that opposition parties come out with campaign promises that criticise the status quo and promise an attractive alternative. No one will vote for you otherwise. I don’t blame the opposition parties for appealing to these grievances. It’s just the nature of politics.

It’s difficult sometimes to try to address these grievances because the feelings are real and that needs to be acknowledged rather than made to feel invalid. When the ruling party does this, it creates a sense that they are disconnected or not listening by trying to tell people you should not think or feel this way.

Hard truths are difficult to tell, especially during election season. It doesn’t make you popular or win you votes. But these grievances and arguments need to be examined closely to also remove the false promises behind them. That’s the job of the voter, distinguishing between the empty promises of those appealing for your vote, and real policies that will make life better.

In my mind, one test is this. If we rewind the clock to the start of the year, would I trust any of these opposition candidates to do a better job? Some of them were already in parliament so actually the question is, if we had a few more of these other ones, would I feel more comfortable and confident? Or less? During a crisis is when we most need the best government we can have. There is no bigger crisis than the one we are still in.

As I said at the start, ultimately each of us must come to our own conclusions. Our earlier generations have worked hard to put us where we are now. At the very least, we owe it to them, to ourselves and to our families to reflect on our choices and be sure for ourselves which is the mirage and which is truly the oasis.

164,singapore,247966,The NCMP scheme and why it may (not) matter.,hlhmn5,nooooblet,1593928271,20,1,"All views are my own. And all statements are opinions. 

&amp;#x200B;

The dynamics in this election is rather different from those of the past. Aside from the changes caused by the covid-19 situation, the campaign by the incumbent seemingly dismisses the need for opposition support since “there will be at least 12 opposition MPs, more than there are now.”. This references the constitution amendments made in 2016, allowing NCMPs to now have the same rights as other elected MPs. This includes rights to vote on constitutional matters and money bills. The party line has been repeated by no less than prospective members of parliament Indranee Rajah, Lee Hsien Loong, Teo Chee Hean, Chan Chun Sing and retiring Mr Goh Chok Tong.

This left me puzzled. Who gets to be an NCMP? What can he do? Should I care?

**Who are NCMPs?**

At first glance, one might think “oh golly, what a dumb question, isn’t it common knowledge that the ‘best 12 losers’ get to be an NCMP?”. Unsurprisingly, the answer is no. It is not that simple. 

Firstly, aside from being the ‘best loser’, the prospective member has to garner no less than 15% of the votes in the constituency he ran in. This highlights that giving the incumbent a “strong mandate” doesn’t guarantee “opposition voices in the house”. 

Secondly, this rule only kicks in when there are less than 12 (elected) members of parliament not belonging to the party forming the government. 

But of course, getting into the house is just the first step. What can NCMPs do once they are selected? 

**Can an NCMP represent me?** 

Dr Teo sums up this up perfectly, “there will be at least 21 alternative voices in parliament”. Voices. 

The NCMPs will be able to speak up for you and represent views – aside from the incumbent’s – in parliament. But in no way will NCMPs be able to affect policy.

It seems to me that supporters of the NCMP scheme have forgotten to do the mathematics. With over 90 seats up for grasp, does an NCMPs vote count? To pass a bill 50% of the votes are required, or slightly less than 60 votes. To change the constitution, 66% of the votes (less NMPs) are required or about 70 votes. Turns out, the changes made to the constitution in 2016 didn't grant any real powers to NCMPs. 

Whenever the NCMP scheme is in effect, NCMPs – and the opposition, for that matter – are simply dogs with lots of bark and no ability to bite. 

What is left unsaid is: NCMPs are ineffectively representing no one. 

**What does it mean for me?** 

The truth of the matter is the NCMP scheme does matter. Otherwise, founding Mr Lee would not have allowed the scheme to pass in the house. Otherwise, the current Mr Lee would not have allowed the scheme to have increased in scope. Otherwise, the opposition would have denounced and rejected the seats when offered to them. 

**Why it matters for the incumbent.**

As the late Mr Lee famously said (and is often misquoted), “Without the opposition members, the younger team has no sparring partners. They need real sparring partners to keep fit and agile.”. Having alternate voices in parliament does matter, it ensures that a third party evaluates the proposals made by the government of the day. It also ensures that ministers, when representing Singapore at the international stage, have had practice defending our policies, our country. 

**Why it matters for the opposition.**

Despite their criticisms of this scheme, it too gives them a chance to spar against the government, testing their policy suggestions. However, the benefit for the opposition goes much further. 

Having representation in parliament gives them the opportunity and outlet to air their views and alternate suggestions at a national stage, think of it as a marketing tactic for the news general election. It also lends them credibility, we – the people, are given the opportunity to observe and rate their (potential) performance in parliament before we decide to give them a chance at representing us. 

Look at the Workers’ Party’s field today, Ms Lim was once an NCMP, as were Mr Giam, Mr Yee, Mr Tan and Mr Perera. The only NCMP who has not returned to run as a candidate is Professor Goh, citing health reasons. We know their names, their faces and their positions because they have been given a platform to make their presence known. 

**What matters for me. And why it could matter for you.**

Firstly, do I support the NCMP scheme? No. 

Despite garnering the highest percentage of votes, this does not represent the largest number of supporters. Just take for example a losing candidate in Hougang and Potong Pasir SMCs. With 26,548 and 19,740 registered electors, 40% of Hougang voters is a much larger base than 45% of Potong Pasir voters. Is it fair that a candidate with less supporters enter parliament on the basis of the size of the constituency he chose to run in? 

Recall the 15% rule? This is probably important, as it prevents individuals who have been rejected by the public from speaking in parliament. However, the same logic should be applied to all candidates who fail to garner sufficient support from the people. Allowing candidates who have not received the largest vote share to enter parliament mocks our first past the post system. 

Secondly, would I prefer my opposition candidate to accept the NCMP role should he be offered one? Certainly! 

The NCMP role gives opposition hopefuls something to fight for. In a climate where we can almost certainly say the PAP will return to form the government, the NCMP position ensures that the opposition in Singapore does not disappear into obscurity. 

Not unlike the Workers’ Party’s buy one get one free campaign with regards to People’s Association representatives, the NCMP scheme does provide us with a buy one get one free situation. Dual representation for a single constituency in parliament, who could ask for more? 

Should you support the NCMP scheme? Well, that’s up to you. Regardless of your view, your vote counts, your vote is secret, your vote cannot be wrong.

165,singapore,247704,"On ""being too loud""",hkybbz,CodrutaStefanceau,1593841640,12,1,"I write this post after seeing quite abit of comments (on many forms of media) on how people who are on the fence or believe that they're moderates get pushed away by a loud opposition comments, etc. I thought it would be something interesting to explore and therefore this post.


There are two things I hope to explore here:

1. Why do people find ""loud"" opinions annoying

2. How should opposition supporters, in light of (1) pitch their case and arguments against an undeniably skewed playing field?


Full disclosure, I'm a strong opposition supporter, first time voter, although probably been ""moderate"" for at least the first 22 years of life. I've not been super active on social media, till recently all I post about (only at most 3 times a day) are election related. I used to hold the view that nobody likes things put in your face, and being told how to vote and how to think all the time. In a sense, I shared the view that if you're too loud, you push moderates away.


But I've had alot of time to reflect upon this. WHY was it that I felt annoyed by particular posts, more than others? Like it's not restricted to electoral politics, but it includes other issues from social to economic etc. It has to do alot with your preset biases and willingness to confront and reevalaute them in light of an argument proffered. At the end of the day, YOU CHOOSE what you want to believe and what arguments you want to hear. You generally have a tendency to stick to your original guns and the things that annoy you are things you actually initially disagree with. But are those positions correct and why so? 


Are you annoyed by being being too ""loud"" or are you annoyed at the position that they're taking or the reasons that they're taking a position? At least in my experience I've always found them to be the latter rather than the former. 


For example, I used to find ""SJWs"" annoying because they keep on going about social justice. It was only upon actually reflecting upon what's wrong with what they're doing, that tbh I've no good response. Perhaps the real answer is that I like to pretend many things in SG are perfect and that SJWs and NGOs are just naysayers and shit stirrers (which is unfair when so much of their time and energy is spent critiquing injustice). 


Ofc it depends on the context and I'm over generalising. And certain posts you don't need to think too much. Theres some outright xenophobia and racism in some things that people say that you waste time and energy confronting that. And ofc lastly to each at their own pace. Politics can be deeply personal and frustrating - people who don't like politics by definition hold a particular political attitude - and you shouldn't need to engage all the time, and nobody can force you too. Social media detox and self care applies regardless.  


The second point is distinct from the first. I'm painfully aware of how opposition supporters can be seen as ""too loud"" for a variety of reasons, and it's a very natural response in SG especially when views might not be publicly challenged. But I'm not sure how else one would try and change perceptions and convince others on politics other than talking to people and putting out (what I believe are fair) opinions, and risk alienating some moderate voters while convincing some, or just let the dominant narratives go unchallenged when this narrative is less likely to grate simply because it is what we are used to?

This post is meant to instigate discussion so I hope everyone will be able to keep it civil. 

Having watched several rallies by both opposition and incumbent, theres one key difference I noticed that is non-quantifiable. 

Opposition, regardless of their (shitty?) policies, have heart. as i've said, this is unquantifiable. there's just something about PAP candidates that is drone-like and monotonous. regardless of grc/smc, you're getting the same shit from all of them. they lose individuality. 

In my personal opinion, I find opposition party's speeches to contain much more 'heart'. it feels like they have a cause to fight for and they're not just saying the things they say to woo voters. it is apparent in our pathetic political system that if you even slip up, you will have your life ruined. (see Chee Soon Juan)

If you are on the fence of who to vote for, think about this. in your grc/smc, your pap candidate is bringing nothing new to the table. by them losing their seat, you have nothing to lose. your stability remains because for the foreseeable future, PAP will hold the majority. no ""unpopular policy"" by opposition will pass without the pap's approval which you so inherently trust.

What do you have lose by voting opposition? in my eyes, nothing. This is a discussion and I'd like to hear your opinions on what you'd lose by voting opposition. 

IMHO, the pap has too much power. They are able to pass any policy they see fit, willy nilly, without anyone questioning them. they control pofma so anyone raising questions that they dont like will think twice about even raising said question so they dont end up like my personal role model, Chee Soon Juan.

Even if there may have been, they will be laughed at and overall treated as a joke because “how can men be disadvantaged in society right?” “Stop whining and man up!!!!”

These are a few examples on how men have been systematically(?, not sure if right word don’t POFMA) disadvantaged.

\-NS. I know this has been repeated for very long. But I feel that people who have not served NS do not understand the true impact on mens careers. Why would any rational company hire a male who has 2 years less experience compared to all of his foreign and female peers AND has to “waste” 2 weeks of precious work time reducing overall company productivity. They will obviously want to hire foreigners or even better females so that they can score diversity points and get benefits from hiring a singaporean.

1. one is a 25 year old local grad, 0 years experience, asking for x salary  
 
2. Another is 26 year old foreigner, college grad, 3-4 years experience and asking for x salary  
 
3. Another is 26 year old non-ns female, college grad, 3-4 years experience and asking for x salary plus playing the Women In Tech card and gender diversity card  
 

Why would anyone hire 1???

In todays super competitive world, isn’t this an EXTREME disadvantage? Moreover, the NS pay is literally peanuts, barely enough to pay for food.

Even more examples (100% credits to u/appletree911

These phenomena are not merely just socio-cultural but are perpetuated by truly sexist legislative and institutionalised policies.

For instance, male preschool teachers are often subjected to abjective limitations with regards to internal gender-specific protocols devised by such institutions. They are not allowed to perform routine care (showering, changing of diapers etc) and have tight restrictions with regards to their physical interactions with children. Conversely, female staffs are not subjected to these limitations. Both genders went through the same training, possess the same qualification and demostrated competence executing their functions, and yet these male teachers are systematically side-lined, solely by virtue of their sex.

In Singapore, it is undeniable that females are accorded more rights and protection whereas males are burdened with more liabilities. Let me list some of these examples. Bear in mind that all of these are not merely ambiguous social protocols but legislated and institutionalised policies.

S375 of the Penal Code

The offence of rape is gender-specific. A woman cannot be charged with rape, regardless of how heinous a sexual misconduct she commits.

Amendment to S376 of the Penal Code

Prior to Jan 2020 (before the recent criminal law reform), a woman who 'rapes' a man (forces a man to penetrate her with his penis) cannot even be charged under S376 (sexual assault involving penetration). Hence, she can only be charged under S354 (outrage of modesty), which carries the maximum sentence of only 2 years imprisonment. In contrast, a man who commits exactly the same offence is deemed a case of rape, which carries the maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, a difference of a factor of 10.

Repeal of S509 and enactment of S377BAof the Penal Code

Prior to Jan 2020, males are not protected under the insult of modesty (non-physical sexual harassment) law. In fact, prior to the establishment of Protection from Harassment Act in 2014, there is seemingly no legal recourse for males if they are subjected to non-physical harassment. Currently, women are still more protected than men from modesty related offences.

Laws such as S27(1)(d) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act and S4 of the Defamation Act are gender-specific and only protect women.

S377 of the Penal Code

No provision pertaining to the deviant act of sexual exploitation of a corpse by a woman exist. Under the current legal framework, S377 (sexual penetration of a corpse) applies explicitly for males only. A woman who employs the penis of a deceased man to sexually penetrate herself on her own accord is seemingly not liable for any legal repercussion.

S377A of the Penal Code

Male homosexual acts of any nature (even private acts) are condemnable under the law (outrages of decency) whereas female homosexual acts are not subjected to this abjective limitation.

S366, S372, S373, S373A of the Penal Code, Part XI of the Women's Charter etc

Most laws protecting victims of prostitution are gender-specific and are only accorded to females.

S61 of the Education (Schools) Regulations

With regards to medical examination in school, consent from girls over the age of 10 is mandated under the law if they are to be examined by a male person. Consent from boys over the age of 10 (or of any age for the matter) is not mandated under the law, regardless of circumstances.

S83 of the Criminal Procedure Code

With regards to body searching, a male officer can only conduct searches upon a female person if he has strong reasons to believe that she is a terrorist and that she is about to carry out an act of terrorism. Conversely, no such limitation is imposed upon female officers and they are empowered to conduct searches upon persons of any sex, regardless of circumstances.

S69 of the Women's Charter

A woman is eligible to file for spousal maintenance against her husband regardless of circumstances. However, a man is only eligible to file for spousal maintenance against his wife if he is permanently incapacitated before or during the marriage and by virtue of his incapacity, he is rendered permanently unable to maintain himself. A woman is also eligible for file for nominal maintenance in cases where her earning capacity is similar or higher than her counterpart. A man is not accorded this right.

Gender-specific financial schemes Schemes such as Working Mother's Child Relief, Basic Childcare Subsidy, Foreign Maid Levy Relief and Grandparent Caregiver Relief are only applicable for mothers. Even single fathers are not eligible for any of these perks.

Unequal parental leave

Mothers are entitled to 16 weeks of paid maternal leave whereas fathers are only entitled to 2 weeks of paid paternal leave. It must be said that a recent change in policy has allowed fathers to 'siphon' up to 4 weeks of paid parental leave from their counterparts, subjective to their partners' concurrence. However, only married fathers are entitled to paid paternal leave and shared parental leave. Mothers are entitled to paid maternity leave, regardless of marital status. Moreover, fathers, even single fathers are not entitled to paid adoption leave. An adoptive mother is entitled to 12 weeks of paid adoption leave. A married adoptive father is entitled to 4 weeks of shared parental leave, subjective to his partner's concurrence. A single adoptive father is not eligible for any parental leave aside from paid childcare leave.

S4(3) of the Adoption of Children Act

A single man is not eligible to adopt a female child unless in 'exceptional circumstances'. Conversely, a single woman is free to adopt a child of any sex.

Termination of Pregnancy Act

A father has absolutely zero prenatal parental rights but is subjected to the full spectrum of parental liabilities. A mother can, with her unilateral decision and without the consent or even knowledge of her counterpart, goes for an abortion and deprive her counterpart of his child, regardless of the father’s wishes or means. A mother can also, on her own decision and without the consent or knowledge of her counterpart, delivers a child, in which her counterpart is expected to fulfill his legal and moral obligations to be responsible for the welfare of the child, regardless of the father’s wishes or means. This is true even in cases whereby the child is a product of sexual assault perpetrated by the mother. The fundamental principle here is 'my body my choice'. Principles such as 'our child our choice', 'my money my choice' and 'its life its right to live' are of little significance.

S53(e) of the Penal Code and S325 - S332 of the Criminal Procedure Code; S88 of the Education (Schools) Regulations

Only males are subjected to institutionalised corporal punishment (judicial, military and school caning) in Singapore. Females are not to be caned under any circumstances. The principle of equal liberty and liability is of little significance when it comes to gender.

National Service

Only males are required to serve their mandatory obligation to the state. This is despite the fact that the stature governing the policies of national service (Enlistment Act) is gender-neutral and seemingly applies to all persons, regardless of sex. Persons who completed their mandatory service and persons who are exempted from service are accorded the same statutory rights and privileges.

“Equality”

 Ong Ming Wee, who was acquited of rape.

He was even sentenced as guilty by a feminist judge and had to get the verdict overturned thanks to Subhas.

The woman who made the false rape claim was never revealed and paid no damages to Mr. Ong, who had to suffer damage to his reputation and paid huge legal fees.

Only men and boys are allowed to be caned.

Personal anecdotes from some redditors

When I was in Primary 3, there was an incident where an intense fight broke out between a girl and a boy in my class. The brawl arose as the girl had deliberately taken and damaged the boy’s treasured Pokémon cards. Thankfully, none of them sustained any serious injuries. For punishment, both were made to write lines. However, on top of writing lines, the boy was publicly caned whilst the girl was not subjected to additional repercussion. Just before the caning, the disciplinary master publicly admonished and degraded the boy on stage, chiding him for being a scum for raising his hands upon a girl. No such reciprocal statements were made upon the girl, who was sitting right there in the crowd watching him get caned. After the caning, he was made to vow on stage not to lay his hands on a girl ever again.

The poor boy was only nine then. How does one expect him to have a healthy and balanced view of society, or to believe that as an individual, he is equally precious when he was subjected to such blatantly unfair treatment and disregard solely due to his sex? Unfortunately, after that incident, he developed severe apprehension and a searing hatred for school and authority. This was despite the school management admitting negligence on their part and had profusely apologised to him and his parents. - u/appletree911

This occurred more than two decades ago. Back then public caning was employed extremely liberally, especially for my conservative Chinese school. The blatant display of preferential treatment for girls was also ridiculously evident.

Boys were severely punished for lightly teasing girls but the reverse cannot be further from the truth. In fact, during those days there was a popular ""prank"" where girls will pull down the pants of unsuspecting boys. All this warrants for is a good laugh at the expense of the boys' fluster and humiliation. Can you imagine the armageddon if the reverse was to happen?

I have a mate who had ended his own life at the tender age of 15, with his public caning being probably the last straw. People often just think of the physical aspects of caning without much consideration for the modesty of the subject and the emotional harm that comes along with it, especially for public caning, where one's ""manliness"" is publicly trialed in the presence of his peers. Yelping or displaying any sign of weakness often leads to bullying and belittling.

Moreover, for my school, in cases of class or public caning, girls have the option of retreating from the class/assembly after the announcement of a boy’s offences, if they were uncomfortable with the situation. On the other hand, it was mandatory for boys to sit through the entire process to be ‘educated’, even if they may feel uncomfortable too. I vividly remember an instance of public caning back in primary school where a male pal of the boy being caned broke down and sob inconsolably in tandem to the cries of his friend on stage, both of which garnered jeers from their fellow peers. Only then was he allowed to leave with the escort of his form teacher.

As bewildering as it may sound, a friend who was caned and cried on stage described to me that he hoped he was raped instead. That really took a toll on me. It really caused me to be vehemently against caning. Think about the scene of judicial caning for instance, where the subject is stripped naked, bound to the trestle, being forced to adopt such a degrading posture and lashed like a beast in a room full of strangers, sometimes with persons of the opposite sex. I firmly believe that if you do not punish one with rape, you do not punish one with caning. - u/appletree911

When I was in primary school, my male teacher would hit the hand of any boy that did anything mischievous as a form of punishment with the long classroom ruler. If a female student did something mischievous, the most he would do was scold - u/Thefearlesscow


Do we just accept it and suck it up?

Notable comments by redditors (IMO)
u/BBFA2020
""Honestly I have being lurking forever but NS is always the ugly head that will appear eventually. Why? Singapore's TFR is currently at 0.87 courtesy of CIA (link below). It means we are at a very real threat of having not enough people to perform NS duties in a few decades time.

So the govt will have to seriously consider either fix the problem or ""outsource it"". I mean who likes NS and asking girls to go for mandatory NS is something I wish for no-one. After all I finished mine and I don't want the next generation to suffer.

But until NS is abolished, it will remain a sore point and a potential population issue in the future. And let's not forget that we had several horrific accidents (Aloysius pang anyone) in 2018/2019. So NS isn't exactly a walk in the park either.

I want to say

**Hang in there! You are doing great!**

Many people around you also have their own struggles and failures. I am not saying this to belittle or invalidate your feelings, but I want you to know that you are not alone in this fight. We are all in this together. It is not just the recession that is affecting us, the pandemic has forced us to distance ourselves from each other. And those of us who normally rely on social interaction or even simply companionship, this support has been stripped away. But the very fact that you are reading this, means that you are choosing not to give up. It is the opposite! You are saying, ""I am fighting my hardest, and looking to stay afloat! Give me something to hang on to!"". That is something to be proud of.

**Be kind to yourself.**

Some of us might be wondering if we should quit our jobs if we are under so much stress but hold back because of how bad the market is out there. The truth is, both options are not easy choices, especially for those of you with families to feed or parents to take care of. If you are not feeling motivated for work, see if you can step away for a moment and take some time to yourself. If possible, step out of the house or office and get some fresh air. Don't take this journey as a sprint; it is a marathon and no one is in tip top condition right now.

**Reach out and ask for help.**

If you have friends nearby (or if you trust your colleagues), reach out for a coffee chat and share your struggles. You may be surprised that they have some problems of their own too. Sometimes the act of narrating your story helps you gain perspective, and the being able to speak out aids in recovery. If you are not comfortable talking to your friends or family, I welcome you to share your own story below - we are all in this together!

**Take baby steps**

For most of us, there is unlikely a quick fix that is around the corner. This means we will need to manage our own issues and learn to deal with it. It is daunting to see the mountain of what we are trying to achieve, but no one built Rome in a day. Take each day at a time, and break down each day into manageable chunks. You can focus on work for 1 hour and give yourself a 10 minute break to reward yourself. If you are looking for work, maybe treat yourself to a nice movie after having done 10 applications.

173,singapore,264341,Favorite pastime in Singapore for an international student..,in5jjo,friedchickenshit,1599328301,68,1,"I am an Indonesian international student studying in a university in SG. I am fairly familiar with Singapore, since I've been coming here fairly often when I was little for a family member's cancer treatment. So when it was decided that I was going to uni in SG, I was not surprised. It was close to home, safe, and in some aspects affordable in terms of living costs. My friends studying in the US, UK, or Australia all freak out when I tell them my favorite meal is 3.5 sgd pork rice from just behind my apartment building, when the minimum amount for them to eat out would be around 10-20$. 

I've stayed in SG for about 3.5 years now, and made friends with a lot of locals. They love showing me all the local spots, and I've gotta say, locals my age group LOVE to drink. They fucking love it. I had a good time with all of them, before most of them went off to do NS and I had to make friends with the older guys in class. They are also fun, and they try their best to get me to go to the gym lol.

But both local and international student friends of mine, some not all, tend to have a common complaint. They think Singapore is boring. The buildings all look the same, the food while delicious is the same in most hawker spots, and there's not much here in terms of recreational activities. I don't exactly agree with this, but honestly sometimes I do get bored here. I tried hiking and honing my photography skills here, but that got old fast. But the one thing I never get tired of, is solo taxi rides when I need to go somewhere or just go home. I love striking a conversation with the drivers. Be it young guys in online cabs, or uncles in the trans cabs. They come from all walks of life and all have interesting stories. It's amazing that they are mostly willing to share deep, personal stories about their backgrounds and experiences. I guess they sort of see me as blogging to a reddit throwaway account, where they don't have to worry about their loved ones finding out about all their deepest darkest secrets. 

I could be taking a trip from balestier and the kind driver would tell me stories about how Jalan Dusun was once a movie theater and how he used to go there all the time in his youth. I once had a driver with a large spiderman toy attached to his van explain to me that his son loves spiderman and so he puts the toy there to remind him of his son during work. I hailed a cab in Marina Bay Sands and the uncle explained that I was wasting money playing there and should go to Malaysia if I was really serious about my gambling lol. Then he offered to sell me tickets to a seminar from a guru to boost my gambling fortunes. I booked an online cab from the peace mansion building and the driver actually saved me from a nearby drunk guy trying to fight me because I couldn't speak Chinese. We later laughed about it and he explained to me that he used to be an alcoholic in his youth, until he decided to change one day. He then gave me tips on how to stop drinking and just talked about life. It's like an endless storybook, and the one aspect of my adventure in Singapore that never gets boring; its people.

But now, I can't go back due to the virus and I have to do the last semester of my uni life online. Not the goodbye that I imagined, so its kinda sad. I wrote this because I am feeling nostalgic due to the possibility of not returning to SG for a very long time still. I will miss the bus rides (especially bus 75 driver who hands out lollipops, you da man), the humid, humid walk going between buildings, I miss late night salted egg chicken deliveries and the duck rice in Toa Payoh, and I'm gonna miss the people of Singapore especially.

174,singapore,257258,Singapore Democratic Party detailed its progress in the last four decades,i6jtnh,muscularthor,1596981750,4,1,"𝗦𝗗𝗣 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗲𝘅𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗳𝗼𝗼𝘁𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝘁

As the Singapore Democratic Party turns 40 on 6 August on the back GE2020 and reviews a slew of initiatives to move forward, to stay relevant, the SDP needs to also expand its electoral footprint.
 
Since its founding on 6 August 1980, the SDP has contested in all 10 general elections. Starting with 3 seats in 1980, it fielded 18 seats - the highest number in 1988. Since 1991, it has fielded an average of 10.3 candidates in the last seven general elections.

In the last 10 general elections the SDP has contested in a total of 44 SMCs and 12 GRCs and has fielded a total 97 candidates - 44 candidates in SMCs and 53 candidates in GRCs.

Out of the 44 SMCs, the SDP has scored above 40 percent in 21 SMCs and had won 5 SMCs - 3 times in Potong Pasir (1984, 1988 and 1991) and once in Nee Soon South and Bukit Gombak (1991).

The SDP has also contested in 2 by-elections. The first in 1992 in the 4-member Marine Parade GRC and the second in 2016 in the Bukit Batok SMC.

There are 7 occasions when the SDP has been in 3 or multi-corner electoral contests. 6 times in SMCs during general elections and 1 time in a 4-member GRC during the 1992 by-election. In all occasions SDP was in second place.

Here is an interesting point, should the SDP choose to expand and inevitably ends up in a three or multi-corner fight, it remains a strong contender. SDP’s secured its largest count of 158, 341 votes or a popular vote of 39.4 percent when it fielded 18 candidates in 1991.

The SDP has been through 40 eventful years. In 10 years, on 6 August 2030, the SDP will turn 50.

To stay relevant and shape Singapore’s democratic history, the SDP needs to expand its electoral footprint.

This is a question a lot of my friends almost ask me, ""Will you fight or run if SG goes to war?"". I don't know is my answer absurd and ridiculous, so I want to find out from my fellow Singaporeans if anyone will do the same as me.

Assuming I'm in physically in SG at that point of time, my choice will definitely be to fight till the very end. No doubt I am scared if that really happens, but would running be possible? If there's a war, wouldn't airports close? Assuming you are thinking of illegally leaving SG, can you guarantee you won't get caught by either our SPF coast guard, Navy, or even the enemy?

We are so small, where can we hide? If they attack, wouldn't it be better to be a soldier with a gun than an ordinary citizen hiding at home? We all know what could happen to a country's citizens if the country is captured. Anyone remembers the Japanese Occupation?

Won't people be scared of being labelled a traitor? If we are going to die both ways, I rather go down in honour than to be executed or have to work as slaves till I overwork and die.

Lastly, my family members are here. I would die knowing my family is safe than the suffer together, having to starve and live everyday eating potatoes and whatever rations the occupying army is given.

I'm definitely not the most patriotic guy in town but like if either way is death or endless suffering, might as well I go down for a cause? Plus thats the only practical thing to do because running won't be an option. Am I alone?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/i6ivou/will_you_fight_for_sg_should_a_war_arise/,1.0,['no']

 Let me speak about them through this analogy:  
In Formula One, when a driver/team wins the Championship, everyone heaps praise on the driver, team management and the designers.   
Nobody seems to remember the mechanics who work tirelessly in the background to get everything fixed up. But without the mechanics, there'll be no car for the driver to win on Sunday.

The same thing applies in the hospital. Pre-COVID, nurses weren't always celebrated, or receiving the same amount of recognition in the public. Without the nurses taking care of the patients 24/7, nobody will be recovering. No medical marvels can occur.

Today, our nurses are rightfully celebrated and have finally received the recognition they should have received long ago, long before the fight against COVID-19 began.

Regretfully, other groups have fallen into the same zone, which was once occupied by nurses. Take our delivery riders, and deliverymen. These brave men/women work tirelessly, rain or shine, on bicycles, scooters and Motorbikes, unprotected from the elements, while taking the risk of contracting COVID-19 everyday. Without them, everyone will need to go out to purchase their meals even when they are busy, and head to shops just to pick up their own items, resulting in large crowds everywhere.

Lastly, and certainly not least, I should also mention the Civil Service. One such group falling under this banner are the teachers. Teachers who took extra care and time to do recorded/live lessons during the Circuit Breaker period, alongside extra coaching for students on weekends through online platforms. All this took extra time, extra effort.

Everyone already argues about it, so I won't add on to it here. I am not blaming women for this, the things I'm blaming near the bottom of my post. And, I think that inequality for one group, is inequality for all, so again, not blaming women.

**Lets start with the law. I Am Not A Lawyer.**

[S375, Singapore penal code](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871#pr375-)

According to this, only men are capable of rape. Or more correctly, one must be in possession of a dick in order to commit rape (not sure about the situation with FtM trans). Therefore, a woman cannot be charged with it. The law is gender specific.

[S377, Singapore penal code](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871#pr377-)

Women cannot be found guilty of using a, oh god, corpse's dick. However, if some sick man decides to stick it in, he's gonna go to jail.

[S377A, Singapore penal code](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871#pr377A-)

Again, male homosexuality is punishable under the law, while female homosexuality isn't.

[S4(3), Adoption of Children act](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/ACA1939#pr4-)

If a guy is single, he may not adopt a female child, unless there are 'special circumstances', whatever the hell those are.

A female cannot be caned, and there are many more. I'm sure you can think of some. All gender specific terms, unless its biological (possession of a dick, for instance) should be removed.

So, why?

**Again, I Am Not A Lawyer. This is all just my personal opinion.**

- Society

Insert we live in a society joke here. Just take a look at Singapore's demographics. A lot of old people, right? There is a mindset of 'so that we don't offend the aunties' used to justify the laws. Just take a look at when Watain was banned from playing just hours before the scheduled show. Why? Christians (aunties, probably). Relevant point later. Society expects men to be the sole breadwinner, and society also thinks that men are predators and therefore the dangerous one. Often times, women are thought of as weaker, and let me just say, I have met a lot of men who were much weaker than me.

I'm sure you've heard of ""Eh if you see a uncle at playground you better call police ah!"" and, ""Wah see? Confirm this uncle want XMM""

- History

Women, throughout history, have been oppressed. That's based in facts. I don't think people will argue about that, when women had to fight for the rights to vote.

- Singapore's (or government's) unwillingness to change

Lets be honest. The government is pretty much made out of boomers. And they're the type who will say 'man up, stop whining!' Take a look at the pledge, for example.

""...regardless of race, language or religion...based on justice and equality...""

Spot something? Nowhere is gender or sexuality stated. Singapore wants to pride itself as a multicultural society, and as a progressive country. Laws take so long to be passed, and even then, it has to appeal to the old boomers.

- Who am I blaming?

The old people, boomers.

Also, tangentially related question, how does one become a politician? So that those people who say, 'Be the change you want to see' or 'You talk only, got do meh?' won't be able to attack me.

182,singapore,270406,What Singapore can learn from the US presidential debate,j2ifsi,OldProtectionism,1601455204,269,1,"With the first presidential debate between Democrat candidate Joe Biden and Republican incumbent Donald Trump recently over, a sh\*tstorm has emerged on social media. The technologically savvy are flooding pages with their memes, and news outlets are rushing out their articles.

And after watching just five minutes of the debate (coupled with skimming through some articles and memes), I think there's a lot we as Singaporeans can take away from all this, even if we are thousands of kilometres away from them.

**1) The divisiveness of partisan politics**

First thing that came to mind was the hyper-partisanry that exists in US politics. It's alarming and almost crazy, but even though some of us may think such a thing would never happen in Singapore, I'd believe that there is growing potential for partisanry here.

You already start to see divisions forming, based on those who follow MSM devoutly (Straits Times, Today, CNA, etc) and those who uphold alternative news media outlets like TOC and WakeUpSG as the bringers of absolute truth. Not yet very visible, but definitely growing.

To quote PM Lee on describing partisan politics:

&gt;This is my side, and that is yours. There is no middle ground, only sides to take. There are no truths or facts, only different versions of reality - facts and, of equal standing, 'alternative facts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Politics becomes toxic and bitter. The country is divided, and goes into a downward spiral.   
&gt;  
&gt; If this happens to Singapore, we will not just cease being an exceptional nation. It will be the end of us. We must not go down this path.

The reality is that it is true. If the US can become so divisive, why can't it happen to us? Maybe not next year, or the following year, but perhaps in a decade or two, it very well may become the reality.

We need to keep in mind that regardless of our political views (pro-PAP, pro-opposition, or even neutral), we are Singaporeans and want the best for our country. Remembering this will help to manage the proliferation of partisanry here, and hopefully prevent us from going down a slippery slope.

**(This is not sponsored by National Education or whatever, just to say.)**

**2) Accountability** 

While I do agree with the sentiments held by some Singaporeans that the ruling PAP needs to be held more accountable for its actions, it is worth to note and appreciate the level of accountability we already have.

For all the sh\*t we give Jo Teo and her compatriots, at the very least they usually don't spew falsehoods and provocative statements on the level Donald Trump and his posse do in the US. Tables will definitely flip if they do such a thing, especially in this day and age post-LKY.

And what some people in the US are demanding for better accountability in the White House, can be taken into serious consideration for adoption here in Singapore, so as to improve accountability and transparency of our own government.

**3) Despite our differences, nation comes first**

Already mentioned this indirectly or in passing in the first point, but I cannot stress this enough. We see the selfie PM Lee took with Pritam Singh, and think its a normal occurrence. Some may also think that its a tokenistic action taken by LHL or whatnot.

But in all honesty do you think such a thing would happen in today's American society? Do you really think Trump and Biden would take any picture together, without the burning desire to insult each other? I mean sure, you could argue that this is an anomaly, given how Obama and his McCain in 2008 were actually seemed to be on quite decent terms, despite rivalry and all. And actually despite how bitter Obama and Mitt Romney seemed to be in 2012, they have actually defended each other on more than one occasion.

And I do think that most opposition politicians want the best for Singapore, and that they aren't in the arena because of some personal agenda or whatnot. The only exception that comes to mind off-hand is of course Lim Tean, but that's a story for another time.

So, if the politicians are able to put Singapore before their political differences when needed, I think we should too. Fight all you want on political matters, but beyond that arena we are all Singaporeans, regardless of race, language, and religion.

**4) How debates should not be like**

The debate between Trump and Biden were full of low-blows, character assassinations - in general things most debaters would frown upon. Honestly, even Biden was not exempt from resorting to such tactics during the debate.

Thankfully we don't see much of this during political debates here in Singapore. **And it needs to stay that way.** Debates are meant to be meaningful intellectual discussions on perspectives, problems, and policies, not to insult each other to kingdom come just to pander to your own base. 

As much as some of us may wish to see LO Singh or Jamus Lim to beat LHL down in parliament, or for Tharman to crush one of the opposition MPs, debates and discourse need to be kept civil and fruitful. If not honestly, what's the point? We'll only get short term satisfaction of seeing people we don't like get destroyed on the screen, and few meaningful decisions reached on improving the country going forward.

When I first try bak kut teh, it was white and very different, you know? because it was soup with peppers. Thought maybe I was at a wrong touristy place. When I made friends with a few local Redditors, I was dying to ask them the question, ""what would be the food to convince me?""

They took a while to brainstorm among themselves to impress me with local food. One of them caught inspiration and burst out, ""KE KOU MIAN!"" then another was like ""oh- oh- BAK CHOR MEE! We can have a noods day!"" Everyone was agreeing then started sharing their best memories with the food. Like how everyone would go all the way to eat KKM after drinking. 

One thing after another, everyone was chanting ""KKM! BCM! WEST SIDE BEST SIDE!"" I am impressed by their intense enthusiasm. I was looking forward and crossing off my calendar every day. 

Noods day came, it was an hour transit to bukit panjang but it got to be worth it. I was late and worried to miss out on the good food because of the long queue. We sat down and got drinks, everyone was still talking about how good the food is. It was a 20-minute wait or so, the aunty finally called out to our table telling us the food is ready! 

My friend got up to get the food, we were clapping and celebrating the food's arrival! It wasn't awkward at all while the other table is staring at us for being so loud. The moment the bowls of noodles land on the table, I was speechless while my friends were roaring in excitement. I stare at my bowl of noodles for a second. All I see is maggie mee in freaking ban mian soup.

I was disappointed.

Of course, I try not to show it in front of my friends. It makes me miss the food at home so much more. On the first spoonful, I realize that there is nothing special about it, even the mee was undercook compare to the ones I cook at home. 

Maybe I ate it too fast without tasting it properly. On the second taste, I let it rest in my mouth for a while trying to grasp for some excitement out of it. 

Nothing. 

My friend already finishes the bowl by the time I took my third spoonful. I ate a few more spoons and my appetite is gone, the food is tasteless. Everything felt off. I was quiet for the rest of the day.

As we hung out and chill for the rest of the day, well it is noods day. They brought me to this kopitiam for Bak Chor Mee at CCK since it is closer to his place. The queue is long and the place is crowded. I do not trust long queues anymore, everyone is queuing for whatever everyone else is queuing.

I have trust issues. Will you stand at the side waiting 10 minutes or so for a table for this hyped-up food? I am in such a terrible mood but I guess we got to eat anyways.

When the food arrived, it looks exactly like wantan mee at some point except this with each noodle is covering with a very thin layer of vinegar and a teaspoon of chili at the side and minced meat all over. I guess after all the waiting and standing, looking at this makes my mouth watering. I was nervous. My hyped for noods came back. My friends were staring at me hoping I would make my first bite.

As I got it prepped with my spoon, the sensation smell of vinegar on noodles was wonderful. I have never had such a thing before. I put a few minced meats to make the perfect first mouthful of bak chor mee. Right before I eat, I got my eyes closed ready to consume something so delectable. It was such a pleasant and enjoyable feeling in my mouth that I chew very slowly, finally swallowed, and opening my eyes again. I see my friends starring at me.

[https://www.starhub.com/personal/bundles/homehub-plus/1gbps.html](https://www.starhub.com/personal/bundles/homehub-plus/1gbps.html)

I know some, if not many new young tech savvy folks no longer watch cable TV but hear me out... as my TV package is for my elderly to watch. Getting them to learn how to use the laggy Fibre TV set top box to change channel and access VOD is already a miracle (for the elderly I have to bear with). Getting them to master an android TV usage via a remote control (no touch screen argh) is... they can't even use the smartphone properly, much less WhatsApp. But that's not the only headache...

# NO MORE FREE TO AIR LIVE TV (ok, not really but really)

With this new Android Starhub TV+ box,  if uncle, auntie, Ah Ma, Ah Gong wants to watch channel 8. They can't. No more channel 102, or channel U for Kdrama. Ah but wait, Starhub has a genius fix. You need to sign up for smart wifi to access the channels. They give you ONE (not two? its meant to be a mesh setup pls) Nokia Beacon and their android TV box HAS to connect to this Nokia Beacon and only this Nokia Beacon (no other 3rd party router) can access the FREE TO AIR TV channels. Really, Starhub? 

Now I have to power an extra router which I won't even use its wireless feature (cause this silly Beacon only has 1 wired LAN port) for my house network, in order to have FREE TO AIR TV? Ok Ok, nvm, that's not the least of my problem. Forget about turning on the TV and being able to watch it right away by changing channels, let us do menu menu menu apps apps menu menu apps ahhh finally, Channel 8. Ah Gong, remember to turn on this extra Nokia round round thing when you wanna watch TV ok? What is this round thing for? So you get WiFi you don't use but pay more electricity, just so you can watch TV, ok Ah Gong? Very simple, make sure TV, Android Box, Nokia all 3 turned on. If still no TV? Not sure how to help you, Ah Gong

# Then the COST, HELLO NEW TV PASS

Ok, since the old cable days there has always been this basic tier package where you get to pick any 3 channels categories for about $30+ a month. So you can mix English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil, etc channels and everyone in the family can enjoy something. Especially since we're a bilingual generation. But now, ITS GONE and the price is hmmm... racist? The English &amp; Asian pass cost $30 a month EACH and other languages at $15 each. So if I want Chinese &amp; English for my family (cause one watch AXN, and the other watch K &amp; Cdrama) I have to pay $60 a month just for that. Why do I have to pay more for something that I already have? That said, I am aware that the new pass have more channels within them but still... I feel like I'm forced to when I don't need but could use the extra channels. Or I could tell one family member that sry, no more AXN, cause the contract only give 1 free TV Pass, so either AXN or no Kdrama. Just watch what the other person is watching and be happy ok? Ah boi no money to pay for your TV

# My thoughts, Right Now

Why? Why you doing this Starhub? Why are you alienating your own customers and forcing them to pay more/use more? I just want the elderly to be happy that at the end of then day, in the midst of this tech decade, they can at least sit down and watch television in peace. BUT NO, ITS ALL RUIN NOW\~!! AND No, I'm not going to be there 24/7 to help them change channel or turn on the TV when they wanna watch TV. I think, I am going to just get a Digital TV Tuner (Which has its own share of signal issue, have to put it near window) to get the Free to Air TV channels, then tell them... sry, no more Starhub TV. Only Mediacorp TV, why? Cause I can't pull up with this shit show from Starhub. I'm trying to really make everyone happy, but I don't think we're going forward. Singtel well... kinda have the same option as what Starhub is introducing/replacing, which I don't want. 

Oh, I forgot to mention this. They have another 2Gbps fibre plan, don't you love faster internet speed? But no, what it does is, it allows you to have 2 x 1Gbps points for connection to two separate routers/equipment. I'm not sure who this is truly for, I dunno... I'm guessing so the husband and wife don't fight cause one is streaming and the other is gaming (lagging to death). But honestly a decent router with smart/manual QOS can handle that... I really think Starhub has totally lost their direction. The only thing I ever love about them is that when they have a new plan, they force everyone to get onto the new plan which tends to offer MORE. Unlike Singtel who doesn't inform you and continues to bill you on the old plan where you pay more for less. But this is starting to come back and bite me.

Comments on that post are locked and I think it quite likely that this post will be removed by the mods, but I choose to write it anyways.

They wrote the following (amongst other things):

&gt; When I was in Primary 3, there was an incident where an intense fight broke out between a girl and a boy in my class. The brawl arose as the girl had deliberately taken and damaged the boy’s treasured Pokémon cards. Thankfully, none of them sustained any serious injuries. For punishment, both were made to write lines. However, on top of writing lines, the boy was publicly caned whilst the girl was not subjected to additional repercussion. Just before the caning, the disciplinary master publicly admonished and degraded the boy on stage, chiding him for being a scum for raising his hands upon a girl. No such reciprocal statements were made upon the girl, who was sitting right there in the crowd watching him get caned. After the caning, he was made to vow on stage not to lay his hands on a girl ever again.

&gt; The poor boy was only nine then. How does one expect him to have a healthy and balanced view of society, or to believe that as an individual, he is equally precious when he was subjected to such blatantly unfair treatment and disregard solely due to his sex? Unfortunately, after that incident, he developed severe apprehension and a searing hatred for school and authority. This was despite the school management admitting negligence on their part and had profusely apologised to him and his parents. - u/appletree911

I really don't want to be rude here.  I know that it's considered extremely rude to come into someone else's space and criticize how things are done in someone else's country.  As an American, I certainly know how I feel when western Europeans and Canadians tell me about how much my country sucks. (Actually, my country has shameful problems with mass incarceration, racism, police brutality, and poverty, just to name a few)

However, I just wanted to say that it absolutely breaks my heart in the most painful way to imagine the above happening to a nine year old boy.

The way the story was narrated above, I have a hard time imagining that any child could have such an experience and not feel extremely messed up as a result.  To me, this rises nearly to the level of a crime against humanity: to take a precious little child and impose such a brutal punishment, and then to furthermore attach it to her sex, which is an accident of his birth.  How can a child like this enjoy good mental health?

I would guess that I am probably speaking to an audience that predominantly approves of corporal punishment, just as my American counterparts generally approve of corporal punishment.  I think that the main difference between corporal punishment of children in the US versus Singapore is that in the US, corporal punishment is usually done with a paddle or an open hand instead of a cane.  In most US jurisdictions, corporal punishment is permitted at home, but not at school.  There are some jurisdictions where it is still practiced in public schools.

I have a little child of my own who is not quite nine years old.  She is a girl, but I can't imagine that I would feel any different about this or love her any more or less if she were a boy, but we, as her parents, made a decision before she was born that corporal punishment would not be part of her upbringing, and we never never once, not a single time, deviated from that decision or even seriously reconsidered it.  I can think of many circumstances in the life of my child where if I had done the same thing, I might have been hit or harshly reprimanded, but looking back, I cannot think of *any circumstance* in which I think things would have been better if I had spanked her or threatened to spank her.

However, as other commenters pointed out, freezing in the moment is [a very common response](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kzjk8n/sexual-assault-fight-flight-freeze) to sexual assault or unwanted contact. If anything, it makes those accounts more credible because it's not how most people expect a victim to respond. Similarly, it's common for victims to then try and play down the assault as a way to convince themselves everything was ok and thus fend off trauma.

Unfortunately, that also means there may be no clear signal that the contact is unwanted or even causing her extreme distress. And that means that the guy on the other end may have no clue that his actions caused harm, and may think that everything is fine between them, and thus get shocked and angry if she eventually claims to have been assaulted by him. From his point of view, she didn't openly reject his moves and he therefore assumed it was ok to go further, while from her point of view, she was too terrified to react or speak.

So - what would you consider a good way for a girl to make it clear that she is not comfortable with a sexual advance, *without* putting her safety at risk? While you may personally be a decent person who can take a no, some guys get very angry and turn violent when rejected outright, or find other ways to hurt her or ruin the girl's life as revenge for turning him down. There are lots of such stories out there. It's a big reason many don't dare to openly reject a guy and just hope he'll get the hint if she doesn't return his advances.

Skip zoo visits for now, at least till they are more prepared.

Just went last weekend, the shows now require 1-1.5hr early queuing to get entry ticket due to limited capacity (the one I went was 100, the animal fight back one) i.e. You are queuing up inside the zoo and wasting time which could be spent roaming other areas. If you are number 101, then sorry no luck, and you don't know if you are the unlucky one until they start giving out the numbers half an hour before the show starts. The elephant show is also suspended till further notice. 

Not only that, the show feels like a rehearsal session - short, unprepared, cockups. Even the host prefaced the show by saying its a ""practice for new friends"" or something along that line. My daughter had been very excited to go zoo and we queued for a show only because she wanted to see one. Throughout she was unimpressed and after it ended, she was still asking when is the show starting? And frankly, the animals look tired and the same all these years since my school days, like the white tiger attraction, elephants that look so weary... 

Hey zoo mgmt, I'm fine if the animals have been out of contact with audience and needs some getting used to crowds again, but at least let the people inside know they are queuing up for such quality so they can decide if it's worth their time? In fact, let people know about the current show situation (aka ""practice sessions"")  so they can factor this in and decide if this part of the zoo visit is important for them viz a viz the price?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/itpeio/zoo_visit_heads_up_if_you_are_thinking_to_go/,1.0,"[""Maybe they should allow online bookings instead.

192,singapore,285320,Feeling guilty as a bystander to workplace bullying,jvvizd,Inevitable_Homework,1605628917,55,22,"So, uh, I’m choosing to post this here as I feel that having people familiar with our culture/behaviour will understand more about where I’m coming from

I work in a HR office at a huge company as a temp. Due to covid, the office of 20 is split into two teams, A and B, with each team coming to the office for two days (Mon, Tues and Thurs, Fri.) Wednesdays are WFH. I’m the sole exception and come in every day for misc duties like filing and stuff. 

Team A is chill. Made up of older women and a few early twenties adults. I enjoy working with them a lot.

Team B is made up of middle aged (think 30s) people, and also a few young adults. And team B ‘bullies’ one of the ladies on a daily basis

In B, there’s a clique made up of the middle aged ladies. They’re good at their jobs, and are nice to me. I personally have no grudge towards them and find them funny as well. But I see them verbally abuse one of the ladies, P - scolding her for not doing her job, not to beat around the bush, speak faster, why is she asking stupid questions, etc etc. It’s obviously clear that they’re targeting her alone, and I’m feeling a bit of frustration at myself regarding this

The thing is, P is nice. Sweet in a way, but I will admit that she is air-headed and often talks around the bush in a way that may be irritating to people rushing for time (and in HR they’re pretty much rushing all the time). She’s the richest in the office as well, and likes to share with me about her vacations and ‘rich people activities’. I don’t like to assume that she’s ‘showing off’, so I just go along with it and be friendly to her. Besides, it’s not everyday I get to see what exactly is inside a 5-star hotel in Greece and the size of lobster they serve. Her experience is interesting to me.

According to Team B, they’re irritated at P as she is unable to keep up with the workload and tends to forget whatever she’s learnt, therefore she wasting the team’s valuable time when they barely have it. I personally have not witnessed that, so I just took it with a grain of salt.

The point is, due to past experiences I have learnt a lesson in not being a sheep and believe anything anyone says until I’ve seen it with my own two eyes. So I do not join in with the ‘bullying’, but I keep to myself when it happens. And thinking about it today is making me feel disgusted and frustrated at myself for what I’m doing. On one hand, I don’t want to be a bystander to bullying. On the other, I firmly believe in minding my own business when I don’t have full facts to both side of the story. I don’t really want to start a fight with anyone either by meddling in. 

I’m not sure if this is right. What do y’all think? Did you experienced workplace bullying or witnessed it?

While I do commend the Government for its implementation of SafeEntry (registering yourself when entering public venues and all) throughout Singapore, I cannot help but feel unjust – knowing that the Government has warranted a radical measure even after consideration with the low number of community and local COVID cases within Singapore.

**1. TraceTogether, and what does it collect?**

&gt;*""Contact-tracing device will not track location; people can use TraceTogether if they prefer.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan, written by Straits Times

On 20th October 2020, Singapore has announced that starting from December onwards, [TraceTogether shall be made compulsory](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/compulsory-use-tracetogether-check-venues-such-malls-schools-workplaces-december-govt) when accessing public venues in a bid to further reopen the economy to ensure proper facilitation of contact tracing – either by app or token. The objectives of TraceTogether has been made clear by [Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan back during the Supplementary Budget 2020 Parliamentary Inquiry on TraceTogether](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGvUexD1Udk&amp;t=80s), where he states:

&gt;*""Allow me to recap for members what the TraceTogether app does ... a contact tracing app which uses the phone Bluetooth function to detect other phones' nearby ... (to keep) a record of other TraceTogether users whom you happen to be in* ***close contact*** *... (and that) in the unlikely event you turn out to be positive or diagnosed with COVID-19 ... The contact tracing teams in MOH uses this to quickly identify, isolate patients, quarantine people who may be at risk...""*

Wherein during the Parliamentary Inquiry, Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan has explained the rationale of making TraceTogether voluntary:

&gt;*""Today, TraceTogether has been downloaded on a voluntary basis by 1.5M users ... (and that it) is encouraging. Unfortunately, (TraceTogether) does not appear to work as well on iOS or Apple devices. as the iOS operating system actually suspends Bluetooth scanning when the app is running in the background ... (and that) because* ***TraceTogether does not work equally across all smartphones, we have decided therefore at this point in time, not to mandate the compulsory use of TraceTogether.****""*

[Dr Vivian Balakrishnan during the Parliamentary Inquiry](https://preview.redd.it/ns2da0fyivu51.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=971f608816516c725ce559e32846a93ecf382daa)

In support of Dr. Balakrishnan statements, [an independent redditor has went about extracting the TraceTogether information from his phone, and showed us the full catalog of what TraceTogether is effectively collecting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ftpc3r/oc_i_extracted_my_own_tracetogether_data_from_my/) As promised, it does not encompass anything sophisticated like GPS other than the time, contact session and other small variable factors (signal strength, phone models).

Moving on to the present day, the drastic – but unsurprising – shift towards a mandated use of TraceTogether has been presented with the necessity to maintain the standards of contact tracing in the recovery stages of our economy. The rationale of such a change, initially being that **TraceTogether does not work on all mobile platforms**, has been transformed to that of the necessity of increasing adoption, by using its data to classify close contacts in a quick and appropriate response; in which I must point that from then on, both of these rationales are not synonymous to one another.

**2. Implications and shortcomings towards TraceTogether**

Given that now we have known what was the purpose of making TraceTogether voluntary, the drastic action from one of opt-in to compulsory, and that what TraceTogether effectively collects, I can finally share my thoughts on what this whole grandeur scheme is trying to present itself as.

First of all, the efficacy on the principle of TraceTogether. No doubt, TraceTogether is a noble and just cause to ensure that contact tracing remains prevalent as the economy reopens – with more individuals interacting with one another in a recovering economy, there lies the need to improve how we contact trace altogether, alongside with SafeEntry. However, [CDC has repeatedly stated that any interactions with a case such as walking by the person or briefly being in the same room does not put you at a high risk of COVID-19](http://www.bccdc.ca/resource-gallery/Documents/Guidelines%20and%20Forms/Guidelines%20and%20Manuals/Epid/CD%20Manual/Chapter%201%20-%20CDC/2019-nCoV-Interim_Guidelines.pdf) (which by the way, [Singapore has also expressed similar statements as well](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/risk-of-being-infected-with-covid-19-while-exercising-outdoors-12649902)). This is also not to mention that [COVID-19 may also spread by indirect contact transmission (aka surface/fomite contamination)](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions), which may make contact tracing even harder without the point of origin, although there are present measures to counter this (disinfectants). Given that TraceTogether is an ""extension"" of SafeEntry in that any nearby passerby can be easily identified and so, therein lies the question on **what exactly TraceTogether is trying to achieve in its rationale and objective in terms of its efficacy?** 

Getting faster adoption? SafeEntry already does that with a universal mobile webpage or even better, the pink NRIC.

Improve contact tracing? Sure, but how feasible is it given the studies presented tonight, along with its efficacy?

Faster response? Sure, seems rational, but with SafeEntry being appropriate for the job and the element of human behaviour (and its ability of inertia), how certain are we to say that TraceTogether will be efficient in delivering its efficacy? Why make a voluntary choice mandatory if faster response is what you want?

[An independent redditor has showed what TraceTogether has been collecting](https://preview.redd.it/l43vk8c0jvu51.png?width=1373&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5330d034021b497b3ac66aa3938c3d0d9062065)

Secondly, data collection. I'm not going to bore you with the details of privacy invasion (which has been overstated here), but I would like to raise a new question on this particular topic – [most notably by the same independent redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ftpc3r/oc_i_extracted_my_own_tracetogether_data_from_my/). Recall again that TraceTogether also collects other small variable factors such as phone models and signal strength. **Is there any exact rationale towards collecting such irrelevant information such as the phone models of what your ""pings"" are using – and why is this in conflict with the former rationale: that it is supposed to collect a record of other TraceTogether users whom you happen to be in close contact?** Furthermore, the retrieval of a more concerning variable, *the signal strength*, may point to a **more critical fundamental flaw towards the entire TraceTogether app**. Say that TraceTogether is meant to isolate ""close contacts"" of the infected as stipulated previously, then how is TraceTogether supposed to classify what constitutes a ""close contact""? Does prolonged time but weak signal strength bring enough justification of a close contact, or how about an extremely strong signal strength in a relatively short amount of time? How about friends visiting, relatives, and whatsoever that may accidentally be include into this list of ""fake close contacts""?

The point I'm trying to bring here is that if these Bluetooth devices (phone and token alike) give varying signal strength to one another, **then there is no certainty that definitively proves one is a close contact or not; making such data not only unnecessary** (phone models) **but also dangerously unreliable.** The idea that you might be considered a ""close contact"" or not, simply due to the fact that your token / phone is able to pick up the signal or not, might be the start to a prelude of ""possible incidents"" to come – and nobody will even question it under the guise of being a ""safety measure"". Also, for your information, I have not even brought up the possibility of ""hijacking the token"", as [history serves us to remember](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/personal-info-of-15m-singhealth-patients-including-pm-lee-stolen-in-singapores-most), so I will leave it up to your own imagination to think what will exactly happen if ""that"" happens.

&gt;*""If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Andrew Lewis

Lastly, the cost of maintenance of these tokens itself. These tokens are not meant to stand the test of time; and [another independent redditor has given up the numbers](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jfrqne/tracetogether_hardware_is_a_failure/) to showcase the expenditure of this entire project: S$60M++ semiannually. Now, I am sure all of us here are [all too keenly aware on how sturdy these little ""AirPods"" are](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/j5iqny/my_tracetogether_token_had_split_open_when_it_hit/), but as I will mention it again: is the efficacy of such a measure justified given that they are breakable + not waterproof and that people may accidentally (or intentionally) forget these tokens, or is this as they claim it to be: a creative way to hype up the numbers to prove ownership of such tokens among Singaporeans?

**3. SGSecure: its inspirations and comparison with TraceTogether**

I think discussing TraceTogether may have reminded me on another policy that the Government has done so previously: SGSecure. Back in 2016, [SGSecure has been implemented by the Government to utilize the high penetration of mobile phones here to combat terrorism activities through their policy: Run, Hide, Tell](https://www.sgsecure.gov.sg/) – which honestly speaking, I feel that it bears too much resemblance to the [US Active Shooter Policy when you see a school shooter: Run, Hide, Fight](https://www.ready.gov/active-shooter) (and therein lies the question why SG doesn't want us to defend ourselves, but rather to spam their hotlines...). Now, it is a given that both policies (US Active Shooter Policy, SGSecure) were taken to combat domestic and foreign terrorist attacks, but **are the circumstances presented in the US applicable to us Singaporeans?** I raise this question to you all: in the event of a catastrophic incident within Singapore where help requires time to arrive, would it be considered sound policy to ""tell"" and spam our national hotlines to overwhelm the capacity of our own frontline officers, even when alternatives are readily available to do the same capacity as that of SGSecure? (calling 999, 995)

[A noteworthy SGSecure review](https://preview.redd.it/44pfm03wivu51.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4093575a90c0b86a8196436b45221afe4219362)

While I do acknowledge the differences between TraceTogether and SGSecure, and that yes – I should not be making **that** comparison when both of them serves different purposes, I want to raise the similarities between them: and that is what TraceTogether and SGSecure have in common is that it **requires high user participation in the program, utilizing Singapore's high penetration on smartphones to ensure a fast and steady response by our Home Team.** However, despite the noble intentions by the Government on the initiation of these programs, many Singaporeans remain uncertain on participating on such a program, [so much so that even the SGSecure App comes pre-installed into your Samsung smartphone if you have ordered it from Singapore back then](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-mobile-app-serve-eyes-and-ears-during-emergencies). Now then, is this simply just a lack of trust on our own Government, or is this something larger than ourselves as a society?

**4. Efficacy of policies, and a possible start to a ""dangerous"" precedent?**

&gt;*""They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Benjamin Franklin

Now, I am not going to end this on a high note that ""privacy is the most important to us all"" (look at the US for the consequences), but rather that we can conclude that **our policies have started to shift fundamentally from its main objectives**, and that there is the really true possibility that for once: there is a presence of **a misallocation of resource by the Government in dealing with national crisis** (terrorism, pandemic). While this trend is hard to say and that that time can only tell, it is still a fundamental principle to have a well-informed and cynical civilian populace in our address against this crisis. Moreover, should our apathetic approach continue to dominate the rest of the country, it may be taken as approval of its policies, and may be the start of a prelude on something more sinister.

TLDR; TraceTogether is not the foolproof measure, possible leaks and limitations exposed, and that its efficacy may be something of a serious matter despite it being another tool in effectively dealing with COVID. [If you want some inspiration, look at this too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iphgde/discussion_the_rollout_trials_of_the/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jgqtyt/tracetogether_like_sgsecure_will_be_a_failure_in/,1.0,"['&gt; I cannot help but feel unjust – knowing that the Government has warranted a radical measure even after consideration with the low number of community and local COVID cases within Singapore.\n\nTT exists so that sg can open up the floodgates to foreigners again.

199,singapore,301822,A Car Rental Rant,knfplg,justanotherKC,1609377873,45,1,"Before the year ends, just want to let this out.

Be prepared for a long story ahead.

In the middle of this year (2020), I used a car rental service called T****C** (“T”) to rent a car to run some errands. It wasn’t my first time using this service. Unfortunately, while using the rental car, my mom accidentally bumped into another car. It was a very light bump, with a small scratch on the other car and an almost invisible scratch on the rented car. No one was injured. I took photos of both cars and other necessary information.

The third party whose car my mom accidentally scratched contacted me and said he might not want to pursue this further as it is just a small scratch. Nevertheless, as a rule-abiding hirer, I reported this incident to T and subsequently understand that the car that my mom was using was under a car rental company called S*XT. I understood it as T being a platform (not owning any cars) who engaged car rental companies (e.g. S*XT) to use their fleet of cars, correct me if I am wrong. Someone from S*XT contacted me (hereafter called “R”) to guide me through the details for this accident process.

Anyway, T told me to rent the same car for the next few days to bring to an inspection centre to assess the damage, this sounds reasonable, I am paying for the loss of income of the car (other people might have rented the car to use). On the day of bringing the car to the inspection centre, T provided me two wrong addresses and made me drive around looking for the correct workshop and wasting my time. At the inspection, the person basically took a few photos and had a call with T and said I could go back.

And I thought it was all over. Until R contacts me a few days later and asked me to pay the insurance excess of $2,000 (such a nice rounded number which isn’t listed on T’s website or anywhere at all). He starts telling me a lot of jargon and stuff that a layman wouldn’t understand. Thanks to this incident, I also understood more about the word ‘excess’. Initially, I feel very angry that he suddenly throw me this $2,000 amount ($2,140 including GST) and ask me to pay up. And after reading up and asking my friend, I found out this is an amount that I needed to pay IF insurance is activated. He told me that scratches on the other vehicle will be claimed against us (aka me). When I probed further for photos, repair costs, receipts of repairs for the other vehicle, he said he will revert back to me with full details once he has all the necessary costs. Hello?! You don’t have the details you want to ask me to pay $2,000?

Eventually, the amount they finally quoted me is ~$700. Breakdown of $X for the third party vehicle (this is a reasonable amount), $Y for the rented vehicle and $Z for loss of income for the rented vehicle for the days that it is being repaired. So they tell me I don’t have to pay excess anymore, just this amount. T keep giving me a tight deadline to transfer the money to them. I wanted to know EXACTLY what I was paying for. I asked for the invoices for repair (if you repair at a workshop there is an invoice right?) and the photos of before and after the repairs. T came up with a generic invoice (damage repair and spray paint and administrative fee) for the $Y just to shut me up. No photos. How to believe that they actually did the repairs? The workshop is under you, the car is yours, I can’t just take everything at face value right?

I asked for the workshop name, and more details with regards to the invoice. And the person told me that the repairs have not been done yet. Then how do you get the invoice? The person specifically told me that I can get the photos of the vehicle after I paid the amount, after they repair. I wanted to SEE the repairs before paying. I even offered to go down to the workshop and pay on the spot because T told me they can’t pay for the repairs before I pay up the amount. I OFFERED to go down and pay and everything. Guess what? They slap me with a “This is a final warning, pay by this date or we will take legal actions towards you” - kind of email. I just wanted to know the exact repairs done. It’s not that I want to avoid paying for this accident, I merely just want to know what I am paying for. Is that wrong?

After being in a turmoil for days, I have no choice but to pay up the amount, because I simply don’t have the financial means to ‘fight’ against T or be in a legal case over this. After paying that $700, T still continued to disable the account and I have tried multiple attempts writing in to the Customer Service, talking through the online chat, but it just seems like that account is being ‘blacklisted’ and they don’t care about any requests about that account.

I stopped using T ever since and closed my account, forsaking the e-money I have left in the account. A joke here is, my mom and I each have an account with T. So when I sent in two separate emails to request for termination of the accounts, guess what? T only replied to the email for my account, the one not involved in this incident. Totally ignoring the email for my mom’s account.

Throughout this entire thing, T (or R) keeps wanting to act as the liaison between the third party and me, saying that they will liaise with the third party to see if any payment or repairs is needed for their car etc. This is very suspicious and I see it as T (or R) wanting to act as the middleman and rip as much as they can from me (just my thought). I tried contacting the third party by myself but he seems to be ignoring my messages or seem to have arrived at some form of agreement with T (or R). There are also other ‘suspicious’ points, like asking me to pay up $2,000 with no concrete details and subsequently arriving at another amount. What if I have actually paid the $2,000?

EVEN TILL NOW, after paying that $700, I have yet to see a single photo of the repairs done (that was promised by T) or where exactly repairs were even needed (lol). It’s like paying up the money because T asked me to pay up and threatened me with a legal case if I don’t. I didn’t see where my money went to. *That is the most infuriating/unjust part of this entire thing*.

I have evidence of emails/chat conversations/pictures for the things I mentioned above. A part of me really wants ‘justice’, but I am really not in the position to fight against a company. Just want to rant everything here as a form of closure for me, before the year ends.

In total, I have lost around $1,500 (not a small sum to me), excluding wasted time, emotional/mental stress that I had to go through with regards to this incident. I am looking to try car sharing services again, but definitely from somewhere else, somewhere less shady.

Lesson learnt: for car rental (or car sharing) companies, sure, they are cheap and affordable, but if you get into an accident, they *will* do everything to rip you off. Technically, they aren’t doing anything wrong or against the law, and I understand this is how they ‘make money’. But it just makes me feel shortchanged and unjustified. I don’t feel good/satisfied with the random numbers they throw me and expect me to just abide and pay up. I know I am at their mercy, having read the contract and agreement before deciding to rent the vehicle, but come on, at least make me pay up the money feeling more convinced.

Despite this being a rant, I do have a legitimate question:
1. Is there any governing authority that regulates and oversees the rental car market? More specifically, the repairs and motor workshops, ensuring fair and reasonable repair charges. LTA? CASE? VICOM? OneMotoring? I will even go to the MP if it helps (next time if it happens again)

tldr; sorry no tldr, I can’t summarise the incident without missing out on important details

Yes there are some ITE students who cause troubles, but it's not representative of the entire ITE student body. A [NUS professor was charged with dangerous driving](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/maserati-driving-nus-professor-charged-with-dangerous-driving), but that doesn't mean all the NUS staffs do it. A [NTU professor was charged with stealing from a petrol kiosk](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/ntu-prof-admits-stealing-s450-worth-goods-petrol-kiosks), but it doesn't mean the entire NTU population steals right? Some [ACS(I) and St Andrews students fight over a rugby match](http://news.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20100413-209958.html), but that doesn't imply that the entire school population goes around fighting people right?

So why the hate? My best friend, and some of the best people I met, were from ITE. They are selfless people, and help others whenever they see people in need. Compare this to the more ""elite"" students who hail from well-known schools or education levels, where most of them are competitive and have the ""every man for himself"" mentality, and don't help others because they feel it would put them at a disadvantage. Talk to an ITE student, and it's quite unlikely you get the same vibe from them.

I was from JC, my sister was from poly, and my brother is currently studying in ITE, and I couldn't be anymore prouder of them. They are doing something they like, in courses they're interested in, unhindered by societal expectations (read: must go JC and then uni to be considered successful - don't pretend, I know some of you think this way). My brother received several educational awards for his outstanding performance, something that I never managed to in my entire journey as a student.

And I wonder why my mother said yesterday that my brother entering ITE was a setback for her. I am super proud of my brother, more than I am for myself.

I realised it's not so much of younger generations, as they seem to be more accepting of friends from various backgrounds (although [outliers](https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/insult-over-ite-background-leads-fight-temasek-poly) exist). It seems like most of the issues come from the older generations with their outdated mindset. My brother experienced an instance where he boarded the bus in his uniform and an aunty immediately left the seat and went somewhere else. My brother is not someone who sweats much and he stays in an aircon room most of the time for his lessons hence there's no BO, so the rationale is very clear here.

It's disappointing how we treat the people of our future. These are the people who are going to be compassionate and caring in life, and yet we treat them like dirt.

221,singapore,150098,Story on NUS' fixation with KPIs taken down? I wonder why...,aehlt6,mediageekery,1547113798,41,1,"[Original link](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/opaque-policies-fixation-kpis-rankings-why-arts-and-humanities-academics-quit-nus-ntu) doesn't work anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

 SINGAPORE — Opaque tenure and promotion policies, resistance to innovation and a “warped” notion of institutional excellence have surfaced as reasons some academics in the arts and humanities fields threw in the towel at Singapore's two biggest universities in the last couple of years.  


The National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) do well in attracting talented faculty members in the short term but fail to retain them — no thanks to their incessant pursuit of rankings and the relative lack of academic freedom when it comes to certain projects or research initiatives, about 10 academics — who have either recently left or are leaving the two universities — told TODAY.  


Such turnover of staff, some of whom had wanted more teaching opportunities but were under pressure for research output, will ultimately have a negative impact on students, said the academics, who have moved on to universities overseas.  


TODAY recently reported that eight lecturers quit in as many months at NUS’ communications and new media department, resulting in some modules being discontinued and anxiety among some students.  


Academics who left NUS and NTU — which cater to the bulk of undergraduates studying arts, social sciences and communications in Singapore — said there were deeper and pervasive issues affecting the faculty members in these fields particularly. However, in response to TODAY's queries, the two universities said the turnover rates at these faculties were not high but they did not disclose any numbers.  


NUS said the total number of academic staff at its science faculty and arts and social sciences faculty has been “stable” over the last three years. The turnover rate for academic staff at these two schools has also declined over the same period, said an NUS spokesperson. NTU said the turnover at its College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences is comparable to other faculties.  


Decrying the leadership’s fixation with key performance indicators (KPIs), philosophy professor Axel Gelfert, who left NUS in November 2017, said: “There is an eagerness on the part of some middling university managers to second-guess which policies the Education Ministry (MOE) might come up with next, and try to meet those KPIs before they even emerge. This means an ever-shifting maze of policies and guidelines which can literally change overnight.”  


Prof Gelfert joined the Technical University of Berlin as a full professor at the end of 2017 after spending a decade at NUS, most recently as an associate professor.  


“I now feel I am at a university that is run by academics for academics, not a subordinate unit enacting KPIs it receives from the head office,” he said.  


Historian John DiMoia left NUS at the end of 2016, 15 months after he was offered tenure. The milestone, which many academics strive for, drove his experience with the university downhill.  


“There were people at my door constantly checking on how much I was producing and publishing,” said Dr DiMoia, who is now Associate Professor of Korean History at Seoul National University.  


International university leaderboards place strong weight on the strength of research at each institution. For instance, academic peer review and citations per faculty make up 60 per cent of an annual ranking published by higher education marketing firm Quacquarelli Symonds (QS). English magazine Times Higher Education places 30 per cent of its ranking on citations and another 30 per cent on volume, income and reputation of research.  


NUS and NTU are placed 11th and 12th, respectively, on the QS rankings.  


According to some academics, the schools’ fixation with the numbers game leaves faculty members little bandwidth to properly teach and has driven away some who are more devoted to that aspect of their professorship.  


Said political scientist Woo Jun Jie, who left NTU in December 2018: “The real problem is a systemic overemphasis on research outputs over other forms of innovative academic activities, be they pedagogical innovation or community service.”  


For Dr DiMoia, “life turned into hell” when he tried to fight for more teaching opportunities after being asked to focus on research upon his tenure. “The managers did not take ‘no’ for an answer. Someone from the department even defaced my door in the office during my sabbatical,” he said.  


Education Minister Ong Ye Kung pointed out in September last year that international rankings currently place more weight on the quality of academic papers published by a university. “So, if there is a change I wish for or an improvement I wish for in the international ranking system for universities, it will be to evaluate the effectiveness of a university in collaborating with the world outside of academia — industries, society, communities, government — and delivering impact in all these sectors,” he had said.  


In particular, he singled out the great potential for collaboration in social sciences and the humanities for academia, the social services sector, communities and governments. Adding that researchers in these fields need to examine issues of the day “in a robust, evidence-based, scientifically rigorous, outcome-focused way”, Mr Ong added: “In this pursuit we should allay the worries that a social scientist has no future doing local research.""  


OPAQUE POLICIES  


The so-called KPIs are also constantly changing at the local universities, resulting in tenure and promotion policies executed in a haphazard, “random” manner, said the academics.  


“Standards of promotion and tenure are not made clear. Even when they were clear at the time of appointment, they can change suddenly,” said Dr Gelfert.  


Noting how the higher-ups at the universities often overrule recommendations made by specialist panels, he said: “While no tenure and promotion procedure is perfect, the level of internal distrust at NUS is astonishingly high. As a result, erratic and unpredictable decisions get made.”  


A humanities professor, who will be leaving NUS after being denied tenure and promotion despite having an “exceptionally strong” dossier backed by his department, said the provost had a “warped” view of research excellence.  


“His manner of conveying what he thinks is ‘excellent’ to the rest of the university is counterproductive and smacks of poor leadership... (he) is bent on improving NUS' ranking through a haphazard approach of gaming various ranking systems as quickly as possible,” said the professor in his mid-30s, who asked to remain anonymous.  


Business professor Ho Teck Hua was promoted to take on the roles of NUS' Senior Deputy President and Provost in January last year. The 57-year-old specialises in marketing, decision sciences and behavioural economics and was previously with the University of California, Berkeley.  


NUS and Prof Ho did not respond to the former academics' criticism of the provost.  


Dr DiMoia said he had former colleagues whose promotion and tenure prospects were reviewed for up to two years “for undisclosed reasons”. In a Facebook post in December, Dr DiMoia commented that NUS' history department — which he referred to as a ""certain department in (the university's building) AS-1"" — saw a ""double digit"" attrition of faculty members between 2014 and 2017.  


NUS and NTU websites have some details on term contracts for staff members, but no information on promotion processes. This is unlike some reputed colleges overseas such as Yale University in New Haven and the University of California in Berkeley, which have published their advancement criteria, appraisal process and salary scales online.  


Asked about claims that their policies lack transparency, NUS and NTU maintained that promotion and tenure review is a rigorous and “multi-level” process that has remained consistent across all faculty members.  


Both education and research are important considerations for recruitment and retention. Assessments involve both internal reviewers and external referees, the schools added.  


“This is in line with best practices adopted by top universities around the world. A candidate’s education performance is judged by student feedback for courses taught as well as through peer assessment reports. In addition, each candidate is evaluated on the impact of his or her research achievements compared with academics of a similar standing from peer and/or aspirant institutions,” said the NUS spokesperson.  


NTU offered a largely similar response, adding that information on promotion and tenure policies is available to staff via the university's intranet system. “The provost also conducts dialogues with faculty members, together with deans and chairs, to discuss promotion and tenure matters and facilitate in-depth understanding of the processes and expectations,” said the university's spokesman.  


The MOE said autonomous universities “make their own decisions and policies regarding staff recruitment, promotion and tenure”, taking into account the individual’s contributions across teaching, research and service.  


“In reviewing these policies, they adopt best practices from established universities worldwide,” said its spokesperson.  


'RESEARCH QUALITY, PERSONAL HEALTH AFFECTED'  


The rush to climb global university leagues has led to a fixation with certain types of research, typically in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) fields, inevitably sidelining other research, academics said.  


A former member of NUS' Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences said it was challenging to research on systemic social issues in Singapore because the work was ""under scrutiny"".  


Prof Gelfert lamented the lack of funding for the humanities, citing how scholarship offers in the philosophy graduate programme fell to an all-time low of 1.33 towards the end of his stint. “The university, which is dominated by engineering, medicine and quantitative sciences, remained unresponsive to the special needs of arts and social sciences... the humanities are seen as mere teaching facilities by both the rest of the university and MOE,” he stated.  


Other observers have also called for the universities to support Singapore-specific research. Last month, Prof Linda Lim and Prof Pang Eng Fong, who are emeritus professors from the University of Michigan and Singapore Management University respectively, wrote in a commentary published in South China Morning Post: “Research, the lifeblood of academia, is valuable to the nation and the world. So there must be a secure place in our universities for local tenure-track faculty and others doing local research that may not be published in highly ranked international journals or contribute to global university rankings.”  


Speaking to TODAY, Prof Lim added that high faculty turnover makes it difficult for universities to build a distinct ""scholarly identity"" that can be recognised globally, which will make it challenging, in the long run, to attract new faculty and graduate students. ""Nobody wants to invest scarce time and effort in developing relationships and partnerships with people who are likely to leave within a few years,"" she said.  


These institutions will also incur financial costs in searching for and recruiting new people, diverting time from the core activities of teaching, research and service, she added.  


Several academics told TODAY that working under the high-pressure conditions with little flexibility for academic innovation had caused their mental health to take a hit.  


Dr Andrew Quitmeyer, who left NUS’ communications department in December, said he was a “nervous, paranoid, depressed wreck” towards the end of his two-year stint there. Dr Quitmeyer, who studies intersections between wild animals and computational devices, found it challenging to design an interesting curriculum when “I felt like pulling my teeth out even planning basic things like field trips”.  


“(The university) had plenty of money, what they wanted was ranking-bait. They just wanted to game metrics...I grew incredibly depressed and wouldn’t be able to leave my bed for whole days at a time,” said Dr Quitmeyer.  


Despite their grouses, most of the academics consider their interactions with students a highlight of their academic careers at NUS and NTU.  


Dr Quitmeyer, for instance, said teaching NUS students has been “one of (his) biggest joys”. “They have so much potential and thrive in incredible ways if you just give them the slightest bit of freedom and personal responsibility. I was happy to see my students develop and bloom, and I pray that somehow NUS fixes itself to embrace their own talents instead of chasing metrics and chasing the pointless prestige of others,” he said.  


“I think the impact of frequent movements is strongest on students, especially when good teachers leave. Furthermore, relationships that are formed between students and faculty are disrupted,” said Dr Woo, who will join the Education University of Hong Kong to work on education policy in East and Southeast Asia.

 We were classmates in primary school but have gone to different schools in secondary school but still keep close contact.

Ok, so this is how it goes. A week ago my friend in Sec 1 was using iPads during an art lesson.  When he returned the iPad the teacher found a crack.

The teacher told him he might have to pay for the repair.
   For some reason, he ACTUALLY DID.
 We found out when he lost a challenge we did, and he couldn't pay us. (it was only $4 in total)

 We asked why he couldn't pay us that small of an amount, as he was generally richer than us. He proceeded to explain that he had to pay for the screen repair of the iPad with the money he saved.

 He proceeded to explain, then we asked why did you and your parents not fight back.

 He said:""Oh they tried.""

When they clearly didn't. He then said it was because of religion and all that. He's Buddhist. I'm Buddhist. my other friend who I'll call A is helping me in the argument is not, he is an atheist. My 1 other friend, who I'll call S helping him is Buddhist. My other friend, who I will call W was on both sides and is atheist. The friend A and I are trying to help shall be called Y.

 A and Me told Y and his family to stand up for themselves, as it is a false accusation, and they shouldn't take the blame for someone else's wrong doing. He then gave us shitty excuses like ""Oh it's fine"" ""Does it matter who pays for it"" ""I'm kind"". I asked him if some random African kid who is really poor can afford to pay that. He ignored the question.

 They have their sets of arguments which I will just put here.

-	religion and morals are not the same thing
-	and that you shouldn’t mention it lightly
-	being able to say something without it having critiqued as a religious stance
-	respecting other religious beliefs
-	acknowledging that you should listen to others even when (in your opinion) that their opinion is bullshit 
-	moving on with life; respecting that it is the decision of others
-	especially when it doesn’t involve you at all
- people being in the same religion doesnt they are the same (or think the same)

 A,W and Me tried to convince him to argue with the school, but S and Y said ""it is already over"" and ""why pursue the matter"". A and Me told them that Y's money was literally being stolen, and we recommend them to get his parents to make a complaint to the school, and sue if it fails, (if it's possible, not sure) because he had done nothing wrong.

 It was at this moment, I asked everyone:""Wait, doesn't the school keep track of which class borrows the iPads? Why did they not check for cracks?""  A said: ""Schools are supposed to teach us to have Integrity, tell the truth."" I followed it up with ""The school isn't being Responsible by not checking the equipment.""

 Y argued that if he were to sue the school, teachers can lose their jobs due to such a small matter. (Don't understand how that would work but our debate about that wielded no results)

After that, it was really us insulting each other.
Eventually, it stopped.

 A then thought of the idea of posting this on r/singapore to ask adults with better understanding of the law to help us with this and give us advice.

 So I ask for anyone to help us with this, we look forward to any reply. Thank you for reading.

227,singapore,155496,"77 years on, is Total Defence Day still relevant?",aqrkcl,CrossfittJesus,1550196027,36,1,"Today, we commemorate Total Defence Day.

We all know the history - TD Day is commemorated every year on 15 February to mark the anniversary of the fall of Singapore in 1942.  It's been a while since I left school, but [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/adfui4/what_are_your_memories_of_total_defence_day/) a while ago rekindled my memories of celebrating TD Day...where our schools would do funny things like turn off all the lights and fans to simulate the lack of electricity, give out food coupons to buy only either sweet potato and peanut porridge, and of course, the usual lesson on the five pillars of Total Defence and what it meant for us, etc.

As every year passes, the group of Singaporeans who lived during the war gets smaller and smaller, as age catches up. I would think that, as a result of that, today's younger generation (and future generations) would begin to see Total Defence as more of a feel-good campaign, rather than appreciating the true essence from which it began - remembering that in 1942, our country fell to an aggressor nation; a prelude to over three years of foreign occupation, tyranny and suffering. This got me thinking - how relevant is Total Defence today? 77 years since the fall of Singapore, how important are the areas of military, civil, economic, social, psychological (and now digital) defence? Has it largely become something we simply commemorate every year, or is there still some deep relevance in today's modern society? Allow me to share some of my thoughts (and as always, **feel free to drop your comments :-)**)

# We are our own worst enemy

In my opinion, Singapore is but a victim of its own success. Ever since we regained our way of life in 1945, to independence in 1965, to SG50 in 2015 and today, it is hard to disagree that Singapore, as a society, has advanced rapidly to become one of the leading cosmopolitans in the world. Strong economic and foreign policies, coupled with the determination of a young nation striving to make a name for itself,  has really brought us to become a bustling city and global hub within the Southeast Asian region. But at what cost? Well, not being exposed to a truly life-changing hardship at a societal level tends to make us *very* comfortable at where we are, and as such, gives way to the tendency of us ""dropping our guard"" and letting complacency seep into our everyday way of life. We sometimes read with great incredulity accounts of the ""strawberry generation"" or millennials - a ""soft"" generation of entitled individuals who strongly believes that society owes them privileges as their rights, and yet struggle to endure hardships as a result.

It is in this regard that I think Total Defence is relevant, because it is a constant reminder for everyone (not just students or even, lol, civil servants)  that we cannot take our successes for granted and that we must continually bear the reminder that we need to always be ready for any challenges to our way of life. More importantly, it forces us to remind ourselves that we are not all that great or even experts at becoming successful, but we got to where we are because of the sheer grit of those before us to weather hardships, and a determination to better the lives of people around them; and just like our forefathers, we ought to embody this same spirit to ride on our successes, but always with a constant vigilance to remain rooted and never complacent because of our successes. I guess also in this regard, the tenet of social defence comes into play, because the challenges we face as a society will really test the strength of how we Singaporeans come together despite differences and unite as one. If anything, reading news like how Singaporeans rallied together during [the unfortunate demise of Aloysius Pang](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/hundreds-of-people-at-wake-of-aloysius-pang-to-pay-their-respects), or to the [defence of the Gojek driver](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/fair-outcome-reached-for-gojek-driver-and-passenger-in-viral-video-over-alleged-kidnapping), or even to [demand justice for the heinous mistreatment at the Platinium Dogs Club](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/shanmugam-urges-calm-over-dog-facility-saga) shows that we indeed have the potential to unite together, which is extremely heartening to know.

# Digital as the new defence

If you read the news yesterday, it was announced that, [starting this year, there would be a sixth pillar of Total Defence - Digital Defence](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-digital-defence-pillar-added-total-defence-framework). Naturally, the main reasons cited for this addition was because of the growing importance of strengthening cybersecurity, and ensuring that Singapore stands ready to respond to threats in the digital domain. Given that we live in an era of fake news, spying, data leaks and the like, I thought that it was a pretty relevant (and necessary) addition to the spirit of Total Defence (after all, it is about each and every one of us coming together to ""play our part"" in defence). We've seen the many dangers that fake news can do to shape people's perceptions and opinions of things, and thus I believe that the digital world will be a necessary fight and fortification in the coming years, so that we as a society can be more discerning to the online content we see everyday on social media and elsewhere.

# Old World Blues with New World Challenges

In the last few months, there is no hiding that we have disputed, confronted, and trashed out our differences in our beliefs and approaches to common issues with our neighbours up north (I've posted extensively my thoughts on the issue [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aepky5/seriously_is_malaysia_trying_to_take_the_mickey/). Feel free to read them!). To put it simply (and referring from [Darrion Mohan](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/singapore-student-takes-on-mahathir-at-oxford-union)), we are but victims of an old adversary who operates with ""confrontational diplomacy and barbed rhetoric""...akin to the days of old, and as a result, are unwillingly embroiled in a [series of disputes over sovereignty and territory](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-malaysia-hold-discussions-on-maritime-boundaries-dispute). Given this, I would think that two tenets of Total Defence - military and psychological defence - has still a huge relevance in today's world, and *ESPECIALLY* so given recent events.

Since WW2, Singapore has never found itself involved in proactive armed conflict, barring peacekeeping missions overseas and acts of terrorism. Because we have enjoyed peace for 77 years, I feel that we have become somewhat disillusioned at the need for a strong sense of commitment to defence, and as a result, see a steadily growing sentiment questioning the need for NS and/or a large SAF. While I do recognise and admit that it is not really an equivalence (although both countries are frequently cited as being similar in nature), comparing Israel with Singapore really helps to illustrate my point that our circumstances often dictate our psyche. As you may already know, Israel has been embroiled in a longstanding and protracted armed dispute with its neighbours for years on end. I would think that the constant threat of military offensives over territorial disputes somewhat reinforce the belief in Israeli society that having that capacity to defend themselves was of utmost importance, as well as being psychologically fortified to have that will to fight for the survival of their country.

As such, it is my belief that the need to hold onto the relevance of military and psychological defence today is stronger than ever. While it is very tempting to throw in cliche sayings like ""you cannot own what cannot defend"" (lol), I guess my main point here is that *this* is the time, perhaps more than ever in the last 10-15 years, that we *need* to recognise the importance of NS and having a strong SAF. Everytime the debate on the need for NS rolls about online, I always somehow see the same narrative of ""why NS when there's no war"", or ""why the need for a strong SAF"".....if anything, a strong military and psychological defence (i.e. a strong armed forces with a united body of citizens standing strong behind them with an unwavering commitment to defend their home) is but the right answer in the current circumstances. We may all have our differences in many respects (e.g. politics), but the one common denominator that underpins our very nation is the mental fortitude and resilience of our people to always be ready to defend our way of life against anyone who threatens otherwise.

Outside 5 Figaro Street, there are white painted lots... That don't have an accompanying parking sign or prices displayed. I honestly have no idea whether it's private lots, URA lots? It's all painted officially with white lines, but there are no parking signs or prices displayed. Neither are there signs stating this is private land, no trespassing, no authorised parking, etc.

I found the last available lot, which was blocked with a dust bin. I had already flicked on my hazard lights, and was deliberating whether I should move the dust bin or not, whether it's worth risking a potential right, etc.

Next thing I know, a white BMW pulls up behind me and has his turn indicator on.

He was waiting behind me for 20-30 seconds, so I came out of my car to check in with him.

I'd like to be clear, I was not aggressive at all.

The conversation went like this:

Me: Are you waiting for this lot?

Him: Yes, this is my lot.

Me: It's a public lot leh.

Him: I live here, this is my lot, they reserved for me already! *more aggressive tone*

Me: Can like that meh? 

Him: You go call LTA lor! Call LTA!

I decided it was not worth the fight (especially with my wife and baby in the car), so I decided to just drive off.

However, I was of course put off by this.

What's everyone's opinions on landed residents using dust bins to block lots?

I'm not talking about blocking the space in front of their house - that's still up for debate.

21 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A whole galaxy of characters and faces anyone can recognise at first glance. Quotes from almost every movie that we could relate to almost every situation in our daily lives. Visualise yourself being a kid in this day and age, watching amazing role models like Captain America, Spider-Man and Iron-Man (debatable) and to actually see them on screen and just let their imagination run free. If I went back in time and told my 14-year-old self about the evolution of Marvel now, he would probably call me delusional. A kid needs that. This is an outlet for all their daydreams, imagination and to find a hero they can relate to. And no time is better than now.

And now, what are heroes without villains? We have been treated to an amazing array of villains across the years. Villains that thread the line for us because their rationale and objectives are in the right place, but their methods are questionable. Amazing thought-out and characterful villains like Thanos, Loki, and Vulture, just to name a few. But then we also have the straight up evil villains, with only one goal in mind: Destruction. Whether for revenge or just pure spite, some examples of them are Malaketh, the Chitauri and Ronan The Accuser.


But see, there’s a special kind of villain that is not easy to understand or spot. They are the epitome of evil itself. They are self-centred, selfish, opportunistic and have no sense of remorse, doing what they do for self-gain and not sparing a single thought about others. They are the very thing that goes against the all values that the Marvel Comics and MCU incorporates to their heroes. Granted, they are not the most powerful or intimidating villain, they attack in hordes and if their actions go unchecked, they will win. 

I am speaking, of course, about the Carousell Scalpers. My friends, they are hindering our youth and depriving them of the opportunity to watch their favourite heroes on the silver screen. They are depriving us of our emotional attachment to the whole story arc, an arc that we all have invested so much of our being and emotions in for over the last decade. They are taking away our very right to enjoy ourselves. They are taking away our freedom to express and feel something we hold very dear to our hearts.

This cannot stand.

I implore you, do not entertain such monstrosity. If we cannot kill it, we shall contain it. Let the country know that we will not take such cruelty without a fight. Let the plague kill itself. Do not let desperation take control and use that as an excuse to seek them out. Let them realise the real heroes are those who stand by their morals and will not be moved by their act of cinematic blackmail. Some are fair, and to them, we can offer our aid. But to those doing it out of pure greed, they will not win. We owe it to those not in the theatres with us to try.

Doesn't matter what their reasons are. Doesn't matter what the politicians or the law says. Doesn't matter if the whole country decides that something wrong is something right. 

This nation was founded on one principle above all else: The requirement that we stand up for what we believe, no matter the odds or the consequences. When the government and the law and the whole world tells you to move, your job is to plant yourself like a tree beside the river of truth, and tell the whole world -- 

""No, YOU move.”

Admittedly as a Masters student, I've taken somewhat of a huge interest in the topic, seeing as it is related to what I'm studying at the moment. After reading yesterday's news about the conclusion of the [Singapore and Malaysia Leaders' Retreat](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-malaysia-leaders-retreat-forward-looking-relationship-11425048) and the various announcements/key highlights from the press conference, I'd thought I help everyone summarise what it all means, plus my own thoughts on the current state of Singapore-Malaysia relations (**I'm of the opinion that, despite all the positive news and posturing coming out of the joint statement by PM Lee and Dr Mahathir, it's actually just back to a zero sum game and no real progress has actually been achieved, at least for Singapore**...but more on that later). Of course, everything written here are my observations and opinions (have to state that in case I kena fake news law...heh heh), and please feel free to comment and let me know what you think!

# Quick Context

Unless you've been living under a rock all this while, you'd probably know by now that Singapore and Malaysia have been embroiled in disputes over several fronts, ever since late 2018. Just to set the context, here are some of the key disputes:

* Extension of Johor Port Limits encroaching into Singapore's territorial waters
* Dispute over Singapore's implementation of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) at Seletar Airport because it hinders high rise development of Pasir Gudang
* Malaysia's insistence of the unfairness of the water agreement with Singapore
* Malaysia's request for a delay of key projects previously agreed upon, such as the RTS Link and the High Speed Rail

With that in mind, yesterday's retreat was an important milestone for both countries, particularly because while the retreat is an annual affair (its ninth iteration this year), it is the first Singapore-Malaysia Leaders' Retreat for the newly minted Pakatan Harapan government. Notably, this retreat [was supposed to have taken place last November, but got postponed at the request of Malaysia](https://mothership.sg/2018/10/msia-spore-leaders-retreat-postponed/). Nevertheless, both leaders and their delegations finally met yesterday, and issued a joint statement detailing some of the outcomes from the retreat (you can read the [statement in full here](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/joint-statement-pm-malaysia-singapore-leaders-retreat-11425594))

Even though it may be heartening to see headlines such as ""[Singapore, Malaysia affirm commitment to cooperative and forward-looking bilateral relationship](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-malaysia-leaders-retreat-forward-looking-relationship-11425048)"", we have to realistically take into account what has actually been worked out with regard to the various issues discussed, and be frank and honest with ourselves on if this was even considered progress towards better bilateral relations. Here's the kicker: **I actually don't think any progress was made (and even if there was, it was hardly significant)**. If anything, it seems as though a Time Stone was used to revert to how things were late 2018, which then leaves us with nothing more than a stalemate for the time being (hence, my opinion that we're back to **a zero sum game in the state of bilateral relations**). It also shows how much work has to be done in the various aspects given the significant differences of both countries, as are their approaches to resolving them.

# Territorial waters dispute

You may already know that, with regard to the territorial waters dispute, [both countries have agreed to suspend their overlapping port limit claims, and revert to the original limits in Oct and Dec 2018](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/overlapping-port-limit-claims-suspended-by-singapore-and-11421458) (In Oct, Malaysia suddenly extended its port limits of Johor that encroached into Singapore's waters, and Singapore responded in Dec by extending its limits off Tuas. In addition, [both Malaysian vessels seem to have sailed off](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bapgc0/according_to_the_reservist_both_malaysian_ships/), after having taken turns anchoring in Singapore's waters over the past few months. The conclusion on this is that a high-level committee will look into the issue, and work together for an amicable decision for all.

Has progress been made, at least for Singapore? My opinion is that it **remains to been seen**. While there is progress in that tensions seem to have de-escalated since now there is the lower likelihood of any nasty encounters at sea between both countries' vessels, we can only wait and see what are the outcomes from these negotiations. Notably, Malaysia had also announced a new ship-to-ship transfer hub project in Johor, with Mahathir claiming that Singapore was already long notified and consulted about the project (funnily enough, [Singapore stated that it had not received any knowledge about it](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-no-information-malaysia-ship-hub-johor-project-11416232)...someone has to be BSing here right?). While details of the project are not known yet, I highly suspect that it will somehow infringe upon Singapore's territorial waters, given Mahathir's constant insistence that it will be in Malaysia waters.

# Airspace dispute

Earlier this week, both countries' Transport Ministers met and issued a statement highlighting that [Malaysia would indefinitely suspend its Restricted Airspace in Pasir Gudang, while Singapore would withdraw its ILS](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-seletar-airport-ils-malaysia-suspends-pasir-gudang-11418642), and that both countries would work on a GPS-based system for Seletar instead. While some may see this as a win-win situation for all, I'd beg to differ here, and posit that actually, it is somewhat of a loss for Singapore. Here's why: Up till recently, the implementation of the ILS at Seletar Airport has been of a non-issue - it has guaranteed a safe landing approach for all aircraft, and contrary to what Malaysia claims, does not violate Malaysia's sovereignty. My theory here is that Malaysia's first implementation of the 'Restricted Airspace over Pasir Gudang for military activities only' is **just so that it can be used as a bargaining chip to coerce Singapore into giving up the ILS, under the guise of friendly bilateral cooperation**. To use an analogy (hopefully I get this right here, I'm usually not too good with analogies haha): I*magine you are managing a food court at a shopping mall, and under an arrangement, get to keep 70% of profits plus be pretty autonomous with your management decisions. One day, the mall management suddenly decides to restrict the number of people entering your food court, citing some unworldly reason that it was because of safety precautions. Both you and the mall argue and negotiate back and forth, until the mall management decides to propose that if you are willing to give up another 10% of your profits, they will (in the spirit of good partnership and showing they are willing to cooperate and compromise) suspend this crowd restriction policy.*

Later on after the retreat, it was announced by Mahathir that [Malaysia plans to take back management of its airspace from Singapore](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/9th-leaders-retreat-mahathir-malaysia-delegated-airspace-stages-11425622?cid=fbcna), after it was first delegated to Singapore to manage in the 1973 by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (an arrangement that Malaysia had then agreed on). Immediately off the bat, I have to question if this is the right outcome for aviation safety in the region, given [Malaysia's non-reassuring history of aviation safety](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/jul/30/mh370-final-report-released-by-malaysian-government-live) as well as [poor crisis management](https://www.globalreinsurance.com/what-the-missing-malaysia-airlines-mh370-case-reveals-about-poor-crisis-management/1407586.article), in this case the management of aviation incidents. Technically, Singapore has nothing to really lose from not managing the Flight Information Region of the area. However, when one considers this issue in tandem with Malaysia's expansion of its port limits, **it seems as though Malaysia is attempting a slow game of reducing Singapore's presence and influence in the region, and conversely increasing its posture**.

# Water agreement

This is probably the biggest bugbear that Malaysia has - that Singapore is currently paying too little for drawing up to 250 gallons of raw water per day from Malaysia at 3 sen/gallon, a legally-binding arrangement inked in 1962. While Malaysia has been pretty vocal about their position on the issue, PM Lee (at the conclusion of yesterday's retreat) made Singapore's position very clear: [Malaysia had lost its right to review the price when it chose not to do so in 1987](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-malaysia-to-start-talks-on-maritime-boundary-delimitation-within-a-month), and (obviously) you cannot just go about reneging on terms from a legally-binding contract.

Watching the full video of the joint statement, I noticed that PM Lee mentioned that he ""can understand his (Mahathir's) perspective why he sees a political necessity to press hard for water price revision"". From this, it seems to be that really, the underlying reason as to Mahathir's hardline stance on the water agreement is really because there is a pressure to be seen to be ""fighting for the people"" and iron cladding PH's public impression that it is a government willing to fight for the rights of Malaysians, at any cost. Previously, there has been much discussion that PH is just using Singapore as a bogeyman to distract its local populace from the teething societal problems and struggles with governance, and frankly, I'd be inclined to think so too. The takeaway from yesterday is that both countries' attorney generals will meet to discuss the legal implications, but really I only hope that we can be assured that even though Malaysia claims that the current arrangement and pricing is ""unfair"" to them, they unarguably benefit from this arrangement too because Singapore sells water back to them at a price lower than if they would have treated the water themselves, plus that we, when called upon, would [readily provide additional supply of water if they needed it](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-supplies-additional-treated-water-to-malaysia-at-johors-request).

# Conclusion

On a whole, while many things have been said at the conclusion of the retreat yesterday, I don't think that any real headway has been made (in terms of progress); rather, we've only prolonged the game and increased the berth of our playing area. Publicly, the commitment has been made to improve bilateral ties, but in reality, it's more or less remained status quo in the 'negotiation' phase. If anything, both Singapore and Malaysia are unique in a way that I think you can not find any two other countries that share the same relationship as we do, and so the struggle here is that we really cannot fall back on the age-old method of ""what did other countries do?"", and it will have to be on both governments to chart the proper direction for Singapore and Malaysia. We can only wait and see what comes to fruition from these committee-level negotiations, and hopefully in the days to come, can finally rest assured that we are moving towards better days for the region.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bbgrkb/the_state_of_singaporemalaysia_relations_after/,0.0,['B.']

But TODAY understands that separate laws will be tabled at a later date to deal with the threat.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; NEW MINISTERIAL POWERS\n\n&gt; The 77-page Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill gives all government ministers the power to issue a variety of orders, such as directing online news sites to publish corrections to falsehoods.\n\n&gt; In extreme cases, they will be able to order the publisher to take down an article or order Internet service providers to disable user access to errant sites.\n\n&gt; Ministers will also be able to order that the revenue streams of errant online news sites be cut off, by prohibiting them from soliciting revenue as well as barring companies from advertising on such platforms.\n\n&gt; They will be able to direct tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter to disable fake social media accounts, including those that use bots to amplify falsehoods.\n\n&gt; Ministers will also be able to issue general correction orders. That is, if a false statement has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to the victim’s reputation, a third party such as the mainstream media can be ordered to publish a correction, to draw the public’s attention to the falsity of the statement or to a corrected statement.\u200b\n\n&gt; CRIMINAL SANCTIONS\n\n&gt; The new laws on fake news will not target individuals who innocently share a fake news post or article. In short, they will not be prosecuted.\n\n&gt; Requiring online news sources to publish corrections alongside the falsehoods will be the primary response.\n\n&gt; However, “malicious actors” who deliberately use falsehoods to undermine public interest may be charged with criminal offences. They can be fined and/or jailed.\n\n&gt; Such offences include making false statements, programming bots to quickly circulate fake news, or not complying with orders issued by ministers.\n\n&gt; For instance, individuals guilty of making online falsehoods face a fine of up to S$50,000 or a maximum five-year jail term or both.\n\n&gt; On the higher-end of the spectrum, organisations that do not comply, say in removing fake accounts that use bots to spread falsehoods, could face a maximum fine of up to S$1 million.\n\n&gt; In the event that falsehoods are discovered during an election period, where the Government would have been dissolved, the “alternate authority” who can issue such orders will be a public officer appointed by a minister before the writ of election is issued.\n\n&gt; An alternate authority cannot be appointed during the election period.\n\n&gt; DEFINITIONS OF FALSEHOOD AND PUBLIC INTEREST\n\n&gt; Given concerns that the sweeping new laws might stifle free speech, the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) stressed in a statement on Monday that the Bill “targets falsehoods, not opinions and criticisms.\n\n&gt; “The Bill defines a falsehood as a statement of fact that is false or misleading. It does not cover opinions, criticisms, satire or parody,” it added.\n\n&gt; Ministers can only issue orders subject to the fact that the statements are falsehoods and that the orders are in the public’s interest.\n\n&gt; The legislation spells out the meaning of public interest, which covers six areas: Orders can be issued in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part of Singapore, to protect public health or public finances, or to secure public safety or public tranquillity as well as in the interest of friendly relations of Singapore with other countries.\n\n&gt; Other areas of public interest include: To prevent any influence of the outcome of a presidential or general elections as well as by-elections or a referendum; to prevent incitement of feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different groups of persons or to prevent a “diminution of public confidence in the performance of any duty or function of, or in the exercise of any power by, the Government, an Organ of State, a statutory board or a part of the Government, an Organ of State or a statutory board”.\n\n&gt; SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE\n\n&gt; In making its recommendations, the 10-member Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods also stressed the need for safeguards, to ensure due process and the proper exercise of power, given concerns raised during the committee’s public hearings that new laws could be used to stifle free speech.\n\n&gt; The new laws tabled on Monday include judicial oversight — the courts have a final say in determining whether a statement made is a falsehood.\n\n&gt; Still, ministers can take action in the time it takes to file a court application to quickly prevent the falsehood from spreading.\n\n&gt; Those accused of peddling falsehoods have the right of appeal to the High Court, but they bear the burden of proving that the statements made are not falsehoods. Such a principle can already be found in existing defamation laws, which is to discourage people from putting out a falsehood and turning around to say that it is for others to prove it is false.\n\n&gt; Similarly, Internet service providers and Internet intermediaries such as Facebook and Twitter can also make appeals to the High Court if they are found guilty of not complying with the rules.\n\n&gt; However, an appeal can only be made after the individual or organisation has gone to the minister to cancel the order but the minister refused to do so.\n\n&gt; FAKE NEWS LAWS ELSEWHERE\n\n&gt; Singapore’s new laws may perhaps be the most comprehensive yet in the global war against fake news, but other countries have made moves in the same direction.\n\n&gt; Governments around the world have been left increasingly frustrated with the lack of action by tech giants such as Facebook and Twitter to clamp down on fake news, peddled by local and foreign-state actors to stir social unrest and interfere in foreign elections.\n\n&gt; Several countries are looking to implement their own laws to crack down on the malicious use of online media and social media platforms.\n\n&gt; In the aftermath of the mosque shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand, the Australian government has announced plans to introduce laws this week that would prevent social media platforms from being “weaponised” to live-stream violent crimes.\n\n&gt; Some countries such as France, meanwhile, already have laws countering fake news. Last October, the French Parliament passed two laws to prevent the spread of falsehoods during election campaigns in response to allegations of Russian interference in the country’s presidential election in 2017.\n\n&gt; The country’s new laws allow a candidate or political party to seek a court injunction against the publication of falsehoods during the three months leading up to a national election and also targets fake news bots.\n\n&gt; Perpetrators could face a year in prison and a fine of €75,000 (S$114,165).\n\n&gt; \n\n---\n0.5.0-beta | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

Headlines about Muslims being threatening were extracted from this paper.  

## Initial Doubts

I found some of the language in its summary disturbing: 

&gt; It is also useful to challenge the notion of religiosity and secularity as mutually
exclusive and to study the possible coexistence of both religious and secular
identities. In countries like the United States, there is increasing polarisation
between religious and non-religious groups, with religious groups advocating for
less separation between church and state, and vice versa for non-religious groups.
Examples would be heavy lobbying by religious groups to legally prohibit or restrict
abortion, as well as same-sex marriage and the rise of **militant** secularists who
decry any influence of religious groups in the wider public space. Such tension and
legal contestation strains relations within society and should not be mirrored in
Singapore.

Strong language when referencing secularists.

&gt; These “**Skeptic Scrappers**” represent the perennial segment of less religious
people in society.

Derogatory adjectives for a category of *mostly* non-religious folk. For reference, scrapper means: *A fighter or aggressive competitor, especially one always ready or eager for a fight, argument, or contest.*  

&gt; These “Friendly Faithfuls”...

Complimentary adjectives for a specific segment of religious folk.  

My curiosity was piqued so I skimmed through the paper. As it turns out, some pertinent facts (given that the paper is about Religion in Singapore) weren't highlighted in the conclusion.
For example: 

&gt; There were marked differences when the results were analysed by respondents’
religious background. Christians were most likely to say they agree or strongly
agree that too much trust has been placed in science, rather than religious faith
(see Table 94). More than half of Christians (54.6 per cent) felt so, the highest
among all the communities. 

Some might say that a disdain for science could be a serious threat to Singapore given our future city/value creating economy aspirations.  

There were other curious bits, like Christians being omitted from the table on ""whether Muslims are threatening"" without explanation why. Hopefully someone with more time could do a thorough read.

## Basic Investigation

My casual read through left me with some doubts about the impartiality of the paper, so I did some googling. This came up: [Responding to Changing Family Realities](https://ethosinstitute.sg/tag/mathew-mathews/). It's an article for ETHOS institute, which is affiliated with NCCS (National Council of Churches Singapore). The following blurb follows the article:

&gt; Dr Mathew Mathews is a **Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies at the National University of Singapore**. He has researched on a number of family-related issues. He actively serves at Alive Community Church. These are his personal views.

Mathew Mathews also wrote [Fath At Work](http://saltandlight.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/faithatwork.pdf), ""A NATIONAL SURVEY OF SINGAPOREAN CHRISTIANS IN THE MARKETPLACE"". The paper's foreword was written by Lawrence Khong, a local mega church pastor.  

Here's an interesting extract from a TODAY [article](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/religious-identity-strongest-muslims-protestants):

&gt; Lead author, IPS senior research fellow Mathew Mathews, said greater religiosity among Muslims here was observed a few decades ago and coincided with increased global Muslim piety. Many Muslims in Malaysia and the region also take their religion very seriously and this is increasingly so, he noted. **As for Protestants, the dominant form of Protestant Christianity here is of a “conservative variety where there is an emphasis on doing the right thing”**.

## A Conflict of Interest?

Might someone as devout and outspoken about his faith as Mathew Mathews understate his faith's negatives? Might biases against other groups seep into his writing? Some would say such failings would only be human.  

**IPS studies play a role in policy making. To avoid engendering mistrust, IPS's secularity *should* never come into question. Considering that, things like labeling categories with a mix of derogatory and complimentary adjectives does not make sense: it adds little value but shreds away at IPS's secular veneer. Also, divisive language, like insinuating that some champions of secularism are *militant*, do not contribute toward building understanding and developing compromises.**

To be clear, it would be wrong to claim there is a conflict of interest **simply** because Mathew Mathews is a devout Christian. What do you guys think though? Anyone read through the entire study and found anything curious?

# Reflection on the Hundredth Anniversary of May Fourth - George Yeo

A hundred years ago, China was in such a weakened state, its appeal against injustice was ignored by the major powers. In 1917, China had joined the Allied Triple Entente war effort against Germany in the hope of regaining territories seized by Germany in Shandong. A China Labour Force consisting of 140,000 men was sent to Europe as China’s contribution. After Germany was defeated in 1919, the Treaty of Versailles agreed to the return of these territories to China but Japan took them over instead with the agreement of the other victors. Japan was intent on expanding into the Chinese Mainland. A few years earlier, in 1915, it made its infamous ‘21 Demands’.  

The Chinese people seethed with rage. In many Chinese cities, and among overseas Chinese communities, protests by intellectuals, students and workers were organized. The professors and students of Peking University convened the first meeting on the eve of May Fourth. Out of the protests emerged a collective resolve to shake off China’s feudal mentality and promote scientific development. A deep political transformation was necessary. The 1911 Revolution succeeded in overthrowing the Imperial System but what to replace it with was still a big debate. Mr Science was obviously indispensable. But who actually was Mr Democracy? On the left, a New Culture Movement believed it necessary to root out Confucianist thinking and behavior. Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao went on to found the Chinese Communist Party in 1921. On the right, seeking to reform rather than to expunge China’s two-thousand-year Confucianist legacy, a New Life Movement was launched by Chiang Kai-Shek in the 1930’s in opposition to the New Culture Movement. It was principally supported by the Kuomintang. One sought revolution; the other argued for gradual change. Both were united in their opposition to western and Japanese imperialism.  

China had still to go through another six decades of war and revolution before Deng Xiaoping set the country on the path of reform and opening up in 1978. After Japan’s defeat in 1945, China plunged into civil war. After Mao reunited the country (with the exception of Taiwan) in 1949, China went through the trials and tribulations of the Great Leap Forward and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Then, like a movie switching from black-and-white to technicolor, the world watched with astonishment China’s metamorphosis in the last four decades.  

A hundred years ago, the Chinese people looked themselves in the mirror and understood why the world viewed them with contempt. A hundred years hence, the Chinese people should look themselves in the mirror again and reflect on how the world view them today.  

The huge difference is that China, from being spat upon a hundred years ago by the major powers, is now increasingly feared by some of them. This is a dramatic change. It will be a mistake if the centennial message of May Fourth is a continued emphasis on standing up to foreigners. It was right for China a hundred years ago to be intensely nationalistic. That was in self-defense. The need today is not for clenched fists but hands of friendship. China can make this change because it is strong and will become stronger.  

Japan’s incursion into the Chinese Mainland led to its own destruction. Like a phoenix, it arose from the ashes with US assistance after the Second World War. It now longs to be a normal country again. The improving ties between China and Japan are good for all of Asia. Many of those who participated in May Fourth had lived in Japan and were inspired by its modernization including Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao, Lu Xun and Guo Moruo. So, too, Sun Yat-Sen who began the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty with the establishment of the Tongmenghui in Tokyo in 1905. Alarmed by the western ravage of China after the Opium War, Japan rushed to modernize itself to escape a similar fate. Partly in response to western imperialism and partly by its own choice, Meiji Japan became expansionist and participated in the carve-up of China. That history led to the long war on the Chinese mainland, the war in the Pacific, the horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and an era of subservience to the US. A new happier chapter in China-Japan relations is opening a hundred years after the Japanese action which sparked off May Fourth. The Japanese Government has recently expressed hope that China President Xi Jinping will attend the enthronement of the new Reiwa Emperor in October as a special guest after which the new Emperor will presumably make an early visit to China. China must however accept that Japan’s strategic relationship with the US is a precondition for the normalization of its relationship with China.  

China’s relations with the US are more complicated. The US sees the rise of China as a threat to its long held pre-eminent position in the world. Unlike the Soviet Union during the Cold War, China is increasingly viewed not only as a military and an ideological threat but also as an economic and a technological threat. In the last two to three years, anti-China sentiments suddenly coalesce. Many now talk about the Thucydides Trap and the possibility of war. China must manage this US reaction thoughtfully. Its growing self-confidence must not lead to an over-confidence which makes light of the fears of others. To be defiant in weakness a hundred years ago was necessary; to be arrogant when strong now will lead to tragedy. The US is finding fault with China over a range of issues. However, US bluster reveals a certain anxiety about its own condition. China should not forget that, among the western powers, the US was the least rapacious in China. The US was embarrassed to receive Qing Dynasty indemnity after the Boxer Rebellion and allocated part of it for Chinese students to study at MIT, Harvard and other American universities. Christian missions established educational and medical institutions like Yenching University and the Peking Union Medical College. For a number of years before Pearl Harbor, the US provided critical support to China in its war against Japan. Without the US weighing in after Pearl Harbor, it would have taken China much longer to defeat Japan. After Deng Xiaoping’s visit in 1978, the US opened its door to Chinese students. Large numbers in every field have since been educated. The US contribution to China’s development in the last forty years has been enormous. There is therefore considerable historical goodwill between the US and China which the centennial celebration of May Fourth should recognize and resurface.  

There is no single European reaction to China’s rise. Some European countries even accuse China of wanting to divide Europe. In fact, it is in China’s strategic interest for the EU and the Euro to be strong. Close relations with a strong united Europe help China’s relations with the US. This is a remarkable turnaround. The May Fourth Movement was fueled by anger against European powers ganging up to bully China. In 1898, they acted together to destroy and loot the Summer Palace. Now, China wants Europe to be united so that it can be an intermediate pole between itself and the US. There are issues of course like Belt and Road and, ironically, human rights. What has not changed in a hundred years, however, is an enduring Chinese admiration for European civilization and its remarkable achievements in philosophy, science and the arts. For every aspect of European civilization, there are Chinese experts distilling insights for China’s own development. Till today, the question of Mr Democracy’s proper role in Chinese society is being debated. All expressions of democracy in Europe, past and present, are being studied for their strong and weak points from Iceland’s Althingi, Britain’s Magna Carta and Switzerland’s Confederacy to current systems in Western Europe and the EU.  

An inseparable part of European civilization is Christianity with which China has had a love-hate relationship going back to the first millenium. In the 19th century, Christianity was associated with the western subjugation of the Chinese people. The conquest of a people is complete when they believe that the true gods are those of the victors. Not surprisingly, the New Culture Movement which received a strong push during May Fourth rejected not only Confucianism but also western ideas which facilitated the subjugation of the Chinese people including Christianity. The first act of rebellion is in the mind. To the radical left, the tolerance of Christianity by the New Life Movement and the Kuomintang was proof of their collaboration with China’s oppressors. Chiang Kai-Shek was a Christian, at least nominally. For the Chinese Communist Party, atheism was an article of faith. Not surprisingly, the PRC’s relationship with the Vatican was tortured. In the last few years, however, there has been significant improvement for two main reasons. First, China has become more confident of itself and fears less the threat of Christianity to its sense of self. China studies Singapore intensively and can see that the role of Christianity in Singapore’s predominantly-Chinese society is generally positive. The second reason is growing realization that the Vatican does not act at the behest of western powers. When China insists that Christianity must be Sinicized, the Vatican agrees wholeheartedly. Indeed, it is a moral principle in Christian teaching that God is in each and everyone of us, manifesting Himself in our identity. Therefore, God is also Chinese. With the provisional agreement on the ordination of bishops between China and the Vatican last year, all Chinese bishops are now in communion with Rome. At long last, the first papal visit to China is on the cards.  

After 1949, the Chinese people withdrew into themselves searching for a way to the future. It was a journey with twists and turns culminating in the absurdities of the Cultural Revolution. While the future is still full of uncertainties, the broad way forward for China has since clarified. It is of a China which is open to the world and contributing organically to its well-being. In the field of ideas, including the realm of human spirituality, a new creative encounter between Chinese civilization and other civilizations will enable mankind to confront common challenges like nuclear proliferation, climate change and religious strife. The early Jesuits were amazed that Chinese civilization could maintain a moral system without religion. They wrote about a scholar bureaucracy steeped in the moral classics, selected by public examinations, which enabled the good governance of a large part of humanity for long periods of time. Joseph Needham described China’s profound influence on the Encyclopedists in the 18th century, on men like Voltaire, which laid the anti-clerical foundation of the French Revolution. Few remember today that the elite civil service of France has its origin in China. The rediscovery of China’s philosophical traditions in the 21st century will open an interesting new chapter in western thought in the same way as the discovery of Europe’s philosophical traditions by Chinese thinkers, including Socialism and Marxism-Leninism, once leavened the New Culture Movement. A continuing dialogue between east and west will redound to the benefit of both. Some of the romance in that dalliance should be recaptured, an intimation of which we could detect during Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Italy.  

In India, China meets a kindred civilization and spirit. Each bows before the other as an ancient people. Both suffered western aggression. Both responded comprehensively and each, in its own way, is recovering its place in the front rank of nations - not as Westphalian but as civilizational states. When Ravindranath Tagore visited China in 1924, he felt for the plight of the Chinese people. His writings had inspired many of them. Chen Duxiu even translated Tagore’s most famous work ‘Gitanjali’ into Chinese. Guo Moruo was inspired by Tagore while studying in Japan. In Singapore, Tagore persuaded Tan Yunshan to head the Cheena Bhavan (China House) in Vishvabharati, his university in Santiniketan. On his visit to India in 1942 to rally support for the war against Japan, Chiang Kai-Shek met Mahatma Gandhi in Calcutta. He visited Santiniketan and donated a collection of books to the university library. In 1957, Chou En-Lai also visited the university and donated a second collection of books. Despite Tagore’s close ties with Japan, he condemned its invasion of China in the 30’s. Apart from a short border war in 1962, largely forgotten in China but still an open wound in India, there has been no major conflict between them. However, there are issues which have to be carefully managed like border disputes, Pakistan and the Dalai Lama. Considerable distrust still marks their bilateral relations. A better recollection of the centuries of contact between China and India can help soften mutual antagonisms. Indeed the transmission of Buddhism from India to China is one of the greatest stories every told in human history. The revival of Nalanda University recalls part of that story as an inspiration for the future. China without Buddhism would be like a portrait with a colour missing. Good relations between China and India in the 21st century will be a great blessing for Asia and the world.  

After a hundred years, China needs a new New Culture Movement which positively reconnects it to the world in every direction. If the China Dream is not to become a nightmare for some, there has to be a deeper appreciation of their fears. This must come from the heart. May Fourth was a cry from the heart. To be sure, China continues to worry that there are elements in the west, in particular the US, still wishing it ill. China sees US policy on Taiwan, the South China Sea and Xinjiang as deliberately malign. While there is some justification for this concern, China should also be concerned that others increasingly worry that it is turning the table against them. China is now too big to take a low profile and hide its shine. Drawing from its own philosophical inheritance, China must find a way to shine brighter without outshining others beyond emphasizing common interest and common benefit. The I Ching reminds us that history moves in cycles. Those who are triumphalist hasten their own decline. The centennial celebration of May Fourth should therefore be a call for the China Dream to become part of man’s global dream. The struggle for our common destiny is the May Fourth spirit.  

It gives me great pleasure to speak on May Fourth this evening to alumni of Peking University in Singapore. Peking University played a critical role in that movement and celebrates its anniversary every year on May Fourth even though the university was established in 1898 during the Hundred Days’ Reform of the Guangxu Emperor. The professors, students and alumni of Peking University are inheritors of a proud tradition of understanding the Chinese condition to change it for the better.  

The May Fourth Movement had a profound impact on ethnic Chinese all over the world as the way others treated them was inseparable from the way they treated China. In Singapore, the Chinese living here were swept along by the New Culture Movement. Chinese business associations, cultural organizations, schools and newspapers were all profoundly affected. The Chinese in Singapore also became politically active. They supported China’s resistance against Japan’s invasion of the Mainland and suffered for it during the Second World War. After the War, the Chinese worked with other racial groups to fight for independence. Ten years ago, Lee Huay Leng encouraged me to write a piece on the 90th anniversary of May Fourth. In it, I said that May Fourth is an important part of Singapore’s rich inheritance. The May Fourth spirit is an integral part of the Singapore spirit. It is therefore right that we also celebrate the centennial anniversary of May Fourth in Singapore sharing a common dream to make this a better world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bkuz8m/reflection_on_the_hundredth_anniversary_of_may/,0.0,['So what’s his take on June Fourth?']

But how does that not go the same for service staff?  


But today, in my first time in over 100 hours of working at my part time job, I was scolded for literally just asking the customer if he needed help.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario:

I was walking around the store and noticed this customer looking around the slightly more expensive area of the shop and was holding ""x"" brand item. The brand is rarely bought as it is expensive and a slightly less popular brand so I was interested to help him.   
I walked over and asked if he needed assistance/help, and he said ""No I don't!""

And he just turned the box over and I just curious to what it was just looked and the item and read what it was and said/mumbled extremely softly ""Oh""

He immediately (literally like 1 second later) said ""Can I not browse by myself!? I don't need your help! Did I ask you to help me?"" in a extremely condescending tone and stared at me like as if i'm trying to pick a fight with him or insulted him in some way. 

So I just said sorry and left.

&amp;#x200B;

Well it might just be my pet peeve of being hated of getting scolded for something that I didn't deserve but well my mood was ruined for the day and didn't have much mood to help out other customers...

TLDR: From my experience, F&amp;B gets it rougher than Retail... and this is just a little ranty but, just a reminder to treat others nicer and spread positive vibes instead of being negative and being a cunt to others.

246,singapore,165009,[Unpopular opinion] about the recent saga of Monica Baey,bgbm2u,chingchongcheng84,1555990976,566,932,"From FB

&amp;#x200B;

The recent saga of Monica Baey has taught me one thing: That the internet is a scary place to be in.

Within hours of Monica posting her instastory, my Facebook feed erupted with people reposting her story, adding comments about justice not being served/ condemning NUS for sweeping the matter aside and merely asking Nicholas to write an apology letter to Monica/ raging that NUS, Singapore and the world are unsafe places for girls and women because perpetrators like Nicholas get to escape with only a slap on his wrist. Petitions were quickly passed around to give Monica a voice, and to call for stiffer punishments for Nicholas (such as expulsion) and those who commit sexual offences on campus. Many internet vigilantes began digging up similar incidents that occurred in NUS, and many also began naming and shaming Nicholas, his girlfriend and their family.

This is why I think the internet is scary.

1. No one bothered to check the facts of the case. People were satisfied with the information that they received off of Monica’s instastory, and began going on a social media rampage. What if her story was fake? How different are you from the aunties who forward whatsapp messages in the groupchats?

2. Don’t get me wrong, I am not saying that her story is fake, but what if it really was? Would anyone have been able to tame the wildfire? Before NUS could have responded, internet vigilantes had already began digging out information about Nicholas and his loved ones, and blasting them all over the internet. How much damage would that have caused them?

3. Now that NUS has addressed the issue, many people still thought that the decision was unfair. The internet went crazy, enough to get NUS to set up a committee.  
a. However, many failed to understand that the 12 months conditional warning was issued by the police and the AGC, and not NUS. It was also not issued by the judiciary.   
i. Instead of banging the bottoms of your pans, has anyone asked why was there only the 12 months conditional letter given? Why was there a petition for the school to do something about this issue, but no petition for the police or AGC to address it?

b. NUS suspended Nicholas for one semester. He was also banned from entering Eusoff Hall, and he had to undergo mandatory counselling. A lot of people thought that this was not enough. The question then is, how much is enough? Do we use the Penal Code as an anchor and gauge from there? How do we quantify sexual offences in order for punishments to be enough? Why do people enjoy playing God, in deciding what is enough?

c. The number of cases that the internet vigilantes dug up show that this is not the first time that such an offence took place in NUS. Why has there been a repeat of such offences time and again? What exactly is NUS doing to ensure that such incidents stop once and for all?

I applaud Monica for raising these issues so that people become more aware of the situation. I applaud the people who stood alongside her and gave Monica the voice she needed. I am glad that mental health and the need to cope are acknowledged. However, I am also disappointed in my community in the way in which we have responded to this unfortunate incident. We are basically aunties on the “orh hor” bandwagon who name and shame.

Think for a minute of the other victims who thought that this saga and the events that followed, would give them a voice. Will they truly get a voice? No. Instead, the perpetrator’s name, details, and pictures will be plastered all over the internet. They would have to confront the perpetrator and the incident all over again. Most importantly, their privacy would be taken away from them as well. Are we actually giving them a voice, or scaring them into keeping silent?

I encourage you to also think about the person who committed the sexual offence. Is deterrence enough? We smack him on the knuckles with a feather duster, then we put his name all over the internet, then we make him lose his job. When is it enough? Do we stop when he commits suicide?

Ask yourself why did Nicholas commit such an act? Ask yourself what have we been doing in schools, at home, and in our community, that have encouraged such behaviour/ could stop such behaviour from manifesting? Ask yourself, how is Nicholas coping? How do we help him to move on from this? As a community, we stand in solidarity with the victim of such offences, but we need to know that destroying the lives of an offender does not make the situation any better. It makes it worst for the person, his family and loved ones. Is it fair for them to also have their faces and information planted all over the internet? How will they ever move on from this? Shouldn’t we as a community help them through?

What about the other offenders? Have we scared them off? What about those who actually need help? Will they be too scared to come forward?

This is why I think that the internet is scary. We choose the people that we want to fight for. Where were your voices and petitions when other people were victims? We name, shame, and destroy. In a country where its people are the only resource, it is disheartening to see us so quick to tear each other down.

249,singapore,174906,Referendum of same sex marriage.,c5oukg,24cmshorter,1561549727,33,0," 

Hey everyone, welcome to the very first episode of Kopi Talk; a podcast I started to talk about the state of affairs in Singapore, from socio-economics issues to issues on bread and butter. Since it is pride month, I would be touching on LGBT issues in this session. 

The main question I’m going to raise in this session is: are our human rights violated? I know many people think our human rights have been violated but I beg to differ. The first thing we should rightfully do is to define human rights. According to the United Nations, human rights are rights inherent to all human beings, regardless of race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, or any other status. 

It would then make sense to include the freedom of love in the list of human rights.

However, contrary to popular belief, I do not think our freedom to love or freedom of love has been denied by the state. Sure, there’s an archaic law condemning homosexual acts and the fact that same-sex marriage is not recognised by the government but the fire in our hearts we hold dear will never be extinguished. No one can take that away. Our freedom is to love, is not and will never be denied.

This is where I draw the distinction between human rights and the rights of a citizen. And I suggest we all take a step back to think about the semantic differences of the definition of human and a citizen and how they form the basis of my criticism.

I believe the freedom to love, either a product of evolution or a result of our biology, constitutes as a human right, which would be impossible to deny even if the state does not recognise between the matrimony of a same-sex couple.

And since marriage is essentially a social construct, it should not be classified under human rights.. It would be logical to think of this social construct, to exist outside of the sphere of rights humans inherently deserve. 

The right to marry, understood as the rights of a citizen, is therefore subjected to democratic processes of the nation where the elected government reflects the conservative or religious sentiments of the majority in this legislation. I’ll touch more on this later.

The right to marry is something we have to accept or fight for, which is evidently Pink Dot’s agenda. Another option, in my opinion, is to wait for the next cultural shift.

This begs the question. Is Singapore a secular state? Should we accept same sex marriage against the religious views of the many? A recent headline would suggest otherwise. Info-Communications Media Development Authority, commonly known as IMDA, revoked a band’s permission for the performance on the morning of the concert, after being advised by the Ministry of Home Affairs to do so. I’d assume you know what happened. Never mind the negligible impact of the lyrics on the youth. If we look at the cause and effect relationship of the religious nature of the petition and the draconian ban holding other factors constant, this incident points toward the undeniable fact that Singapore is not a secular state even if they claim they did it in the name of religious harmony.

The second question on your mind right now should point toward the impact of not recognising same sex marriage on the right to housing. Article 25 under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to a standard of living which includes housing.

This is where I would like to again point out the semantic differences between human rights and the rights of a citizen. We would definitely have some questions if we look into ancient history, a time without a government, where people occupied land they claimed. The questions we would ask ourselves are.

Does a person have the right to the land he simply claimed? Who does it belong to? Does it belong to us humans? Or does it belong to the animals that roam the land. Democracy aside, to put things into perspective, I would like to argue that housing is not a human right but the rights of a citizen. It is the duty of the government to provide for the people since land is part of a country’s sovereign rights, the very same rights the people give to the government.

This brings us back to democracy and why we should accept things as they are while we wait for the next cultural shift. Our system is one of a representative democracy which in theory assumes people are voting for the right representatives to lead the country. However, more often than not, democracy in practice votes for representatives who share the same sentiments and concerns as the people. Evidently, the ability to lead and reflect the same sentiments are not mutually exclusive.

The main question we have to ask ourselves is. Are they afraid of losing votes in the name of progress? Supporters of the LGBT movement might think yes but I’d like to point out the duty of the government to the people. PM Lee has once said Singaporeans are not ready yet which I agree since the majority is a religious and conservative bunch. Therefore, the best option is to wait for the next cultural shift. Leading to our golden years, what happens when our generation and the generations after us become the majority? The deciding vote becomes ours to make and our future leaders will reflect our sentiments toward same sex marriages. And in the future, the skeptical voice in you might think the government is pandering to voters by legalising same-sex marriages to remain in power. But the truth is, democracy in practice votes for the representatives who share the same sentiments and concern for us. And again, I’d like to remind you, we do not share the same timeline with the nations that have legalised same-sex marriages. America invented nuclear bombs before Singapore was independent. The time will come for progress. We just have to wait.

Another issue with not recognising same-sex marriages is the issue of discrimination. Do we simply accept the state of affairs at our expense which is in the form of discriminatory housing policy? What can we do about it? What can the government do? Our society needs to progress. Progress in the name of eliminating discriminatory housing policy. According to Prime Minister Lee, society isn’t ready for same sex marriages and the repeal of 377A. The implied consensus is oppressive in nature. We deserve the freedom to vote as the citizens of Singapore. A referendum like the one done in the UK which gave UK citizens the choice to vote to stay or leave the EU. Maybe then we will accept the results, even if it means we lost. But I guess that’s democracy.

In conclusion, I believe we should respect the democractic process we have in Singapore even though there wouldn’t be any negative impact on society if we allow for same-sex marriages. The time for the LGBT community will come, as it has in the numerous countries that have finally accepted same sex marriage. Emphasis on finally. And I hope I’ve appeased both sides of the same coin by making the distinction between our basic human rights and the rights of a citizen clear.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/c5oukg/referendum_of_same_sex_marriage/,0.0,['ok']

So unlike in the U.S., ride-hailing transport is a game-changer for the entire social and economic infrastructure of Southeast Asia, including Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. That’s 620 million people — twice the size of the US, including 12 cities of 2M+, of which the US has only four. And the middle class in SEA is expected to double in a couple of years to over 400 million.

Probably not the wisest thing to do: trash your former employer whilst still high on the promises of the new job. And I think it's overly simplistic to compare SEA with USA.

256,singapore,173019,"New evidence of age bias in hiring, and a push to fight it",c18ypw,HelloWorld0921,1560684800,6,14,,https://www.todayonline.com/world/new-evidence-age-bias-hiring-and-push-fight-it,0.0,"['&gt; # New evidence of age bias in hiring, and a push to fight it\n\n&gt; MADISON (ALABAMA) — Across the United States, mammoth corporations and family businesses share a complaint: a shortage of workers. As the unemployment rate has tunneled its way to a half-century low, employers insist they must scramble to lure applicants.\n\n&gt; The shadow of age bias in hiring, though, is long. Tens of thousands of workers say that even with the right qualifications for a job, they are repeatedly turned away because they are over 50, or even 40, and considered too old.\n\n&gt; The problem is getting more scrutiny after revelations that hundreds of employers shut out middle-aged and older Americans in their recruiting on Facebook, LinkedIn and other platforms. Those disclosures are supercharging a wave of litigation.\n\n&gt; But as cases make their way to court, the legal road for proving age discrimination, always difficult, has only roughened. Recent decisions by federal appeals courts in Chicago and Atlanta have limited the reach of anti-discrimination protections and made it even harder for job applicants to win.\n\n&gt; It is complicating an already challenging juncture of life. Workers over 50 — about 54 million Americans — are now facing much more precarious financial circumstances, a legacy of the recession.\n\n&gt; More than half of workers over 50 lose longtime jobs before they are ready to retire, according to a recent analysis by the Urban Institute and ProPublica. Of those, 9 out of 10 never recover their previous earning power. Some are able to find only piecemeal or gig work.\n\n&gt; ”If you lose your job at an older age, it’s really hard to get a new one,” said Mr Richard Johnson, an Urban Institute economist who worked on the analysis.\n\n&gt; “YOU COME IN, AND YOU’RE DOA”\n\n&gt; Mr Tom Adair dressed in a sharply pressed white shirt and a blue blazer with gold buttons for the weekly meeting for ExperiencePlus, a group for job seekers over 50 held in the small library at St. John the Baptist Church in Madison, Alabama, near Huntsville.\n\n&gt; A former quality manager at Toyota and an Air Force consultant, Mr Adair said he has had temporary consulting assignments over the past decade but has not been able to get a steady full-time job since the recession’s nadir in 2009.\n\n&gt; “I ace the phone interviews,” Mr Adair said. “They say: ‘Your resume speaks volumes. You could hit the ground running. It looks like you’re the perfect fit.’ ”\n\n&gt; “But you come in, and you’re DOA,” said Mr Adair, who is 71 and has neatly clipped gray hair. “You can see the look in their eyes.”\n\n&gt; “My wife says: ‘We need to get you a face-lift. We need to get your hair dyed,’ ” he said.\n\n&gt; Older workers are much more likely to wrestle with prolonged joblessness than younger ones, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. On average, a 54-year-old job hunter will be unemployed for nearly a year.\n\n&gt; Repeated inquiries can go unanswered, like space probes lost in a distant galaxy. In one of the most comprehensive studies, resumes were sent out on behalf of more than 40,000 fictitious applicants of different ages for thousands of low-skill jobs like janitors, administrative assistants and retail sales clerks in 12 cities. In general, the older they were, the fewer callbacks they got.\n\n&gt; Those in their 60s “never do better, and often do worse,” than those a decade or two younger, said Mr David Neumark, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine, who oversaw the research.\n\n&gt; It is toughest for women, who suffer more age discrimination than men starting in their 40s, the researchers found. “The evidence of age discrimination against women kind of pops out in every study,” Mr Neumark said.\n\n&gt; As for Mr Adair, he said he had been through the same job-application routine so many times that it felt like “Groundhog Day.” Over the years, he consulted three lawyers about age discrimination. Each time, they advised that an individual lawsuit would not be worth the legal costs.\n\n&gt; With a small pension and Social Security, he said, he and his wife are “just getting by.”\n\n&gt; “It’s devastating,” Mr Adair said. “You go through the stages just like dying. First you can’t believe it. You’re so sure and your wife is so sure, and even the recruiter is. Then you get mad.” By the end, you feel like giving up, he said.\n\n&gt; “THE RESTAURANT WAS LOOKING FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE”\n\n&gt; Hiring complaints and lawsuits are rarely filed because they are difficult to prove and the cost is high, said Mr Robert E. Weisberg, a regional attorney with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Florida.\n\n&gt; To bring a case against Seasons 52, a national restaurant chain, Mr Weisberg said, the commission looked to establish a pattern of bias over a period of years by combining statistical analyses with testimony from applicants.\n\n&gt; The agency examined whether the chain could have hired so few applicants 40 or older if there had been no age discrimination and calculated the odds at less than 1 in 10,000, according to court documents. The commission also collected affidavits from 139 applicants at 35 restaurants.\n\n&gt; Mr George Simmons was 45 when he applied at a Seasons 52 in Lone Tree, Colorado, in 2014. “My interview was going well until the interviewer asked me my age,” he stated. After he answered, he said, he was shown the door. “I asked what was the problem,” he said, “and the interviewer responded that the restaurant was looking for younger people.”\n\n&gt; Ms Heidi Barsaloux was 44 when she applied for a bartender position at a Seasons 52 in Schaumburg, Illinois, in 2010. “An interviewer told me that they were not looking for people with that much experience and wanted people who were more green,” she said.\n\n&gt; A third applicant was told, “We are not looking for old white guys.”\n\n&gt; Ultimately, the chain, part of Darden Restaurants, agreed last year to pay $2.85 million and hire a monitor to prevent discrimination against applicants over 40. As part of the settlement, the chain denied any wrongdoing.\n\n&gt; There have been other legal offensives.\n\n&gt; The Communications Workers of America has filed a lawsuit on behalf of millions of older Americans against Amazon, T-Mobile and Cox Communications, accusing them and hundreds of other major employers of systematic age discrimination in hiring based on targeted online advertising.\n\n&gt; The union and several workers have also filed complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against more than 70 employers and employment agencies related to age discrimination in recruiting. It expects that some of those will turn into class-action lawsuits.\n\n&gt; By exposing so much of the help-wanted process on the internet, “the transformation to digital recruiting has shined a spotlight on how discrimination happens, and it’s made it much easier to do so,” saidMr Peter Romer-Friedman, a lawyer at Outten &amp; Golden working with the union. “We’re going to start going after these companies, one by one.”\n\n&gt; THE LEGAL HURDLES HAVE BECOME TOUGHER\n\n&gt; Mr Dale E. Kleber had been out of work for three years when he saw a posting in 2014 for a legal position at CareFusion, a medical technology company. At 58, with three of his four children living at home, in a suburb of Chicago, he was feeling the financial strain of prolonged unemployment.\n\n&gt; So even though the ad specified that applicants should have no more than seven years of experience, Mr Kleber applied. CareFusion ended up hiring a 29-year-old.\n\n&gt; Mr Kleber, a veteran lawyer and former general counsel of a national dairy and food company, sued, arguing that a limit on experience effectively ruled out older applicants.\n\n&gt; “Litigation is a terrible way to settle disputes,” said Mr Kleber, who during his career had defended companies against complaints filed with the EEOC. “It’s a very uncertain process, it is fraught with risk, and sometimes it comes out wrong.”\n\n&gt; Putting a cap on experience, though, “just seemed so egregious,” he said.\n\n&gt; The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did not agree. In a ruling this year supporting CareFusion, it stated that recruiting practices that have the effect of screening out older applicants — what is known in legal terms as having a “disparate impact” — did not violate the law.\n\n&gt; The decision mirrored one involving R.J. Reynolds Tobacco made earlier by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, which the Supreme Court declined to review. It ruled that unlike employees already on the payroll who can show that a policy has a negative effect on a group regardless of the motivation, applicants would have to prove intentional discrimination.\n\n&gt; Mr Troy Kirkpatrick, a spokesman for Becton Dickinson and Co., which owns CareFusion, said, “We are deeply committed to providing equal employment opportunities and a workplace free from discrimination, and as such we are pleased with the decision from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.”\n\n&gt; In April, Mr Kleber and the AARP Foundation asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case.\n\n&gt; “It defies common sense,” Mr Kleber said, to think Congress “intended to offer greater legal protections to people who have jobs than people looking for jobs” when it passed the Age Discrimination in Employment Act in 1967.

The fact that Singapore has a high number of millionaires per capita is simply irrelevant if the poorest of Singaporeans have a roof over their heads and can make ends meet.\n\n&gt; Inequality is about a gap in numbers and speaks nothing of the socio-economic mobility of the poor.\n\n&gt; If inequality is all that matters, then the poor would be better off in Afghanistan and Thailand, which rank better than Singapore on Oxfam’s Inequality Index, but that’s hardly the case.\n\n&gt; As one of the co-founders of The Philosophy of Life, the organisation that hosted Mr Brook’s dialogue series in Singapore, I would like to address some of the arguments that have been raised in response to his article.\n\n&gt; MORAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RICH\n\n&gt; The central premise of the arguments asserting that inequality matters is that the rich must be morally accountable to uplift the poor.\n\n&gt; First, it is unclear why it is reasonable to prescribe the rich moral duties to the poor, especially in Singapore. Unlike countries marred with political corruption and a history of colonialism, wealth accumulation in a free marketplace like Singapore is an outcome of voluntary mutually advantageous transactions between individuals. Thus, there isn’t a zero-sum game with the rich coming out on top at the expense of the poor that compels any form of moral responsibility.\n\n&gt; The proposition that the rich must redistribute their wealth as a means to return the favour to society for enabling their success doesn’t make sense either.\n\n&gt; With regard to consumers and workers of the poor and middle class, businesses have fairly reciprocated by distributing wages consented to by their employees or transacting goods and services at prices desired by their customers.\n\n&gt; Moreover, the rich are already shouldering a higher burden of taxes through corporate taxes and being taxed in the highest income bracket, the money going to fund public goods such as roads and schools.\n\n&gt; Just because privileges are unearned doesn’t make them wrong. Inherited privileges are blessings that shouldn’t be frowned upon as they are incentives that motivate both rich and poor parents to work selflessly in pursuit of a better future for their children. Thus, it is perplexing to me how anyone would deem it moral and just to expropriate these privileges on the mere basis that others need it more.\n\n&gt; INADEQUATE SOCIO-ECONOMIC MOBILITY\n\n&gt; Another point that is frequently raised is that while we should not aim for equal outcomes, at a minimum, the rich ought to compensate for the different starting points we begin with. The critique fits well with the perennial narrative that the rich have steamrolled so far ahead of the poor and middle class that social mobility is out of reach.\n\n&gt; However, the narrative does not match up to the unrivalled record of free markets to produce wealth and socio-economic mobility for the masses.\n\n&gt; Globally, the world has halved absolute poverty in 15 years, meeting its UN Millennium Development Goal set in 2000, five years ahead of schedule. Domestically, Singapore’s poor has witnessed similar progress. Basic wage has increased 7.8 per cent for local low-wage employees, which is higher than the increase for all rank-and-file workers at 5.5 per cent in 2018. In addition, Oxford-based research centre, Our World in Data, observes that inequality has not risen from 1990 to 2015, but has fallen marginally.\n\n&gt; Only in a free marketplace is wealth the most dynamic and where people have the capacity to move across the income spectrum.\n\n&gt; The rich can only sustain their privilege through serving their consumer markets better or funnelling their capital into the right hands. Thus, as the rich get richer, the poor get richer too as there is an ever greater abundance of opportunities to invest, work and enjoy products and services that make all of our lives more meaningful and productive.\n\n&gt; Confiscating wealth and then redistributing it till we attain an equity of opportunities is not only an impossible endeavour but an unproductive one that penalises success and obstructs the creation of wealth for rich and poor alike.\n\n&gt; If socio-economic mobility is an ideal we aspire to particularly for individuals who are less fortunate, then it is incumbent upon us to welcome and maximise the abundance of opportunities for them through free markets.\n\n&gt; SOCIAL FRAGMENTATION\n\n&gt; The claim that too much inequality ferments damaging divisions between the rich and poor by eroding social trust needs to be questioned too.\n\n&gt; In my view, it’s not inequality per se but rather, whether the inequality has accrued fairly, that troubles Singaporeans.\n\n&gt; A recent behavioural economics study by Nature Human Behaviour journal revealed that people weren’t actually averse to inequality. In an experiment, participants were tasked to distribute rewards to two cleaners. Initially, they would split it equally between the cleaners but when they discovered that one of them cleaned more diligently than the other, they much preferred an unequal distribution of rewards.\n\n&gt; The sole means to guarantee that inequality is a fair and just outcome is to embrace meritocracy. Only in such a setting does merit prevail and arbitrary political privileges, ethnicity and religion are overridden.\n\n&gt; Ironically, it’s our obsession with inequality that amplifies the differences among us and cultivates an unhealthy “us versus them” tribalistic mentality.\n\n&gt; Certainly, it is more productive to redirect our focus on poverty instead, which is an effective rallying point for both the rich and middle class alike to come together and work out solutions.\n\n&gt; All in all, we must strip away the default presumption that the free marketplace, where inequality is permissible, is ruthlessly disadvantageous to the poor.\n\n&gt; According to research by the Fraser Institute, a Canadian public policy think-tank, the bottom 10 per cent of income earners worldwide consistently hold 2 per cent to 2.8 per cent of the share of their respective nation’s income regardless of their redistribution or welfare policies.\n\n&gt; Interestingly, it observed that the average income of the poorest 10 per cent in the most economically free nations is almost twice the average per capita income in the least free nations.\n\n&gt; Inequality is a constant in life and a reality in all societies.\n\n&gt; What’s not constant is absolute poverty, which we’ve made great strides in eradicating and must continue to do so by treating inequality as nothing more than a red herring.\n\n&gt; organisation that hosted the dialogue series in Singapore by Mr Yaron Brook, the chairman of the California-based non-profit think-tank, the Ayn Rand Institute, where Mr Don Watkins is a senior fellow.\n\n---\n1.0.1 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

Over the past week, I was harassed and eventually assaulted by a middle-aged woman over a matter that was none of her concern and she is currently defaming and doxxing me online by posting photos and videos of me with false allegations. She started a witch hunt against me and I have already reported her to the Police multiple times.

The full story: When I moved into this neighbourhood with my dog, I noticed that there was an extremely aggressive stray cat that would stalk [Clip of stalking behaviour](https://gfycat.com/complexneatant) my dog and even run up to us to attack my dog. It scared my dog so much that whenever we go downstairs, he starts whining and getting extremely anxious, looking around for the cat. The situation became so bad that my dog started getting nightmares and whining in his sleep. There were even residents who saw the cat attack my dog and some of them tried to help me scare it away but the cat kept coming. I did not report the cat to NParks as I did not want it to be put down, so I tried various ways to avoid the cat. It wouldn't work however, as the cat would wait directly outside the lift to attack my dog. On different occasions, I have had to shield my dog and I sustained claw and bite marks from the cat, racking up medical bills.

Apparently, I was not the first victim of this cat. A resident I know had also told me that the very same cat attacked her son before. There was also another stray in the area (let's call it Patches) that would constantly be attacked by this cat. I hear them fight at night and whenever the aggressive cat was around, Patches would be sitting high atop a letterbox to hide from this cat.

I made a report to NParks and when they came over to take my statement, I specially requested for them to rehome the cat instead of culling it. They noted my request and said that they would contact the Cat Welfare Society to process the rehoming. 3 weeks after I made the report, the cat was still not caught and it once again attacked my dog. This attack left me with [deep wounds](https://imgur.com/a/DFZQLvg) that bruised on my legs and deep cuts that would not stop bleeding. I even had to get a tetanus shot.

The next night, I was walking my dog as usual when I noticed that a strange woman was watching me from the 2nd floor. She came down and confronted me about the report, demanding to know which floor I lived on. I told her that the cat was extremely aggressive and that if she owned the cat, I will be expecting her to pay the medical bills. Instead she kept denying that it was her cat and then proceeded to demand that I walk somewhere else (How can I, when the cat waits outside the lift?). I immediately disengaged her and walked away, then called NParks on my phone. She followed me and impeded me from walking my dog, then demanded me to hand over my phone. Then she took photos and videos of me. The NParks officer said that he did not know how this woman found out I reported the cat and advised me to return home immediately. As I returned to the lift, this woman started shouting and cursing at me, calling me a ""cat killer"" and trying to get neighbours upstairs to ""stop me"". I hid in my house as I was afraid she would harm me and an hour later, the NParks officer called again and said that I should make a police report. I did and when the police arrived, she was gone. They simply told me to call them if she harasses me again.

The next day, I went downstairs to walk my dog as usual when the woman came down from the second floor again. She shot menacing glances at me and I took out my phone in case she would try something. She was also carrying an empty cat crate. She became extremely agitated and started shouting at me and approached me. She then said she would take photos and videos of me. I immediately called the police and she turned around to try and get away, so I walked towards her and told her that I called the police and she should stay. She screamed and falsely claimed that my dog attacked her. I was stunned. She continued walking away so I trailed behind to ask her to stop. When she got to the roadside, she started taking a video of me, shouting ""I WILL TAKE A VIDEO OF YOU NOW. I WILL TAKE VIDEO"". At this point of time I called the police a 2nd time and as I did, she continued to shove her phone extremely close to my face. Annoyed, I tried to take a video while trying to block her camera with my hand. She drops her phone and immediately shouted ""YOU THROW MY PHONE!!"" and before I could respond, she hit me in the face and [broke my glasses](https://imgur.com/a/PtIiOIA). She then [pushed me to the ground](https://imgur.com/a/fpfM271) causing my phone to drop as well and she started to hit me multiple times in the head. I did not defend myself for fear of it working against me so I simply grabbed onto her leg. She continued hitting me while screaming that I was assaulting her. When she finally stopped, I let go of her leg and an old lady helped me up and told me to quickly go home because the woman was crazy. My assaulter then ran towards a group of people and told them that I had assaulted her, before walking back to us and shouting ""I HAVE EYEWITNESS!"". At this point I was extremely fearful for my dog's safety and my own. My dog was scared and I couldn't see very well as she had broken my glasses. I quickly ran upstairs to get contacts and return my dog to my house and when I rushed back downstairs, she had fled the scene. I waited around for the police to arrive but they never did so I walked over to the station to file a report and also had to pay out of my own pocket for medical attention for the injuries she caused me. She walked away with no injuries. The police simply told me that Voluntarily Causing Hurt was non-arrestable and advised me to go to the State Court.

3 days after the assault, a friend informed me that the woman had posted a defamatory post of me on Social Media. She had included photos and videos of me and even my address. She gave false information that I wanted the cat culled in order to garner sympathy for herself and used the incident to ask people to **donate** money to her. She had apparently caught the cat and was boarding it somewhere. She falsely alleged that I attacked her and then made remarks that I was mentally unsound. She even limited the comments to be friends-only whereas her post visibility was public so that others would only see comments from those who supported her. She even trimmed the video she had of me to where she drops her phone so it would look like I approached and attacked her. Additionally she stated that she went around spreading the news to the entire block in order to hunt me down. It was also through her Facebook post that I found out she was actually affiliated with the Cat Welfare Society. Had she abused information to track me down? The Cat Welfare Society would have rehomed the cat anyway. There was no reason for her to be harassing me.

I have noticed people living on the same floor as her stalking/watching me when I return home. I have also incurred damages of over $700 so far because of her actions and yet every authority involved has been trying to dust their hands off this matter. The Cat Welfare Society in particular, did not respond to me at all on how one of their members managed to obtain my information. This woman has been the aggressor on all 3 incidents and she continues to make things worse by endangering me. The Police seem very confused as to how to carry out procedures and didn't even give me a police report for the first two times that I reported, which was necessary to file a dispute. I was counting on the Police to show up and they didn't. I can't even contact the IO because he doesn't pick up. Overall they seem extremely inefficient and unwilling to help.

265,singapore,180968,My Gym Story,cl5a06,SimbaTheSavage8,1564758246,2,0," I really want to share this just to get it off my chest, and also because I saw stuff similiar to this often in Reddit, and I'm also interested to know what you think.

&amp;#x200B;

  Back when I was in secondary school my mum was hooked on gyms and after my sister successfully lost a lot of weight in exchange for muscle, she wanted ME to go through a similiar programme to build up my 'muscle strength'. So she sent me to Gym A (I won't name names because I don't want to hurt anybody's buisness), but it all fell flat when they got into a fight about the price of membership fees, and I was withdrawn immediately despite having nothing but praise. At that point in time I was simultanoesly in another gym, Gym B, which was incredible at first. It had a small premise in Joo Chiat and consists of a waiting area, a large space with a rock wall and an office with a treadmill behind. I liked the small space a lot, and the staff is nice, and best of all, the founder bought a chess board for us to play with. Back in those days I was at the peak of my chess competetive career, and that board was a really nice way to practise and revise for competitions.

  Then they moved to a new location in Upper Changi Road, and that was when things start to go downhill.Their new location is much bigger, with the office and reception in one room, and two backlots that consist of a range of exercise equipment like monkey bars and rock walls, because the main target demographic is for children. It was a big shopping mall, but there are less than 10 buisnesses running shop. The rest are always shuttered up, and with no signs, it was a complete maze to get to the lift. Furthermore, I have a big feeling that the new building is haunted, but nobody believed me. So walking through there made me paranoid and uneasy, and I was always on guard. In fact, it scared me so much that in my 2-3 years in the new building, I almost never went to the toilet, because I was so scared,and only drank water when I needed to.

  In both Joo Chiat and this new building I always started this one-hour session by running on the treadmill for half an hour; the rest is basically normal workout routines, like planking and climbing the rock wall and crunches. I hate the treadmill, even now I don't like it, and that was always my least favourite part of the routine. I persuaded my mum, thus, to tell the people there to do more workout and less treadmill, and my mum agreed because 30 minutes running was kinda ridiculous. But I should've been more careful of what I wished for, because instead of spending more time focusing on the parts I need to improve, they made me, with those former 30 minutes from the treadmill, walk the stairs behind the premises, and I HATED IT, rather the treadmill, for these reasons:

Firstly, the stairs are so quiet you can hear yourself, and if the toilet made me uneasy, those stairs were a thousand times worse. At times there are parts which is enshrouded in darkness and some with flickering lights, and I kept thinking I would be jumpscared by an apparition, especially since there's a mysterious black door at the basement. Of course nobody would believe me when I said those stairs are haunted; they said they brought seven-year-olds there with no problem, but I doubt that kid had the same instincts I had when it comes to this sort of thing.

  They also made you walk ALL THE WAY DOWN AND BACK UP, and it was a 5-storey building, I think, plus a basement, which is so exhausting that I went through the other activities in a daze, not caring any more.Thirdly, after my first trainer returned to Australia to further her studies, I got a second one, which was equally nice, but the place was under-staffed, and the second girl was overworked, poor thing. So while she ate her dinner and rested I was taken by somebody else which I felt was unfriendly and unpleasent. I would also like to point out that these sessions were not cheap: they were a specialist session, costing like a $1000 an hour, and does walking up and down stairs for roughly half that time worth that money?

  Using these points, I successfully persuaded my mother to stop enrolling me to these classes, and when she called, point #3 came to mind, and she noted they have become a lot less friendly and have poorer customer service. I was relieved that all this is finally over, because I hate gyms. But she told me she found Gym C, said to work miracles, which I endured for about 2 or so years but not making progress because I was just going there because my mum was forcing me to and thus not putting in any effort, so that went down the drain; she signed me up at Gym D--her gym-- and I finally found peace. The staff was friendly, unlike the previous three, the trainer cared, and since it was located at Bugis Junction I get to go down to the supermarket and the basement and the resturants and frolick there after I was done, which was an added bonus. My progress was very slow, but then my trainer decided to work part-time, and give up many of her regular classes, and that was when I stopped going to gyms altogether, before I hit poly,which i'm really happy about, even till today.

Ironically, the demands of my course and career course means I can't sit down. Today for example I spent most of my time running around carrying trays and other objects, and at this rate progress through my diploma course has been faster for my physical health than all 4 gyms combined. I guess that means it does take time to show results, though looking back, I wish I paid a little more attention at the gyms to improve my physical health.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/cl5a06/my_gym_story/,0.0,"['&gt;they were a specialist session, costing like a $1000 an hour\n\nCannot relate.

One such example is recent measure to build Changi Airport Terminal 5 5.5 metres above mean sea level to deal with rising sea levels.\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; It is highly disappointing, however, that it downplays the pressing need to adopt more substantial mitigating measures that address root causes, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n&gt; A worker uses a lawn mover to cut bushes next to the financial district in Singapore on June 2, 2014. (Photo: AFP / Roslan Rahman)\n\n&gt; The commentary notes that the question of mitigation in Singapore has been far simpler and less politically fraught than in other countries, and that Singaporeans have already worked towards more climate-friendly consumption patterns.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; This obscures a few important facts about mitigation, unlike what the commentary posits, as the cost of climate change mitigation is very much “inextricably linked to political to political questions of cost, economic restructuring, decline and job losses”.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; LOOK AT INDUSTRY’S ENERGY CONSUMPTION\n\n&gt; Firstly, the source of much of Singapore’s emissions is not consumers, but industry.\n\n&gt; As Singapore’s Energy Statistics indicate, of 2016’s total final energy consumption of 14,714.6 kilotonne of oil equivalent (ktoe), over 65 per cent (9,670.3 ktoe) was consumed by industry, far dwarfing the 5 per cent (739.2 ktoe) from household consumption and less than 18 per cent (2,587.1 ktoe) from transport.\n\n&gt; Furthermore, Singapore’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution states that a reduction of 36 per cent in Emissions Intensity (EI) from 2005 levels is intended by 2030.\n\n&gt; As EI is measured by greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of GDP, this means that Singapore’s emissions could continue to rise during this period, as long as our GDP continues to grow.\n\n&gt; This contradicts the recommendations of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report on 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, a consensus of the best available scientific evidence, which makes it crystal clear that mitigation is necessary.\n\n&gt; Participants attend a panel at the COP21, United Nations Climate Change Conference, in Le Bourget, north of Paris on Dec 8, 2015. (Photo: AP/Michel Euler)\n\n&gt; According to the report, global emissions need to be cut in half by 2030 and reach net-zero in 2050 in order to stay below 1.5 degrees of warming and avoid the worst consequences of global warming to human life.\n\n&gt; Singapore, on the other hand, rather than mitigating total absolute emissions, is actively growing them.\n\n&gt; For a commentary that calls for us to be clear-eyed in our assessment, it is a shame that its argument is ultimately detached from these realities.\n\n&gt; TAKE A HARDER LOOK AT DIRTY INDUSTRIES\n\n&gt; Secondly, if we are to be serious about the climate crisis, we should not overlook the need to engage in much more substantial mitigation measures that address the root causes of carbon emissions.\n\n&gt; This includes focusing on the emissions of the dirtier industries, such as the oil and gas industry where Singapore plays host to one of the world’s largest petrochemical complexes that also contributes to the majority of emissions from industry as at 2014, according to the Government's most recent published statistics in the Biennial Update Report to the UN Framework on Climate Change Convention.\n\n&gt; This is not to say that adaptation, which is the focus of the Government’s existing efforts, is not important.\n\n&gt; In fact, mitigation and adaptation need to come hand-in-hand.\n\n&gt; As philosopher Dale Jamieson has pointed out, adaptation without mitigation is futile. This is because the less mitigation is done, the worse warming will be, and the more adaptation will be required.\n\n&gt; FILE PHOTO: Gas flares from an ExxonMobil oil refinery in Singapore, February 26, 2019. (Photo: REUTERS/Edgar Su)\n\n&gt; Reducing emissions to remain within 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming gives adaptation measures higher chances of success. Indeed, failure to mitigate might bring climate beyond tipping points, from which it might not even be possible for us to adapt.\n\n&gt; SINGAPORE IS PART OF THE PROBLEM\n\n&gt; Thirdly, while it is true that Singapore only represents a small proportion of global emissions, we should not pretend that we are not part of the problem.\n\n&gt; A study by the Carnegie Institution for Science’s Steven Davis and Ken Caldeira published in 2010 showed that Singapore ranked in the top three countries for net imported emissions per capita and consumption emissions per capita.\n\n&gt; In addition, being a small nation has not kept Singapore from tackling ambitious challenges such as social housing and smart city planning, with our successful outcomes modelled as positive policy examples by the global community.\n\n&gt; Reducing emissions at the scale and speed required could also bolster our expertise offering to other developing cities in the region and be a new opportunity to demonstrate to the world a Singaporean model of true sustainability.\n\n&gt; In order to bring about the collective understanding and meaningful action the commentary calls for, these are the facts we must first be clear-eyed about.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; The authors are volunteers with 350 Singapore, a grassroots group that aims to inspire the public, policymakers, and industry to get Singapore on track to a world within 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, through a just transition to a net-zero carbon future by 2050.\n\n&gt; \n\n---\n1.0.1 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)""]"

I first posted on [r/singapore](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore) about [my visit to Truelove.is](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bqbu8r/i_am_a_gay_exchristian_and_i_attended_a/), where I found that they are centred on a mindset that refuses to engage with criticism. Instead, they ridicule, discount and demean their critics. I have been following their recent Instagram ""fake news"" scuffle, and I noticed that [someone else has already posted about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ch80jx/instagram_account_trueloveissg_is_promoting/). I feel like it's timely for me to chime in by linking my own experience of the group to my thoughts on their current stand against criticism!

**TLDR**

1. They misuse POFMA language because POFMA doesn't cover criticism, parody or satire
2. They refuse to engage sincerely with criticism because to do so entails considering the possibility that they are wrong
3. Yes, they advocate conversion therapy!

Before moving on to the article itself, I just want to appeal to you to share [my Medium post](https://medium.com/@whatistruelove/truelove-is-has-proven-that-it-cannot-listen-beb16200d3c0) on your social media. Together, we can put a stop to homophobia in Singapore, regardless of how disguised it might be!

\---

Previously, I wrote a piece titled[ “I am a gay ex-Christian and I attended a Truelove.is event”](https://medium.com/@whatistruelove/i-am-a-gay-ex-christian-and-i-attended-a-truelove-is-event-8871aa331f97?source=post_page---------------------------), in which I documented how this movement behaves behind closed doors. Amongst other things, I found that Truelove.is operates on an ideology that refuses to engage productively with criticism, choosing instead to interpret rebuttals as attacks on their identity and not their ideology. To recap,

&gt;*Truelove.is’s wilful aversion of engaging with criticism is a return to an “out of sight, out of mind” strategy that discounts the critic as someone worth engaging; if I don’t understand you, I can’t be guilty, and I don’t have to change for you.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Why, then, are the critics not worth listening to? Truelove.is seems to think they are either liberal or stupid. Later on in the event, we are introduced to a Truelove.is social media response squad — they are “a group that \[has\] faithfully been responding on social media”, a group of “lawyers and writers who gather together and say, ‘hey, we cannot let* ***lies and fake news*** *triumph.’”*

My piece was received with much aplomb; it even gained enough traction to warrant a reply from their pastor \[FB link has been removed as per subreddit rules\]. In his response, Ian Toh mentions that Truelove.is “\[has\] reflected on \[my\] comments of shutting out criticism and will do better”. I took this to mean that Truelove.is might thus prove me wrong, that

&gt;*Instead of engaging with criticism, all opposition is deemed wrong because they are from the left side of the ideology spectrum. To Truelove.is’s online response team, it’s not about what you say, but* *who* *you are. If you are a liberal, then your thoughts are fake news \[. . .\] Truelove.is might insist that they are here for conversations and not conversions, but these are conservations they will have* *about* *you and not* *with* *you.*

Nonetheless, even though Toh promised me that his team will stop shutting out criticism, this is a goal they have yet again failed to achieve.

Recently, an Instagram post by @gabbiwenyiayane criticised Truelove.is for being “conversion therapy masquerading as allyship” and employing “psychological manipulation to ‘convert’ queer people to fit society’s cisheteronormative standards”. Her post features a photoshopped image of a Truelove.is banner with “conversation” changed to “conversion” and “A Fucking Disgrace” added below its heading.

[\[link to image\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*HZEc1RautqKWxCQX)

Ayane’s post is the latest entry to a long list of similar attacks on Truelove.is.[ Rice Media](https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-brilliant-marketing-truelove-homophobia-rebranded-chance-acceptance/?source=post_page---------------------------) has charged Truelove.is with “masking homophobia as holiness” and “claim\[ing\] to demonstrate unconditional love, yet stop\[ping\] short of all-encompassing acceptance and affirmation”.[ Gay Star News](https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/this-christian-group-that-loves-lgbti-people-may-have-ulterior-motives/?source=post_page---------------------------#gs.9chd2m) is troubled by Truelove.is’s insistence that homosexuality can be repressed and even reversed. [This Yahoo! Article](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/christian-group-truelove-hit-fresh-045622675.html?source=post_page---------------------------) summarises Truelove.is’s embattled media coverage well.

As I pointed out in my previous piece, these are critiques that Truelove.is is aware of. More importantly, these are critiques to which Toh promised better, more sincere and genuine engagement.

Yet, and perhaps expectedly so, Truelove.is responded to Ayane in the manner they knew best. Taking a leaf from Singapore’s newly minted [Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill (POFMA)](https://www.gov.sg/news/content/today-online---all-you-need-to-know-about-the-debate-on-spores-proposed-fake-news-laws?source=post_page---------------------------), Truelove.is called Ayane’s edited image a “deliberate \[effort\] to spread online falsehoods that TrueLove.is practices so-called ‘conversion therapy’”.

[\[link to image\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*H9qajGksQLlx5Ae1)

While I previously harboured hope that Truelove.is might have learned from my criticism, their latest reaction has reinforced my disappointment in them. By once again choosing to view criticism as “fake news”, Truelove.is has demonstrated a trend for ignoring its opponents by discounting and ridiculing them. It is more comfortable for Truelove.is to believe that they live in a lie-ridden world, because the alternative — that genuine, legitimate and logical arguments against them exist — is too dangerous a reality for them to inhabit.

In other words, it’s more important for Truelove.is to believe in their righteousness — and, by extension, in the sinfulness and wrongness of “The Liberals” — than it is to engage with arguments against their ideas.

**Misusing POFMA**

Truelove.is has tried to protect itself by characterising Ayane’s post as something that falls under POFMA’s jurisdiction. By calling the edited post a “deliberate \[effort\] to spread online falsehoods”, Truelove.is wants to believe that the post possesses the same sort of malicious and untrue quality that one might possess if they wish to undermine national security.

However, on a purely technical note, Truelove.is’s retaliation is on unsteady ground. After all, Ayane’s post is obviously an instance of criticism, satire and parody, none of which are prohibited by POFMA. As [The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/7-things-to-know-about-singapores-proposed-law-to-combat-online-fake-news?source=post_page---------------------------) puts it,

&gt;*A falsehood is defined as a statement of fact that is false or misleading.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*It does not cover opinions, criticisms, satire or parody, which the public can continue to upload and share.*

To most reasonable readers, Ayane’s doctored image reads obviously as criticism, parody and satire, because no organisation would call itself a “fucking disgrace”.

**A desperate desire to be correct in spite of reality**

However, Truelove.is’s problematic relationship with “fake news” goes beyond purely technical terms. Truelove’s knee-jerk reaction of deeming contradictory arguments “fake news” should unnerve us because it brings to mind authoritarian impulses that seize power over truth in order to consolidate power and control.

Hidden within this resort to “fake news” is Truelove.is’s insistence that it is correct, because to believe anything else would rupture the ego that holds them together. Since Truelove.is’s identity is rooted so deeply in its moral opposition to homosexuality, entertaining the validity of these counter-arguments is too terrifying a move to make because it draws them closer towards an inexorable point of anguish: having to consider that these alternative viewpoints might be *valid.*

This rhetoric of “fake news” is not new to the movement; they used it [during their symposium](https://medium.com/@whatistruelove/i-am-a-gay-ex-christian-and-i-attended-a-truelove-is-event-8871aa331f97?source=post_page---------------------------) to discredit opposing views as well.

&gt;*\[W\]e are introduced to a Truelove.is social media response squad — they are “a group that \[has\] faithfully been responding on social media”, a group of “lawyers and writers who gather together and say, ‘hey, we cannot let* ***lies and fake news*** *triumph.’”*

Evidently, Truelove.is’s self-image is founded on a persecution fantasy in which it is hated for its identity and not its ideology. Since, in this worldview, Truelove.is is a perfect and blameless vessel of truth, it is impossible for the “liberal and mainstream media” (a term used during their symposium) to attack them on an argumentative level. Consequently, everything the Liberals say is false by definition. As such, there is no need for engagement, only the labelling of falsehood.

Who else uses this tactic? Donald Trump and far-right extremism.

When Trump runs up against news reports that expose his misdeeds, he defends himself by making unfounded attacks on their truth value. Rarely, if ever, does Trump actually examine the evidence and arguments these reports provide. Why not? Such a reaction suggests at least three possibilities: Trump doesn’t know how to examine the data; Trump genuinely believes he is right; he knows that the only way out is to lie.

None of these possibilities cast Truelove.is in a fair light.

Firstly, we must eliminate the first possibility, because Truelove.is isn’t stupid. As they told us at the symposium, they have esteemed and learned members of society, such as lawyers and writers, on their side. Their branding is also not the product of an unintelligent mind. Clearly, they know enough about aesthetics and public relations to produce a text that can sustain the appearance of genuine hospitality.

This leads us to two remaining possibilities: Truelove.is is either convinced it’s right or consciously choosing to lie. I believe both are simultaneously true: in its desperation to believe in itself, Truelove.is is willing to believe in “alternative facts”, choosing to imagine and inhabit reality that it wishes were true instead. It chooses to ignore the substantial scientific evidence that establishes homosexuality as a natural, involuntary, and harmless variation in human psychology. It also chooses to resist the inevitable realisation that life without “same-sex attraction” is a viable mode of existence, which is a position that its predecessors, such as Exodus International, has publicly and decisively denounced [\[1\]](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/the-man-who-dismantled-the-ex-gay-ministry/408970/?source=post_page---------------------------) [\[2\]](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/20/us/exodus-international-shutdown/?source=post_page---------------------------).

Finally, and most bizarrely, Truelove.is chooses to believe in a persecution fantasy in which it is Christians, and not gay people, who are subjected to social and institutional discrimination:

&gt;*Many of these Christians with same-sex attraction feel that they have been marginalized by some members of the LGBT community and their allies because their worldview isn’t in agreement with the two established community narratives — that you’re born this way, and that you can’t change. Sadly, for the ones who have been bold enough to share their struggles, hate-filled responses to their personal stories reinforce their belief that it is not safe for them to come out to the pro-LGBT community after they’ve chosen a life of faith, in which they explore a life which confronts the established community narratives of being born this way and change not being possible.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*\[Source: FB note on their page; deleted as per subreddit rules\]*

Despite originating in a country where anal sex between consenting men is still criminalised for gross indecency, where [gay teachers are held in the closet via the silent threat of dismissal](https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-singapore-queer-teachers-have-things-changed/?source=post_page---------------------------), where [our sexuality education programmes uphold heterosexual unions at the expense of all other partnerships](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/moe-sex-ed-programme-advocate-073540994.html?source=post_page---------------------------), where [our national leaders turn a blind eye to the systemic injustices that weigh LGBT citizens down](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/377a-will-be-around-some-time-will-not-inhibit-how-spore-attracts-tech-talent-pm-lee?source=post_page---------------------------), where [LGBT citizens feel an ever-tightening lack of dignity constricting their ability to thrive](https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-lgbtq-singaporeans-give-up-or-fight-on/?source=post_page---------------------------), where [dignity is only possible upon leaving our country](https://junkasia.com/2019/03/14/first-person-girlfriend-singapore-marriage/?fbclid=IwAR3CtU9Bpo_GYMhOnh1QTkW4H3EbanU5tQwMA_IkvLtv4qmt8xCnfcuS9vg&amp;source=post_page---------------------------), Truelove.is somehow still manages to see itself, a movement wholly in line with the nation’s systemic marginalisation and erasure of queerness, as the victim.

In order to sustain its persecution fantasy, which in turn structures and reinforces its identity as a maligned bearer of righteousness, Truelove.is decides to lie to itself about how the world works.

As Trump has shown us, a rash turn to “fake news” is often the defence mechanism of a fragile ego that knows its survival is contingent upon disregarding reality. This seems to be the position Truelove.is has found itself in. Perhaps, like Trump, whose sense of self is founded on an overripe image of himself as an infallible and uniquely righteous immensity, Truelove.is knows that to seriously entertain a counter-argument is to hold a needle to its own taut skin.

**Psychological conversion therapy is still conversion therapy**

Finally, to reiterate sentiments from my previous piece and to definitively put the “we are not conversion therapy advocates!” argument to rest, let me point out that Truelove.is ultimately promotes conversion therapy because it demands, even if only of its own adherents, to repress their sexual desires in exchange for social acceptance, while holding hostage their dignity and social acceptance.

In their rebuttal against Ayane, Truelove.is has written that it is not a conversion therapy provider. Instead, it “provides Christian stories, resources and a safe community to help Christians with unwanted same-sex attraction.”

Much is hidden within the phrase *unwanted same-sex attraction*. This sense of unwantedness, that homosexuality is a burden that must be stripped from its bearer, is *programmed* into the subject through mutually reinforcing circles of social and psychological control. Here are the psychological processes involved in the Truelove.is journey:

1. **Internalised homophobia**  
Come to think of your attractions as dirty, sinful, hell-worthy; through social programming and peer influence, internalise the thought that you are exceptionally and profoundly flawed.
2. **Self-flagellation**  
Reinforce the inferiority from (1) by reminding yourself of the need to purge yourself of homosexual desires in order to escape hell; yet, these desires return, and your daily struggle between purity and damnation continues.
3. **Coming out**  
Come out to your society as one struggling with SSA; invite more people into your structure of sexual policing, so that self-flagellation is reinforced by the threat of actual social condemnation.
4. **Going back in**  
You realise that even though you pray and talk about it, your SSA never goes away; you think this reflects badly on your own piety; you entrench your social position as “that person who struggles with SSA”. Soon, you become defined both by your SSA and your *failure* to move past it. Become the subject of failure, in a repeated but never perfected act of failing. You *internalise* the judgment of your society.
5. **Life goes on around you, but not in you**  
Your straight friends move into relationships, get married, live unified lives. You remain chaste, celibate, and you feel loneliness make its home in your heart. Surely, holiness is its own reward.
6. **Learning to love the abuse**  
Tell yourself that the trauma you suffer from the above processes is a badge of honour that you happily wear in order to prove your piety; you link your socially conferred sense of self-worth to pain that is transmuted into pleasure. True love is straight love, and since that is what you can never experience, it is something you don’t deserve.

In this structure, the subject learns to love their suffering, and they learn to inflict it on themselves. One might thus say that the Truelove.is process is even more dangerous than electroshock therapy because its ultimate aim is to make the subject their own abuser.

Conversion therapy, at its core, is not about electric shocks. Electric shocks are but a means to an end. Truelove.is moves beyond this, operating instead on an even more sinister level. Its teachings might appear harmless because they don’t traumatise the body, but it they are harmful, and even *more* harmful than electric shocks, precisely because they weaponise the victim’s psyche against itself. While shocks are externally administered, shame, guilt and self-loathing are internally inflicted. Truelove.is seeks to instil within the adherent a self-reinforcing system of shame, shock and submission. Physical torture isn’t needed because the victim’s mind will learn, and love, to torture itself. *If I learn to love the pain, I am worthy. If I do not, I will go to hell.*

**Conclusion: True love is straight love**

In its desperation to exonerate itself, Truelove.is has resorted to reshaping reality in its head. By doing so, the movement has revealed that it is fundamentally founded upon the exclusion of contrary thoughts because evidence-based arguments have the potential to fracture the walls that keep them up and away from the Liberals that they despise. Hell for them is a world in which they might be proven wrong. Heaven, then, is a world in which these arguments dissolve into the ether of untruth. To reuse and update a statement I used in my previous article: “all in all, Truelove.is talks *about* gay people, speaks *at* gay people, but does not know how — and does not *want* — to talk *with* gay people”.

I first posted on r/singapore about [my visit to Truelove.is](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bqbu8r/i_am_a_gay_exchristian_and_i_attended_a/), where I found that they are centred on a mindset that refuses to engage with criticism. Instead, they ridicule, discount and demean their critics. I have been following their recent Instagram ""fake news"" scuffle, and I noticed that [someone else has already posted about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ch80jx/instagram_account_trueloveissg_is_promoting/). I feel like it's timely for me to chime in by linking my own experience of the group to my thoughts on their current stand against criticism!

**TLDR**  
1. They misuse POFMA language because POFMA doesn't cover criticism, parody or satire  
2. They refuse to engage sincerely with criticism because to do so entails considering the possibility that they are wrong  
3. Yes, they advocate conversion therapy!

Previously, I wrote a piece titled[ “I am a gay ex-Christian and I attended a Truelove.is event”](https://medium.com/@whatistruelove/i-am-a-gay-ex-christian-and-i-attended-a-truelove-is-event-8871aa331f97?source=post_page---------------------------), in which I documented how this movement behaves behind closed doors. Amongst other things, I found that Truelove.is operates on an ideology that refuses to engage productively with criticism, choosing instead to interpret rebuttals as attacks on their identity and not their ideology. To recap,

&gt;*Truelove.is’s wilful aversion of engaging with criticism is a return to an “out of sight, out of mind” strategy that discounts the critic as someone worth engaging; if I don’t understand you, I can’t be guilty, and I don’t have to change for you.*  
*Why, then, are the critics not worth listening to? Truelove.is seems to think they are either liberal or stupid. Later on in the event, we are introduced to a Truelove.is social media response squad — they are “a group that \[has\] faithfully been responding on social media”, a group of “lawyers and writers who gather together and say, ‘hey, we cannot let* ***lies and fake news*** *triumph.’”*

My piece was received with much aplomb; it even gained enough traction to warrant[ a reply from their pastor](https://www.facebook.com/notes/ian-toh/what-trueloveis-and-is-not/10156642543503096/?source=post_page---------------------------). In his response, Ian Toh mentions that Truelove.is “\[has\] reflected on \[my\] comments of shutting out criticism and will do better”. I took this to mean that Truelove.is might thus prove me wrong, that

&gt;*Instead of engaging with criticism, all opposition is deemed wrong because they are from the left side of the ideology spectrum. To Truelove.is’s online response team, it’s not about what you say, but* *who* *you are. If you are a liberal, then your thoughts are fake news \[. . .\] Truelove.is might insist that they are here for conversations and not conversions, but these are conservations they will have* *about* *you and not* *with* *you.*

Nonetheless, even though Toh promised me that his team will stop shutting out criticism, this is a goal they have yet again failed to achieve.

Recently,[ an Instagram post by @gabbiwenyiayane](https://www.instagram.com/p/B0Q49iwFiqH/?source=post_page---------------------------) criticised Truelove.is for being “conversion therapy masquerading as allyship” and employing “psychological manipulation to ‘convert’ queer people to fit society’s cisheteronormative standards”. Her post features a photoshopped image of a Truelove.is banner with “conversation” changed to “conversion” and “A Fucking Disgrace” added below its heading.

[\[link to image\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*HZEc1RautqKWxCQX)

Ayane’s post is the latest entry to a long list of similar attacks on Truelove.is.[ Rice Media](https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-brilliant-marketing-truelove-homophobia-rebranded-chance-acceptance/?source=post_page---------------------------) has charged Truelove.is with “masking homophobia as holiness” and “claim\[ing\] to demonstrate unconditional love, yet stop\[ping\] short of all-encompassing acceptance and affirmation”.[ Gay Star News](https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/this-christian-group-that-loves-lgbti-people-may-have-ulterior-motives/?source=post_page---------------------------#gs.9chd2m) is troubled by Truelove.is’s insistence that homosexuality can be repressed and even reversed. [This Yahoo! Article](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/christian-group-truelove-hit-fresh-045622675.html?source=post_page---------------------------)summarises Truelove.is’s embattled media coverage well.

As I pointed out in my previous piece, these are critiques that Truelove.is is aware of. More importantly, these are critiques to which Toh promised better, more sincere and genuine engagement.

Yet, and perhaps expectedly so, Truelove.is responded to Ayane in the manner they knew best. Taking a leaf from Singapore’s newly minted[Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill (POFMA)](https://www.gov.sg/news/content/today-online---all-you-need-to-know-about-the-debate-on-spores-proposed-fake-news-laws?source=post_page---------------------------), Truelove.is called Ayane’s edited image a “deliberate \[effort\] to spread online falsehoods that TrueLove.is practices so-called ‘conversion therapy’”.

[\[link to image\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*H9qajGksQLlx5Ae1)

While I previously harboured hope that Truelove.is might have learned from my criticism, their latest reaction has reinforced my disappointment in them. By once again choosing to view criticism as “fake news”, Truelove.is has demonstrated a trend for ignoring its opponents by discounting and ridiculing them. It is more comfortable for Truelove.is to believe that they live in a lie-ridden world, because the alternative — that genuine, legitimate and logical arguments against them exist — is too dangerous a reality for them to inhabit.

In other words, it’s more important for Truelove.is to believe in their righteousness — and, by extension, in the sinfulness and wrongness of “The Liberals” — than it is to engage with arguments against their ideas.

**Misusing POFMA**

Truelove.is has tried to protect itself by characterising Ayane’s post as something that falls under POFMA’s jurisdiction. By calling the edited post a “deliberate \[effort\] to spread online falsehoods”, Truelove.is wants to believe that the post possesses the same sort of malicious and untrue quality that one might possess if they wish to undermine national security.

However, on a purely technical note, Truelove.is’s retaliation is on unsteady ground. After all, Ayane’s post is obviously an instance of criticism, satire and parody, none of which are prohibited by POFMA. As[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/7-things-to-know-about-singapores-proposed-law-to-combat-online-fake-news?source=post_page---------------------------) puts it,

&gt;*A falsehood is defined as a statement of fact that is false or misleading.*  
*It does not cover opinions, criticisms, satire or parody, which the public can continue to upload and share.*

To most reasonable readers, Ayane’s doctored image reads obviously as criticism, parody and satire, because no organisation would call itself a “fucking disgrace”.

**A desperate desire to be correct in spite of reality**

However, Truelove.is’s problematic relationship with “fake news” goes beyond purely technical terms. Truelove’s knee-jerk reaction of deeming contradictory arguments “fake news” should unnerve us because it brings to mind authoritarian impulses that seize power over truth in order to consolidate power and control.

Hidden within this resort to “fake news” is Truelove.is’s insistence that it is correct, because to believe anything else would rupture the ego that holds them together. Since Truelove.is’s identity is rooted so deeply in its moral opposition to homosexuality, entertaining the validity of these counter-arguments is too terrifying a move to make because it draws them closer towards an inexorable point of anguish: having to consider that these alternative viewpoints might be *valid.*

This rhetoric of “fake news” is not new to the movement; they used it[during their symposium](https://medium.com/@whatistruelove/i-am-a-gay-ex-christian-and-i-attended-a-truelove-is-event-8871aa331f97?source=post_page---------------------------) to discredit opposing views as well.

&gt;*\[W\]e are introduced to a Truelove.is social media response squad — they are “a group that \[has\] faithfully been responding on social media”, a group of “lawyers and writers who gather together and say, ‘hey, we cannot let* ***lies and fake news*** *triumph.’”*

Evidently, Truelove.is’s self-image is founded on a persecution fantasy in which it is hated for its identity and not its ideology. Since, in this worldview, Truelove.is is a perfect and blameless vessel of truth, it is impossible for the “liberal and mainstream media” (a term used during their symposium) to attack them on an argumentative level. Consequently, everything the Liberals say is false by definition. As such, there is no need for engagement, only the labelling of falsehood.

Who else uses this tactic? Donald Trump and far-right extremism.

When Trump runs up against news reports that expose his misdeeds, he defends himself by making unfounded attacks on their truth value. Rarely, if ever, does Trump actually examine the evidence and arguments these reports provide. Why not? Such a reaction suggests at least three possibilities: Trump doesn’t know how to examine the data; Trump genuinely believes he is right; he knows that the only way out is to lie.

None of these possibilities cast Truelove.is in a fair light.

Firstly, we must eliminate the first possibility, because Truelove.is isn’t stupid. As they told us at the symposium, they have esteemed and learned members of society, such as lawyers and writers, on their side. Their branding is also not the product of an unintelligent mind. Clearly, they know enough about aesthetics and public relations to produce a text that can sustain the appearance of genuine hospitality.

This leads us to two remaining possibilities: Truelove.is is either convinced it’s right or consciously choosing to lie. I believe both are simultaneously true: in its desperation to believe in itself, Truelove.is is willing to believe in “alternative facts”, choosing to imagine and inhabit reality that it wishes were true instead. It chooses to ignore the substantial scientific evidence that establishes homosexuality as a natural, involuntary, and harmless variation in human psychology. It also chooses to resist the inevitable realisation that life without “same-sex attraction” is a viable mode of existence, which is a position that its predecessors, such as Exodus International, has publicly and decisively denounced [\[1\]](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/the-man-who-dismantled-the-ex-gay-ministry/408970/?source=post_page---------------------------) [\[2\]](https://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/20/us/exodus-international-shutdown/?source=post_page---------------------------).

Finally, and most bizarrely, Truelove.is chooses to believe in a persecution fantasy in which it is Christians, and not gay people, who are subjected to social and institutional discrimination:

&gt;*Many of these Christians with same-sex attraction feel that they have been marginalized by some members of the LGBT community and their allies because their worldview isn’t in agreement with the two established community narratives — that you’re born this way, and that you can’t change. Sadly, for the ones who have been bold enough to share their struggles, hate-filled responses to their personal stories reinforce their belief that it is not safe for them to come out to the pro-LGBT community after they’ve chosen a life of faith, in which they explore a life which confronts the established community narratives of being born this way and change not being possible.* [*\[Source\]*](https://www.facebook.com/notes/ian-toh/what-trueloveis-and-is-not/10156642543503096/?fref=mentions&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDoopWfx1upHjZsGKux4pofTAGM7MWh3KUY0d8E5tkTHkczE-Zr64BzuK0phYmfdgRZzk0YMWa09pNZ7RYrLFNL8MH5eAHZLuHrnUFK-DQfPcqxe89sEDnXRYLdxOexgy4Y-el2eOHQBF46vFDixIt4dHZTQWU1KDVSzT-Ca3bznWlMnN1mZEMYpkR-z6-jDxmWjbsVKgIPr0sWKn0c9z6VydMYZ78-QFMjcjbN96hQrCCdKdDi2eaLylb2RyD-OV4oeiR7mwCvHupSDq2qMrns2ZjbARP6MpxpWjseXt-KSpeS48LFAOUPWxD5waexXM-W-8opa6ELitA2hTYcaZ0&amp;__tn__=K-R&amp;source=post_page---------------------------)

Despite originating in a country where anal sex between consenting men is still criminalised for gross indecency, where [gay teachers are held in the closet via the silent threat of dismissal](https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-singapore-queer-teachers-have-things-changed/?source=post_page---------------------------), where [our sexuality education programmes uphold heterosexual unions at the expense of all other partnerships](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/moe-sex-ed-programme-advocate-073540994.html?source=post_page---------------------------), where [our national leaders turn a blind eye to the systemic injustices that weigh LGBT citizens down](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/377a-will-be-around-some-time-will-not-inhibit-how-spore-attracts-tech-talent-pm-lee?source=post_page---------------------------), where [LGBT citizens feel an ever-tightening lack of dignity constricting their ability to thrive](https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-lgbtq-singaporeans-give-up-or-fight-on/?source=post_page---------------------------), where [dignity is only possible upon leaving our country](https://junkasia.com/2019/03/14/first-person-girlfriend-singapore-marriage/?fbclid=IwAR3CtU9Bpo_GYMhOnh1QTkW4H3EbanU5tQwMA_IkvLtv4qmt8xCnfcuS9vg&amp;source=post_page---------------------------), Truelove.is somehow still manages to see itself, a movement wholly in line with the nation’s systemic marginalisation and erasure of queerness, as the victim.

In order to sustain its persecution fantasy, which in turn structures and reinforces its identity as a maligned bearer of righteousness, Truelove.is decides to lie to itself about how the world works.

As Trump has shown us, a rash turn to “fake news” is often the defence mechanism of a fragile ego that knows its survival is contingent upon disregarding reality. This seems to be the position Truelove.is has found itself in. Perhaps, like Trump, whose sense of self is founded on an overripe image of himself as an infallible and uniquely righteous immensity, Truelove.is knows that to seriously entertain a counter-argument is to hold a needle to its own taut skin.

**Psychological conversion therapy is still conversion therapy**

Finally, to reiterate sentiments from my previous piece and to definitively put the “we are not conversion therapy advocates!” argument to rest, let me point out that Truelove.is ultimately promotes conversion therapy because it demands, even if only of its own adherents, to repress their sexual desires in exchange for social acceptance, while holding hostage their dignity and social acceptance.

In their rebuttal against Ayane, Truelove.is has written that it is not a conversion therapy provider. Instead, it “provides Christian stories, resources and a safe community to help Christians with unwanted same-sex attraction.”

Much is hidden within the phrase *unwanted same-sex attraction*. This sense of unwantedness, that homosexuality is a burden that must be stripped from its bearer, is *programmed* into the subject through mutually reinforcing circles of social and psychological control. Here are the psychological processes involved in the Truelove.is journey:

1. **Internalised homophobia**  
Come to think of your attractions as dirty, sinful, hell-worthy; through social programming and peer influence, internalise the thought that you are exceptionally and profoundly flawed.
2. **Self-flagellation**  
Reinforce the inferiority from (1) by reminding yourself of the need to purge yourself of homosexual desires in order to escape hell; yet, these desires return, and your daily struggle between purity and damnation continues.
3. **Coming out**  
Come out to your society as one struggling with SSA; invite more people into your structure of sexual policing, so that self-flagellation is reinforced by the threat of actual social condemnation.
4. **Going back in**  
You realise that even though you pray and talk about it, your SSA never goes away; you think this reflects badly on your own piety; you entrench your social position as “that person who struggles with SSA”. Soon, you become defined both by your SSA and your *failure* to move past it. Become the subject of failure, in a repeated but never perfected act of failing. You *internalise* the judgment of your society.
5. **Life goes on around you, but not in you**  
Your straight friends move into relationships, get married, live unified lives. You remain chaste, celibate, and you feel loneliness make its home in your heart. Surely, holiness is its own reward.
6. **Learning to love the abuse**  
Tell yourself that the trauma you suffer from the above processes is a badge of honour that you happily wear in order to prove your piety; you link your socially conferred sense of self-worth to pain that is transmuted into pleasure. True love is straight love, and since that is what you can never experience, it is something you don’t deserve.

In this structure, the subject learns to love their suffering, and they learn to inflict it on themselves. One might thus say that the Truelove.is process is even more dangerous than electroshock therapy because its ultimate aim is to make the subject their own abuser.

Conversion therapy, at its core, is not about electric shocks. Electric shocks are but a means to an end. Truelove.is moves beyond this, operating instead on an even more sinister level. Its teachings might appear harmless because they don’t traumatise the body, but it they are harmful, and even *more* harmful than electric shocks, precisely because they weaponise the victim’s psyche against itself. While shocks are externally administered, shame, guilt and self-loathing are internally inflicted. Truelove.is seeks to instil within the adherent a self-reinforcing system of shame, shock and submission. Physical torture isn’t needed because the victim’s mind will learn, and love, to torture itself. *If I learn to love the pain, I am worthy. If I do not, I will go to hell.*

**Conclusion: True love is straight love**

In its desperation to exonerate itself, Truelove.is has resorted to reshaping reality in its head. By doing so, the movement has revealed that it is fundamentally founded upon the exclusion of contrary thoughts because evidence-based arguments have the potential to fracture the walls that keep them up and away from the Liberals that they despise. Hell for them is a world in which they might be proven wrong. Heaven, then, is a world in which these arguments dissolve into the ether of untruth. To reuse and update a statement I used in my previous article: “all in all, Truelove.is talks *about* gay people, speaks *at* gay people, but does not know how — and does not *want* — to talk *with* gay people”.

270,singapore,179225,Questions about wildlife in Singapore; Part 37: Snakeheads,cgkoj4,kodomodragon,1563837621,25,83,"Hi r/singapore, I haven't covered any fishes so far, so this week I'll be discussing a group that is found in various freshwater habitats, the [snakeheads](https://flic.kr/p/Y3rqrQ). 

Snakeheads are generally recognised by their elongated, torpedo-shaped bodies. They have large scales on the head, giving them some resemblance to snakes (hence the name 'snakehead'). The eyes are located close to the front of the head. The mouth is large as well. The dorsal fin is long, and stretches from just behind the gill covers, all the way to the base of the tail. 

Snakeheads are ambush predators, and depending on the species, either hide among aquatic vegetation, or slowly patrol the water, lunging with amazing speed once prey is detected. They feed on all sorts of smaller creatures, such as insects, crustaceans, fishes, and amphibians. Larger species can easily take birds and rats. Prey that is too large to be swallowed whole may simply be bitten in half – a snakehead's mouth is [full of sharp teeth](https://youtu.be/NTJXDO1WStE?t=02m15s), and by biting down and shaking the head vigorously, a snakehead will easily rip off large chunks of flesh.

Many snakehead species are able to live in stagnant pools and swamps with low dissolved oxygen, as they can breathe atmospheric air. In addition to gills, a snakehead possesses a secondary breathing organ that functions like a primitive lung, which is why it must periodically head to the surface to take a gulp of air. In fact, snakeheads are among those fishes that will actually drown if they are unable to surface.

This 'lung', properly called the suprabranchial chamber, also allows the snakehead to survive for some time if it is out of the water. Some species are able to travel overland by wriggling on the ground – a useful adaptation if you live in shallow pools and swamps that are at risk of drying out.

Unlike many other fishes, snakeheads exhibit parental care. Some species build nests out of aquatic vegetation, then guard the eggs, while others are mouthbrooders, with the male protecting the eggs and fry in his mouth. After the eggs hatch, one or both parents may continue to guard the fry for some time, [chasing away potential predators](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/04/sbr2016-154-155.pdf).
 
Many species of snakeheads are important food fish, and among the Chinese, it is said that snakehead flesh has medicinal value and healing properties, and is recommended for people recovering after surgery. Snakehead is typically known as 生鱼 (shēng yú ) (Mandarin), *sang yu* (Cantonese), or *loi her* (Hokkien).

Some of the larger species of snakeheads are also very popular with anglers, as they fight hard when hooked. One method that anglers use to catch snakeheads is to look out for a breeding pair guarding a brood of young fry. The fry will rise to the surface for air, creating lots of tiny ripples, while the parents will be cruising nearby. Casting a lure into the school of baby snakeheads will trigger a defensive response from one of the parents, which will attempt to drive away the intruder, only to be hooked and reeled in.

Snakeheads are [popular in the aquarium trade](https://youtu.be/WH-QqW5skmk); some aquarists are simply drawn to predators, and as a bonus, some snakehead species have very attractive patterns and coloration.

The snakehead family is distributed across Asia (46 species, with more still being described), as well as West and Central Africa (three species). Most of the Asian species live in tropical South and Southeast Asia, although there are some in temperate East Asia and northern India that prefer cooler temperatures. Five species have been recorded from Singapore:

**Common Snakehead / Aruan (*Channa striata*)**

The most widespread and common species in Singapore is the [Common Snakehead](https://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/fishes/common-snakehead.htm), locally known as *aruan* (*haruan* in Malaysia). This is a large species that grows up to 60 centimetres in length, although there are some reports of individuals reaching 90 centimetres. Other less commonly used names include Chevron Snakehead and Striped Snakehead.

It is a highly adaptable species that prefers open areas rather than forests, and is widely distributed across Singapore; it thrives in reservoirs, ponds, rivers, canals, streams, and swamps. Besides being able to travel between waterbodies by [moving on land](https://youtu.be/WwgjW3AIJa4), the Common Snakehead is able to survive dry spells by burrowing into the mud and going dormant, waiting for the rains to return. Because of this ability to survive out of water for some time, you will often see live snakeheads in buckets, trays, or baskets without any water in markets elsewhere in Southeast Asia.

Some of the places where I've often seen Common Snakeheads include the freshwater ponds in Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, the lakes in the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the streams in Windsor Nature Park, and the stretch of Kallang River flowing through Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. This is one of the few native fish species that has managed to adapt to our urban canals and waterbodies, environments that most native fishes shun.

The Common Snakehead is popular with anglers, and is also an important food fish throughout Southeast Asia, although its prominence in Singapore has been supplanted by the next species.

**Giant Snakehead / Toman (*Channa micropeltes*)**

The largest (and most famous) of our snakeheads isn't a native at all. The [Giant Snakehead](https://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/fishes/giant-snakehead.htm), also called *toman*, is found in large rivers and lakes throughout Southeast Asia, from Thailand and Indochina to Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo, and Java. However, it is considered introduced in Singapore, as the first records came from the Botanic Gardens in 1960. Over the years, it has established populations in our reservoirs, rivers, and many ponds, thanks to being released by people for various reasons.

Not only is it a food fish (if you love sliced fish bee hoon or san lao hor fun, chances are that the fish you’re eating is Giant Snakehead), [it is very popular with anglers](https://youtu.be/NTJXDO1WStE).

When young, Giant Snakeheads have prominent stripes and are reddish. However, young Giant Snakeheads in the aquarium shops are mostly sold as live feeders for other predatory fishes. Aperson who buys a baby Giant Snakehead and tries to keep it as a pet will eventually end up with a monster that can [grow to a metre in length](http://www.megafishingthailand.com/2011/10/08/giant-snakehead-chado-%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B0%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%94-vs-toman/) that requires a tank way larger than most people can provide, eats its tankmates (sometimes killing them even if it’s not hungry), and will not hesitate to take a bite out of your hand if it feels like it. Many of these unwanted pets end up getting dumped into the nearest pond or reservoir. 

It has also been said that Giant Snakeheads were introduced to our reservoirs in an attempt to serve as predators of Mozambique Tilapia, another introduced fish that thrives in these water bodies. Unfortunately, there are concerns that Giant Snakeheads can pose a safety hazard – like their smaller cousins, they are highly [protective of their young](https://youtu.be/2rcLnws53NI), and a person who ends up in the water close to a school of fry risks getting attacked by the parents. Given the Giant Snakehead’s large size, a bite can do a lot of damage.

The other three species of snakeheads found in Singapore are restricted to streams and swamps in forests, mostly within the Central Catchment Nature Reserve.

**Forest Snakehead  (*Channa lucius*)**

The [Forest Snakehead](https://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/fishes/forest-snakehead.htm) grows up to 40 centimetres in length. It is present in the Nee Soon Swamp Forest, as well as forest streams around Upper Seletar, MacRitchie, and Lower Peirce Reservoirs, and within Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.

**Black Snakehead  (*Channa melasoma*)**

The [Black Snakehead](https://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/fishes/black-snakehead.htm) reaches 30 centimetres in length, and is found in the Nee Soon Swamp Forest, as well as forest streams in the Lower Peirce area. This species has also been recorded [from Bukit Timah Nature Reserve](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/04/sbr2014-273.pdf). [It was first recorded in Singapore in 1990](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/06/38rbz021-024.pdf), but had actually been collected earlier; a specimen from Sungei Seletar in 1963 that was identified back then as a Common Snakehead turned out to be a Black Snakehead instead.

**Dwarf Snakehead (*Channa gachua*) **

The final species of snakehead found here, the [Dwarf Snakehead](https://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/fishes/dwarf-snakehead.htm)  grows to a mere 20 centimetres in length.

First collected in Singapore from Kranji in 1868, it was subsequently recorded from Bukit Timah and Mandai in the early 20th century. Today, one important stronghold for this species is [the Nee Soon Swamp Forest](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/06/37rbz172-174.pdf), where a population was discovered in 1989. It has also been recorded from streams and freshwater swamps in the Chestnut area, in the vicinity of Upper Peirce Reservoir, and is also supposedly present in similar habitats on Pulau Tekong. Although it was said to be present in streams at the base of Bukit Timah, it is not known if it still persists there; there have not been any confirmed records since the 1970s.

Currently there are 24\xa0preschools, with the number set to grow to 43 by 2022.\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, faith-based preschools are fighting to stay in existence. Earlier this year, St James\' Church Kindergarten adopted seven preschools to help keep them running.\n\n&gt; One parent petitioning for St Andrew’s Cathedral Child Development Centre in Jurong West to remain open, a 36-year-old engineer who wanted to be known only as Mr Tan, said there are now fewer centres focusing on transmitting good values, and where teachers lead by example.\n\n&gt; What do the not-for-profit kindergartens have to offer that sets them apart? Parents cite the intangibles: A strong emphasis on the child’s character and emotional development, and a certain “kampung spirit” that is evident in how principals and teachers know every child by name.\n\n&gt; NO PRIORITY ADMISSION\xa0TO PRIMARY SCHOOLS A MAJOR DRAWBACK\n\n&gt; Zion Kindergarten in Serangoon, for one, is said to have built a reputation in these aspects since it was established more than 60 years ago, in 1956. The then-bustling Christian kindergarten even sparked the creation of Zion Serangoon Bible-Presbyterian Church, which now supports it.\n\n&gt; But its principal Hannah Ong said one major drawback is that unlike MOE kindergartens, it does not offer priority admission to a primary school.\n\n&gt; And while the privately-run institution has\xa0tried to keep rates low at S$1,200 per 10-week term for three-hour sessions, the MOE kindergartens are charging S$160 per month for Singaporeans, and there are further subsidies.\n\n&gt; ""Right now we\'re really trying our best to keep our kindergarten going,"" Ms Ong said.\n\n&gt; ""Even for teachers, it took everyone a while to really have reality sink in. The teachers are worried because they will not find another place like this... It\'s really like a second family to everybody.""\n\n&gt; Also, as the MOE aims to oversee two thirds of the preschool sector by 2023, small private operators like Zion are left with a small slice of the pie as they contend with large commercial operators and international preschools.\n\n&gt; The result is a “six-figure” operating loss projected for the next school year in 2020, which would have to be absorbed by the church, said Mr Wendell Chua, an elder at Zion Serangoon Bible-Presbyterian Church.\n\n&gt; More than 40 of its students will be graduating this year, but the school has received fewer than 10 new sign-ups for its pre-nursery class.\n\n&gt; ‘EASY TO CLOSE A GOOD SCHOOL, BUT NOT EASY TO OPEN ONE’\n\n&gt; A town hall meeting involving parents was called in May to announce its closure by year end, but strong parental reaction had moved the management to give its enrolment drive another push. It currently needs at least 25 new students by September to carry on.\n\n&gt; To achieve that, close to 20 parents have banded together to brainstorm marketing ideas and come up with promotional flyers, design posters and social media campaigns.\n\n&gt; On July 27, the school will also host a carnival cum open house, where parents will organise booths, and be the event’s greeters and ushers.\n\n&gt; Ms Ong Kai Ling, 38, whose three-year-old son attends Zion Kindergarten, said she is getting involved as “it is easy to close a good\xa0school, but not easy to open one”.\n\n&gt; Ms Kerri Tan, a 38-year-old mother of two, is also spearheading efforts although her K2 child who goes to Zion Kindergarten will not be affected by its closure.\n\n&gt; “They have a wonderful set of teachers and principals who work for the children,” she said.\n\n&gt; “They have so much love for the children you don’t see anywhere else. If you visit the school in the mornings, you can see the kids running in to hug their teachers.”\n\n&gt; Although she is a free thinker, she felt the Bible education the school incorporates into its curriculum is good for her children as it teaches them “to love, be patient, and care”. Children learn these attributes by living examples — their teachers — she added.\n\n&gt; A similar effort at St Andrew’s Cathedral Child Development Centre saw more than 30 — about half — of the centre’s parents petitioning for a change of mind, and drafting a proposal working out how it could continue to exist.\n\n&gt; THE ROCKY PATH AHEAD\n\n&gt; An option for Zion Kindergarten was to convert into a childcare centre, which would make it possible for parents to tap into government subsidies, such as the basic subsidy of S$300 for working mothers opting for full-day childcare programmes.\n\n&gt; But Mr Chua said a childcare operation would require more space per child, and that would mean Zion would have to reduce its maximum capacity from 120 to 70.\n\n&gt; Taking in 50 fewer children may not be a solution in helping the school break even either, he pointed out.\n\n&gt; While an uphill task lies ahead, Zion will take the opportunity to “sharpen its saws” as it is “forced to be creative”, Mr Chua said.\n\n&gt; “We are experiencing the ripple effect of the government changing the landscape, but like all things, we try to look at the positives and we do see many opportunities to stand out even in the midst of very big operators,” he added. “We can still differentiate ourselves.”\n\n&gt; \n\n---\n1.0.1 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"
274,singapore,177816,Employer's perspective [Singaporeans glorify overworking],cczgxz,supermiggiemon,1563082410,50,0,"Referring to this other reddit thread - [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ccn8wh/do\_singaporeans\_glorify\_overworking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ccn8wh/do_singaporeans_glorify_overworking/) 

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering from the employer's perspective, if theres anything miscommunicated or misinterpreted? 

I am an employer myself from a small software company. I do not condone the concept of ""overworking"", let alone glorifying it. But I think that the situation could have been better managed by both employers and employees as a team.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sense of ownership**

OT-ing is inevitable in some cases, especially in the media/software production line. Good things require time to produce. Instead of avoiding OT-ing, maybe it can be better addressed. For example, encourage a sense of ownership so that the **team** knows (not feels, knows) that they are putting in extra hours to improve the product. This should be properly recognised, and if the company is rich enough, rewarded with bonuses. From the management standpoint, treat them well for OT-ing (whether it is reimbursing taxi fare, or buying them dinner).

&amp;#x200B;

It is not about OT-ing for a job, but rather, if you like your job, what is wrong with spending more time doing what you like? It isn't about chasing the next paycheck, but being fortunate enough to be allowed to do what you love to do. If you do not love your job, communicate with your management. If both parties cannot resolve the issue, then it is time to move on. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Sense of belonging**

There are times where some of the members stay back to help up the other guys who are lagging behind. It can be objectively to help with their tasks, or just for moral support. It should be encouraged that staying back should be to contribute (either to the team, or to gain experience how to fire fight during crunch period).

Again, this sense of belonging should be celebrated. As the employer, don't just brush it off and say, "" well, thats your job."" Rather, drop a whatsapp message to thank them for being supportive. 

If possible, stay back with the guys. To see you working as hard as them is a huge morale boost

&amp;#x200B;

**""Passion""**

There is a difference between,""loving what you do"", and ""loving the outcome from what you do"". This is very often being misinterpreted. Does a developer enjoy the act of coding? Or does a developer enjoy solving problems and creating cool stuff with their code? 

As employers, it is important that you reinforce that the team plays a huge role in determining success. Frame it properly for them if you see that they are unable to do so. 

One line which I use frequently is,"" when you are back home and your partner/ partner asks you about your day, what will you tell them? That you are unappreciated, fail to see how you are important? Or will you prefer to tell them not to worry about you working hard because what you do is fulfilling?""

&amp;#x200B;

**Identifying people who are willing to go the extra mile**

During the interview, candidates like to throw in stuff like, "" I am a team player"", ""I am willing to go the extra mile"", ""I embrace challenges"", "" I am passionate"". 

You wouldn't say these if you did not believe that these will give a better impression. So why complain when your job is extremely challenging, demands you to go the extra miles, take 1 for the team?

After a few years of interviewing candidates, I kinda ignore these fluff. Instead, observe those in the team. Of course, the guys are more than entitled to leave as soon as they are done with their own tasks. But it takes a special breed of members who will stay behind and actively help others after they are done with their job. Recognise these individuals, and reward them accordingly. It can be moving them to a different role so that they are able to influence more people, or find opportunities to share with the rest how this member has contributed. 

\--

&amp;#x200B;

Interested to hear from others. Either I am extremely fortunate, naive or there is something many redditors from the other thread isn't recognising/working out properly.

My previous employers left when their tasks were done, did not thank us for putting in extra efforts, did not bother to reimburse or reward extra efforts.\n\nI see what you mean, and if executed well you have a workforce willing to go above and beyond. But the way it has been put into place makes it a race to to bottom based on cost per unit worked.\n\nThat being said, please continue believing in your ideals because employers have to start somewhere.']"

277,singapore,176885,Questions about wildlife in Singapore; Part 35: Shrews,cajlal,kodomodragon,1562583507,12,67,"Hi r/singapore, this week I'd like to cover another group of  small mammals that are often mistaken for rodents: the [shrews](https://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/mammals/shrews.htm).

[Shrews](https://flic.kr/p/gUwVyL) (Soricidae) belong to the group Eulipotyphla, and count hedgehogs (Erinaceidae), moles (Talpidae), and solenodons (Solenodontidae) (two species of shrew-like mammals only found on islands in the Caribbean) as their closest living relatives. Older classification systems used 'Insectivora' to refer to this group, but this name is no longer favoured because it once included not just these four families, but also several other families of small mammals that aren't that closely related.

Their [eyes are tiny](https://flic.kr/p/gUxMnT) and they have very poor eyesight, so they rely very heavily on their whiskers, hearing and sense of smell. Most shrews are terrestrial and forage in the undergrowth and leaf litter, although there are also arboreal, semi-aquatic, and fossorial (burrowing) species. 

One thing that shrews is famous for is their small size; at a mere 15 centimetres in total body length (tip of snout to tip of tail) and weighing 100 grams on average, the [Asian House Shrew](https://flic.kr/p/26Z3n4s) is the world's largest shrew species. On the other hand, the [Etruscan Shrew](https://www.biolib.cz/en/taxonimage/id323819/?taxonid=20531), which has a total body length of up to eight centimetres or so, and weighs 1.8 grams on average, is considered one of the world's smallest mammals. 

Small mammals generally have high metabolic rates, but shrews take it to the extreme; some of the smaller species have heart rates that can exceed 1000 beats per minute. Shrews burn so much energy even while at rest that they need to eat all the time just to stay alive. Some studies of shrews in captive conditions show that they spend an hour foraging, eating as much as they can until they are truly full, sleeping for about an hour, then resume their search for food. A shrew that can't find any food will die of starvation *in hours*. Some species have been recorded eating two or even three times their body weight *every day*. The shrew species that have been studied in captivity have a lifespan of one to two years. Shrews are [territorial](https://youtu.be/aFBp-iNTwBc), and are said to be mostly solitary, but some might have more complex social lives than we assume, and there are a few that appear to tolerate one another and are capable of living in small groups.

As the old name for their order suggests, shrews feed heavily on insects and other invertebrates, although seeds and nuts may also be eaten. Due to their [voracious appetites](https://youtu.be/Ktt0KzuJrvE), shrews are often seen as beneficial, as they can serve as biological pest control. Some have been recorded preying on other vertebrates, such as frogs, lizards, and even mice and small snakes. Cannibalism has been recorded in some species, although these are more likely incidents of a shrew scavenging on the carcass of an already deceased conspecific. Several species subdue their prey [using venom](https://pubsapp.acs.org/cen/critter/8242shrews.html); the venom paralyses prey items but does not necessarily kill them, which allows the shrew to create food caches that can be consumed later when it is hungry again. Captive shrews have been observed to readily consume items such as meat, pet food, rolled oats, cooked rice, boiled eggs, potatoes, bread, cakes, pastries, cheese, biscuits, fruits, nuts, and peanut butter.

In shrews, the female raises the young by herself. For many species, the babies stick close to their mother by [forming a chain](https://youtu.be/AI4xu1rOpLc) - one of the youngsters uses its mouth to grip its mother's rump, another baby holds on to the sibling in front, and so on. It's often described as a [conga line](https://youtu.be/VbUQDYU8Tt4). Unfortunately, this fascinating (and adorable) behaviour has been [misinterpreted](https://www.inverse.com/article/52493-do-rats-pretend-to-be-a-snake-what-the-heck), with the shrews [misidentified](https://www.livescience.com/59962-caravan-of-shrews.html) as mice.

In Singapore, we have two species of shrews.

**Asian House Shrew (*Suncus murinus*)**

[This species](https://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/mammals/house-shrew.htm), also sometimes known as the Indian Musk Shrew, is native to the Indian subcontinent, but has been introduced to many parts of tropical and subtropical Asia, eastern Africa, the Middle East, and some island groups in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is a commensal species that lives not just in forests and rural areas, but is also able to thrive in urban environments. In Singapore, the easiest way to spot shrews is to walk around your neighbourhood or the nearby urban park; while they may be [seen during the day](https://youtu.be/06qB0Md2XJ4) , they're a lot more active at night. Shrews are usually seen [foraging in the grass](https://youtu.be/MTVBYk4C5hg), or might even be seen making short dashes across the pavement as they scurry around in search of food. One of the more memorable encounters I've heard of involves a pair seen [fighting in a market at Toa Payoh](https://mothership.sg/2019/04/shrews-fight-toa-payoh-market/).

Asian House Shrews might be [mistaken for rats or mice](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/rats-rodent-investigation-at-springside-park-uncovers-shrews-instead), but [can be differentiated](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/shrews-uncovered-at-springside-park-differences-with-rats-and-mice) by several features, such as the pointed snout, tiny eyes, small ears, and a short tail, quite unlike the long, naked-looking tail of a rat.

Because of their mostly carnivorous habits, Asian House Shrews may play a role in controlling pests like cockroaches and even rats. However, they might still be seen as a nuisance in and around buildings, since areas where they regularly travel will be marked with droppings and often have a strong musky smell, and they will consume leftovers or any food left unattended.

Interestingly, the Asian House Shrew is colloquially known as ""钱鼠"" ('money mouse') in Chinese, as the chittering noises it makes apparently resemble the clinking of coins, which has led some people to believe that finding a shrew in your home is a sign of good fortune.

I'll cover the second species of shrew found in Singapore in a follow-up comment. Feel free to ask any questions you might have about shrews, and I'll try to answer them to the best of my ability. You can also share your own stories and anecdotes, or suggest other animals for me to cover in future.

The housewife is married to John, a 50-year-old educator, and they have an older son and a younger daughter.\n\nAll names have been changed to avoid the stigma associated with porn.\n\nPorn use among young people is ""becoming more concealed"", says Ms Andrea Chan, head of Touch Youth Intervention, whose services include helping youth who face challenges with Internet use.\n\nShe adds that it is harder for parents to track porn, and for monitoring apps to block it.\n\nUnlike in the past, when watching porn might be largely a solitary pursuit, Ms Chan has come across teenagers who watch porn with others. ""Even if they watch it alone, they talk to their friends about it (and) share codes and websites,"" she says.\n\nChristopher\'s case is probably far from unusual as more young people seem to be getting hooked on porn.\n\nTouch Youth Intervention saw a 50 per cent rise in the number of cases related to Internet porn addiction, from 2017 to last year, according to a Straits Times report in July. The median age was between 13 and 15, with the youngest just 10 years old.\n\nCyber-wellness experts say pornography is easily accessible, with the prevalent use of digital devices among children and teens.\n\nIn 2016, a survey of 921 students aged 13 to 15 by Touch Cyber Wellness, which gives talks on online safety in schools, found that nine in 10 teenage boys in Singapore had watched or read sexually explicit materials within the past year. The figure was less than 10 per cent for girls.\n\nFour per cent of the boys said they were first exposed to porn at lower-primary age or younger.\n\nThe 2016 survey found that 88 per cent of teenage boys viewed pornographic materials on their smartphones or tablets. This was an increase from a corresponding figure of 80 per cent of teenage boys, according to an earlier survey by Touch Cyber Wellness in 2014, which also studied teenage exposure to pornography.\n\nExperts say viewing porn can adversely affect children\'s attitudes and behaviour in love, intimacy and sex, as well as their self-esteem, personal relationships and academic studies.\n\nChristopher says he felt a sense of guilt and helplessness as he became hooked on porn. His parents helped him break the years-long habit, but it was a struggle for all three of them.\n\nChristopher says: ""It was an adrenaline rush - I felt good after I watched it. I would go back to it if I felt bored and didn\'t have anything exciting to do before dinner or bedtime.\n\n""Sometimes, I would think, can I even stop or is this going to go on forever?""\n\nWhen his parents first found out about his use of porn when he was 12, there was ""a quiet conversation, no shouting"", Christopher recalls.\n\n""My mother sat me down and told me why watching porn was wrong. She showed me from a Christian perspective what sex was about.""\n\nOutwardly calm, his mother was devastated inside. She had been involved in a church group that helped parents teach their children faith-based sex education, as well as Christian views on saving sex for after marriage.\n\nPamela says: ""I was shocked and discouraged. I was teaching other parents, but my son was watching porn. I felt I was a failure.""\n\nShe eventually realised the experience made her more empathetic to the challenges other parents faced.\n\nPamela and her husband John had been comfortable talking to their children about the birds and the bees from a young age.\n\nJohn says they had taught their children from the time they were pre-schoolers that there was nothing shameful about the human body and also spoke to them about creation, procreation and marriage.\n\nHe and his wife adopted a ""no shaming"" policy in helping Christopher tackle the problem of porn.\n\n""As a child, he was already feeling bad about it,"" says John. ""If (a problem) is no longer hidden, there\'s no shame. We have to expose it to stop being hooked.""\n\nAs Christopher and his parents were in it together, he was willing to change and accept being disciplined, John says.\n\nThe couple stepped up monitoring of the devices Christopher used and restricted screen-time even further. He had to use the laptop in the hall with the screen facing either parent.\n\nIt was a long road to rehabilitation. Even though his parents checked his smartphone when he first got one at the age of 13, Christopher managed to access porn on it and deleted pages he had visited.\n\nIn 2016, when he was 15, Christopher, his older brother and his dad attended a programme for men seeking to be free from porn.\n\nCalled Conquer, the church programme involved watching a video series on the topic and what John describes as meetings similar to AA (Alcoholics Anonymous), with small groups talking about dealing with porn.\n\nJohn\'s father had never talked to him about sex. John says he wanted to be a role model for his sons to learn how women should be honoured and never objectified.\n\nChristopher says the additional parental restrictions and the ""accountability"" he learnt from the church programme were helpful. He is now free from his porn habit.\n\nHis mother says: ""We need to extend a lot of grace to our children and ourselves. Everyone makes mistakes. There is no need to condemn anyone. We pick ourselves up and learn and grow.""\n\nFinding satisfaction in achievements that require him to work hard, rather than relying on sexual dopamine hits, also helped Christopher shake off the grip of porn.\n\n""I realised that if I kept playing computer games and watching porn - things that made me feel high - nothing actually gets done. Putting in more effort gave me more fulfilment,"" says Christopher, who has been focusing more on his schoolwork and skateboarding, a hobby he picked up recently.\n\n""Learning about discipline and delayed gratification was part of growing up,"" he says.\n\n## HOW PARENTS CAN HELP\n\nHere are some ways parents can help their children guard against the threat of pornography.\n\nDon\'t make your child feel like a freak\n\nMs Tham Yuen Han, executive director of We Care Community Services, says: ""It\'s part of adolescent development. As they change biologically,they are curious about their bodies and relationships. We don\'t want to pathologise them and call them addicts.\n\n""Many adults are uncomfortable having conversations about sex with their kids. Many young people turn to the Internet to find out more about sex, if they don\'t have adults they can trust to talk to.""\n\n## CHECK YOUR REACTION\n\nMs Carol Loi, founder of Village Consultancy, which provides digital literacy education, says: ""If you scold the child for accessing porn, he may not fully understand why. Calm down before processing the experience with him in a way that fits your family values regarding sex. What was he curious about? How did it make him feel?\n\n""It\'s not just about setting limits on screen time and using filters, but also about helping children deal with matters relating to sexuality. The conversation is diverse and should be ongoing, such as talking about relationships, peer pressure and dating. If we focus on only porn, we may be missing the point.""\n\nTalk about sexuality early\n\nMs Loi says: ""Use the early years to ground your children in talking about sexuality in healthy ways. Speak to them in developmentally appropriate ways. In pre-school, they can learn how men and women are different and the proper names for private parts. They may be curious about reproduction.\n\n""At lower-primary age, you can start to tell them about the changes during puberty that they will experience later.""\n\n## LET YOUR CHILD KNOW PORN IS NOT REALITY\n\nMs Loi says: ""Discuss with your children and teach them what is real and healthy, versus what is not. Porn does not portray reality. The people involved in porn seem willing (but consent is not discussed); they are actors and actresses in a commercial industry that is not about real intimacy.\n\n""Porn doesn\'t show how we should relate to one another in relationships. Women are seen as objects, rather than respected.""\n\n## FIND OUT WHY HE TURNS TO PORN\n\nMs Tham from We Care says: ""Keeping channels of communication open with your child can help him share why he is watching porn. It might be because he does not feel accepted by his friends or may be getting bullied; or the parents may be in conflict with each other or are too busy for the child. Then you can explore how to help the child address these other problems.""\n\n## ENCOURAGE NON-DIGITAL INTERESTS\n\nMs Tham says: ""Encourage non-digital forms of engagement with others, so that your child is not only having vicarious, on-screen experiences.\n\n""What you\'re encouraging is face-to-face social connection and interests, such as playing outdoors. This helps with self-esteem and feeling connected with the community.""']"

Yes, everyone giving $0.10 to charity can make a huge difference. Same with straws and totebags. But no one goes to think about who provided them and standardized them as a solution, and the implications for removing them. And it is definitely not through obligations and ""please and thank you"" that we will get everyone to use less straws or plastic bags, but though influential or coercive powers from certain groups that people move in a collective. \n\nSystems are built upon systems. The recent reddit discussion about the removal of plastic bags from shops, only to buy plastic bags instead still doesn\'t really solve problems, but rather just making people pay. Arguably, it can make people more conscious, but my point is: without the invention of plastic bags, we wouldn\'t rely on them and integrate them into part of the disposal system. Then there are other considerations such as pest control and health concerns from the lack of plastic usage after forceful removals of them. The most apt example I can think of is when some stores stopped providing straws during its initial phase, people went to OTHER stores to take them instead. \n\nI\'m also not saying we shouldn\'t do our part as individuals. What I want to see is more responsibilities being pushed to (1) the government and (2) corporations to do something instead of always individualising problems. Why should they get away being faulted just because what they do is seemingly more important? Just as labour is discussed in tripartite, so too should issues such as these. \n\nIn fact, here\'s a challenge thrown to both corporates and the government: I challenge the hosting of the 2020 National Day to be 100% reusable or recyclables.']"
281,singapore,186367,Serious discussion for military observers: What is Singapore's prospective military strategy in the event of a China-India naval war?,czes2i,botoxilum,1567564112,66,22,"China and India are land neighbours with a turbulent border that is 3,488 km long, all of which is entirely Himalayan, and all of which is entirely contested between the two. This border encompasses the Chinese autonomous regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, and the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh - the latter state being claimed by China in its entirety as part of southern Tibet. Both countries are currently ruled by hypernationalistic governments, and both countries have their fair share of frothing-at-the-mouth citizens. The Chinese Communist Party under Xi Jinping, who recently proclaimed himself leader for life, has become more nationalistic than ever before, and India, under its Hindu nationalist government, is increasingly being characterised as a 'fascist' country by some commentators because of the government's perceived anti-Muslim slant.

The Sino-Indian war of 1962 saw both sides going at it for the first time, with China capturing a slice of Indian territory in the cold desert of region of Ladakh of the northern Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, which borders both Xinjiang and Tibet. More recently, the 2017 border standoff between the two countries saw both of their armed forces deploying thousands of soldiers to the border tripoint between Tibet, Sikkim, and Bhutan.

In the event that both countries' ties were to deteriorate enough for there to be a kinetic war (outside of economic and/or cyber warfare) between the two, or if domestic pressures were to drive both countries to wage war, both countries would have three primary options for waging war on each other:

1) Thermonuclear war with warheads delivered via intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs);
2) A land war over the Himalayas, which would include the air forces of both countries having a go at each other over land;
3) Naval warfare in the South China Sea, the Malacca Strait, and the Bay of Bengal, which would also include the air forces of both countries having a go at each other over the sea and/or land, since both countries have aircraft carriers.

Nuclear war is firstly in the realm of fantasy, because neither country would be suicidal enough to do something so rash and foolish. This can be ruled out with a degree of certainty, unless Xi Jinping and/or Narendra Modi are psychopathic enough to press the nuclear button.

As for option 2, a protracted land war between the two would be nigh impossible for the simple reason that high-altitude warfare is extremely difficult, especially so in the world's highest mountain range. The 1962 war saw the Indian Army and the PLA facing off in a high-altitude cold desert plateau called Aksai Chin, which is flat and featureless, but Aksai Chin is hardly characteristic of the rest of their border, which is jagged and mountainous. Furthermore, both countries have only fought each other with ground troops and land-based artillery and hardware, not with fighter jets. This is again for the simple reason that dogfighting over mountains that are well north of 7,000m AMSL is extremely hazardous, and is unlikely to accomplish anything, because mountainous dogfighting will not help either country conquer the enemy's land or exact any form of hard-hitting punishment on the other in order to gain concessions. It will result in a stalemate.

Additionally, it is not realistic for China to deploy a large fleets of fighter jets to its Tibetan air bases adjacent to India for the simple reason that planes have operating issues at high-altitude airfields, burning fuel far more quickly and requiring longer take-off runs (and fighter jets are fuel-hungry beasts). China's fighter would be able to make it past the Himalayan peaks in order to run bombing runs on the Indian plains, but to turn back and have enough fuel to get back to the safety of the Tibetan air bases is another matter entirely.

This leaves one final option for the two countries, which is an option that could draw Singapore in in the worst way possible considering our geographic location: Naval warfare, which is the method of confrontation that most experts seem to agree upon ([National Interest](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/what-would-naval-war-between-china-india-really-look-24372), [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/08/07/who-will-win-the-sino-indian-naval-war-of-2020/)). More comprehensive information can be found in the quoted articles, but the general gist of the articles is this:

**A naval confrontation could take place in either the South China Sea (near China's 9-dash line), the Malacca Strait (off Singapore's western coast and between peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra), the Andaman Sea (around India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands), and/or the Bay of Bengal.**

Now all of this is hypothetical, but how, where, when, and why would Singapore respond to any such confrontation in our waters or our region? A response is almost completely guaranteed, because in such a situation, Singapore cannot afford to be a sitting duck and keep mum for the simple reason that any such confrontation would inevitably result in a naval blockade or embargo being imposed by either China in the South China Sea or India in the northern mouth of the Malacca Strait near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. This would completely choke off transshipment vessels on their way to Singapore's port, which would be extremely detrimental to our economy, especially when one considers that our ever-present reliance on our ports has lead to the construction of the Tuas Megaport. In light of this:

A) Would a Singaporean response be issued in isolation to tell both countries to back off and fight their war elsewhere, or would Singapore seek to issue a joint response with Malaysia, Indonesia, and perhaps a few other ASEAN countries in order shield itself from being the sole recipient of backlash from either country, if any? 

B) Would a Singaporean response be limited to a strongly-worded diplomatic statement made either in isolation or in tandem with other ASEAN countries, or would it include other measures, such as access denial (refusing to allow Chinese and Indian warships or aircraft carriers to refuel or dock at Changi Naval Base), or would Singapore begrudgingly allow the warships of either country to dock and refuel? Would this contravene our generally neutral posture, and would this tarnish our image in the eyes of either country, since this could give them the opportunity to accuse us of duplicity or taking sides?

C) At worst, could Singapore feel compelled, either by China, India, or ASEAN, to deploy naval forces in the midst of the action, therefore risking Singaporean assets and lives in a conflict that has nothing to do with us? Can someone with adequate knowledge of our military ties to either country chime in?

The eastwards shift of power has changed Singapore's security situation, which looks dramatically different today than it did in the early years of our independence. In those days, the Cold War and the threat of communism loomed over us. Today, the troubles in the South China Sea, the impending demise of Pax Americana, and Islamist terrorism loom over us. In the future, it may well be this.

This would certainly be an interesting discussion to have, especially from a Singapore-centric standpoint.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/czes2i/serious_discussion_for_military_observers_what_is/,0.0,['Not bad for a A-Level GP essay: B.']

A\n\n&gt; brighter future for our children. Build a better Singapore for our children.\n\n&gt; This seemed to be the main message of the National Day Rally (NDR) 2019. The\n\n&gt; word ‘children’ was used 13 times, and one of those was during the climate\n\n&gt; change segment of the speech, when PM Lee said, “We must make this effort.\n\n&gt; Otherwise one day, our children and grandchildren will be ashamed of what our\n\n&gt; generation did not do.” That day has already come. I am ashamed of what your\n\n&gt; generation is not doing for climate change.  I am not alone, or at least that’s\n\n&gt; what my Facebook feed tells me. On Instagram, lots of people vented their\n\n&gt; frustrations over the lack of mitigation measures raised during the NDR.  At the\n\n&gt; start of the NDR, PM Lee said, “Let me start with how we are giving our young\n\n&gt; the best possible start in life,” before going on to talk about pre-school\n\n&gt; education. The thought that crossed my mind when I heardthis segment was, ‘The\n\n&gt; best possible start you can give to the next generation, the young and the\n\n&gt; unborn, is a stable climate.” It’s great that we’re having pre-schools be more\n\n&gt; affordable to the masses and making education more affordable for those who need\n\n&gt; it so young parents don’t have to worry about costs, but the costs of raising a\n\n&gt; child is just one factor when young people think about starting a family. One\n\n&gt; major factor is also whether we’ll be bringing a child into a world that is\n\n&gt; getting less and less hospitable to humans, and this is a sentiment shared by\n\n&gt; many youths in my circle. Want birth rates in Singapore to increase? Consider\n\n&gt; looking after the climate. Rising temperatures, rising sea levels, more extreme\n\n&gt; weather, more frequent pandemics, food shortages, forced migration of displaced\n\n&gt; populations, and even wars were mentioned as examples of the impacts of climate\n\n&gt; change. There was even mention of a Swiss study which found that by 2050,\n\n&gt; Singapore will experience unprecedented climate shifts.  Climate change sure\n\n&gt; sounds like it’s going to screw us up real bad. But what are we doing about it?\n\n&gt; PM Lee says: understand climate change, mitigate climate change, and adapt to\n\n&gt; climate change.  Something must have gone wrong when writing the portion about\n\n&gt; mitigation because after mentioning that we must do our part to reduce CO2\n\n&gt; emissions, he gave the carbon tax half a sentence, and spent the rest of the\n\n&gt; time talking about how people should switch off the lights and practice the 3Rs.\n\n&gt; What about the fact that industries are responsible for more than 60% of\n\n&gt; Singapore’s emissions, compared to households which are responsible for 6%?\n\n&gt; What Pulau Semakau looks like / Image: Nas Daily    Yes, Semakau is filling up,\n\n&gt; and we don’t want to have to figure out how to do Bukit Semakau or Gunung\n\n&gt; Semakau. But the solution shouldn’t be for ordinary Singaporeans like Farah to\n\n&gt; start movements like Repair Kopitiam to advocate for individuals to reduce waste\n\n&gt; and consumption. Businesses are the ones who should be responsible for reducing\n\n&gt; waste generated from their products, and the government should be responsible\n\n&gt; for regulating businesses to ensure they d o so, instead of pushing the\n\n&gt; responsibility to ordinary citizens. PM Lee also mentioned that we must do our\n\n&gt; fair share of reducing emissions before we can be credible in asking others to\n\n&gt; reduce their emissions, and work towards a global solution to climate change.\n\n&gt; But how can we be credible when we aren’t going to be reducing our CO2 emissions\n\n&gt; till 2030? In fact, we’re simply going to increase our emissions at a slower\n\n&gt; rate until 2030!  I have nothing against adaptation since it secures Singapore\n\n&gt; against rising sea levels. But can we adapt our way out of rising temperatures,\n\n&gt; diseases, food shortages, or forced migration? I don’t think so.  One statement\n\n&gt; that stood out was this: “Everything else must bend at the knee to safeguard the\n\n&gt; existence of our island nation.” I fully agree with this, but it seems like our\n\n&gt; economy isn’t bending at the knee to take on the threat of climate change. All\n\n&gt; we seem to be doing is trying to increase GDP while continuing business as\n\n&gt; usual, and trying to extract every last cent we can from the fossil fuel\n\n&gt; industry on Jurong Island before it becomes unprofitable.  Sea levels rising due\n\n&gt; to climate change is one of the existential threats to Singapore. But instead of\n\n&gt; trying to limit sea levels by mitigating climate change, we’re trying to adapt\n\n&gt; by raising ourselves higher.  To all the points on mitigation, the government\n\n&gt; would probably say, “Yes, mitigation is important, but we only contribute 0.11%\n\n&gt; of global greenhouse gas emissions and therefore our contributions to global\n\n&gt; emissions are negligible. However, everyone should do their part by switching\n\n&gt; off the lights when not in use and recycling.” And that would distract from the\n\n&gt; fact that we contribute more than the 0.11% of emissions we are willing to be\n\n&gt; accountable for. Singapore is a major shipping and aviation hub, but emissions\n\n&gt; from international shipping and aviation fuels don’t count to our emissions even\n\n&gt; though they are almost 3 times of Singapore’s emissions. Our refineries also\n\n&gt; produce fossil fuels that are exported overseas and contribute to emissions\n\n&gt; elsewhere.  The most ironic thing? We’re going to be spending money to defend\n\n&gt; Jurong Island from the very sea level rise it has helped to create.    A view of\n\n&gt; ExxonMobil at Jurong Island.     Another ironic thing is that climate change is\n\n&gt; causing the ice in the Arctic to melt, which also affects Singapore’s position\n\n&gt; as a shipping hub, since ships will be able to traverse the northern passage and\n\n&gt; bypass Singapore in the future. But climate change and the melting Arctic seems\n\n&gt; to have been forgotten in our plans to double our port capacities to 72 million\n\n&gt; TEUs.  PM Lee ends his speech with this: “What we talk about, this Government,\n\n&gt; we will deliver.” I have no doubt that this is true. But what if what I want is\n\n&gt; not what you’re talking about?  What could have been shared at the NDR instead?\n\n&gt; Raising the carbon tax to at least USD$135 by 2030 as recommended by the IPCC.\n\n&gt; Announcing more ambitious targets on carbon emission reductions. Even announcing\n\n&gt; that Singapore plans to shut down the Tuas Coal Power Plant would have been more\n\n&gt; welcome than the segment on mitigating climate change with nothing new. Can we\n\n&gt; afford to not do more on climate change mitigation? I don’t think so.  And PM\n\n&gt; Lee, that is why I am ashamed of what your generation is not doing.

Are there any official statements by our govt? News outlets, clickbait articles? Or we just bo chap in general?

At the current moment, I am pro-HK for the simple reason that I am pro-human rights and democracy. It's disgusting seeing officials try to label a protest which has enough numbers of educated young people to crash an entire state functions as hooligans, terrorists and cockroaches. However, I think even if the protestors manage to get concessions from Beijing for now, the entire mess will repeat again in 2047, and by that time, Beijing would be justified in using whatever means is necessary to silence dissent, since HK is legally their territory. Do they (protestors) have any fallback plans for this inevitability?

I don't like the mentality of might makes right, as shown in recent worldwide rallies for HK, where anti-protestor mainland Chinese just shout slurs and threaten violence without actually contributing anything to a reasoned debate that pro-HK protestors are in the wrong. 

Attempting to seize control 20 years early was a bold move, and the way I see it, if Hong Kong loses this fight, CCP would be free to act with impunity and annex whatever goddamn territory they please, since it shows the world has no backbone to protect human rights against the powerhouse known as China. First HK, then Taiwan, then SEA, then the rest of the world. I don't see any hope of useful resolutions being passed by the UN after their meeting, only 'strongly worded condemnations', since China has veto power anyway.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/cryc6j/what_is_the_singaporean_stance_on_hk_protests/,0.0,['Shanmugam has made a statement.

287,singapore,183380,Looking for some advice regarding my situation at home.,crk0jf,Vigram89,1566033953,88,0,"Hi,

Just wanted to get some advice regarding my situation. Mods please feel free to remove the post if it's against the rules are not suitable to the sub.

First a little background information. I am a foreigner who came to Singapore last year to join a course which provided an internship opportunity once I completed my modules. The college will arrange for 3 interviews and if none of them are successful I would have to do a project instead, the duration for both of them is 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been living with my brother here and things were ok for a few months, but last December I argued with my sister in law, and I stopped talking to her. I had also started eating outside. I didn't have any employment so I had to use my mom's card to order food online and either pick it up or have it delivered, but around April my mom's card stopped working and my brother started giving me money to buy food.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my sister in law is very stingy when it comes to money and whenever my brother takes me out shopping, to the movies, or buys me anything to eat she will start a fight when we come back home, this was one of the reasons I argued with her in December, and I also stopped going with my brother after that. So it should be obvious how she feels about my brother giving me money.

&amp;#x200B;

Coming to the internship situation, my modules ended in March and I was waiting for the college to arrange an interview while I was also applying for jobs, but none of my applications were shortlisted since I don't have any working experience so I waited until the college arranged me an interview at the end of May. I attended the interview but I didn't get selected so I waited again for them to arrange me a second interview, but I didn't get any other interviews, and in July they told me to do the project, and while I was doing the project they said that they will still keep looking for any internship opportunities, so I started the project.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier in December my sister in law had suggested doing a part-time job and that she knew someone who would hire me, but I wasn't interested because it was related to accounting, and I didn't know accounting work, plus I didn't want to do anything illegal because I was in a student pass, and it was against the rules to work.

Yesterday while I was inside my room I heard my sister in law complaining to my brother about me ordering food, using my brother's money, and not getting a job, so I got angry and went out and yelled at her, and I said I am not spending your money, and she got no right to complain about me not working when she also doesn't work, and that its not my fault I didn't get a job or internship yet because the college didn't arrange the interviews they promised, she then said that the person who she knew from the college had told her that I didn't go to the interviews and I didn't show any interest, which was a complete lie. Then she brought up the accounting job, and I said I didn't want to work while holding a student pass since it wasn't legal. We continued arguing, but I had class so I left after a while.

&amp;#x200B;

When I came back from the class she came into my room and yelled me to get out of her house, and to stop spending my brother's money, and to book the flight ticket myself, and I just ignored her. Later on, I heard her speaking to my brother on the phone and saying that she is going to file a police complaint against me. My brother hasn't spoken to me either and he is one her side.

&amp;#x200B;

So to whoever has read through my entire rant, I would like to hear some advice on what I should do next, and how I should protect myself in case she is going to file a police complaint, even though there is no probable cause. Should I continue staying here? or go back to my country?

Mr Calvin Alexander Neo is one of 30 finalists at this year's Mr World Singapore pageant. In 2009, he was sentenced to 13 years' jail and 15 strokes of the cane. While in prison, he did well in his O and A levels, which secured him a place at NUS after his early release in February last year.

Joyce LimSenior Correspondent

In 2009, when Mr Calvin Alexander Neo was sentenced to 13 years' jail and 15 strokes of the cane, the future looked dim for the self-described teen terror.

He was only 21 years old when he went to Changi Prison and for the first four years of his sentence, he was in a cell by himself.

Mr Neo, who was behind bars for around nine years after taking remission into account, said a court order prevents him from discussing his case but offenders sent to the maximum-security prison are often those involved in serious matters, including drug trafficking, culpable homicide, kidnapping and rape.

""I was so afraid of being alone and I kept thinking of my sentence - that I had a long way to go. I knew I had to do something to survive in there,"" Mr Neo recalled.

He decided to work out and get ripped. Mr Neo, who is currently a computer science undergraduate at the National University of Singapore (NUS), said exercise kept him sane.

He now dreams of becoming the world's most desirable man.


ADVERTISING

Encouraged by friends who love his great physique, Mr Neo auditioned for the Mr World Singapore pageant some time in April this year. The 30-year-old, who was released from prison in February last year, was shortlisted with 29 others for the finals, which will be held on Sept 19.

SETTING GOALS

I was afraid of having to spend the rest of my life in jail, like them. I decided to set a goal - to study and get into a top university in Singapore.

MR CALVIN ALEXANDER NEO, who was released from prison in February last year, on meeting many people sentenced to life imprisonment during his time in prison.
Mr Neo's story, the organiser said, fits perfectly with this year's theme - Changing Perceptions, Changing Lives.

Beam Artistes, which has organised pageants such as Manhunt Singapore and Best Model of the World, is organising Mr World Singapore for the first time. Sponsored by Miss World Organisation, the Mr World pageant was founded in 1996.

""In prison, I read many magazines like Men's Health and Cleo. I was very curious,"" said Mr Neo.

""Joining the contest has allowed me to gain new experiences. I got to watch Kurios (a Cirque du Soleil production) and went for eyebrow embroidery. At Gymmboxx, I had a fitness trainer teaching me how to do proper exercises.""

The 24-hour gym, a sponsor of Mr World Singapore 2019, provided the fitness trainer for free to contestants. It was a very different world from the one he experienced in his teenage years.

At 11, he joined a gang and spent all his time playing computer games and getting into fights.

He spent three years in Singapore Boys' Home. At 18, Mr Neo made the biggest mistake of his life.

Although he was forthcoming with other information, even providing his O-and A-level certificates, he insisted he cannot discuss his case.

In prison, he did between 300 and 500 push-ups and sit-ups every day. If there was yard time in the morning, he would play basketball with other inmates or jog.

When he returned to the cell after lunch, he would continue to exercise. Mr Neo would walk around the cell and do push-ups and sit-ups.

His jailhouse bodybuilding routine, which included dips and squats, soon grew into an addiction.

Even after receiving 15 strokes of the cane, he resumed his exercise routine the next day.

""The caning was the worst thing that has happened in my life,"" said Mr Neo.

""I was so scared. I was shaking when I saw how the flesh split open and blood streamed from the wounds of the person ahead of me.""

During his first four years in prison, he met many people sentenced to life imprisonment.

Mr Nabil, 27, was incarcerated for drug abuse. He has spent the last month in the IT programme launched by the Yellow Ribbon Fund and the Acronis Foundation, to help gain employment after his release.

""I was afraid of having to spend the rest of my life in jail, like them. I decided to set a goal - to study and get into a top university in Singapore,"" said Mr Neo, who was later transferred to a cell which he shared with three other inmates.

Besides exercising, he spent time reading in the cell. He said he may have read over 1,000 books while in prison, from the popular Harry Potter novels to Game Of Thrones and Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad.

Mr Neo believes education is the key to success. Although he scored only a pass in Maths at O levels before he went to jail, he did well in both O and A levels while in prison.

His A-level score included three As and two Bs. It secured him a place at NUS after his early release from prison.

Mr Neo, who comes from a low-income family, said his studies were fully funded by the Yellow Ribbon Fund (YRF).

A YRF spokesman did not discuss his case specifically but said the YRF Star (Skills Training Assistance to Restart) bursary aims to lend support to those from lower-income backgrounds who wish to further their education while reintegrating into society.

The spokesman added that since 2010, the programme has helped 81 beneficiaries complete their tertiary education.

Mr Neo, whose parents divorced before his release, said: ""During my time in jail, a few prison wardens taught me how to set goals. Success stories of ex-convicts like lawyer Darren Tan also inspired me.""

Mr Tan, who was called to the Bar in 2014, once spent over 10 years behind bars - where he also received 19 strokes of the cane - for drug-and gang-related offences.

""Now I hope to show ex-convicts how we can break out of the second prison we all face after our release.

""Many face the risk of re-offending. It's about self-control. But if you are determined to change your life, then you won't be tempted to go back to the old ways.""


A mom's agony: her son rapes daughter

IT was a dilemma no parent should ever have to face.

What should a mother do when her young daughter is a rape victim - and her son is the rapist?

It was a nightmare for Madam Jane (not her real name), a 40-year-old former masseuse who said her three children are her only reason for living.

Between 2005 and 2007, her elder son raped his younger sister three times and outraged her modesty on a number of occasions.

The girl, now 16, was only 12 or 13 when her ordeal began. Her brother, who was around 17 then, is now a 21-year-old full-time National Serviceman attached to the Singapore Civil Defence Force.

We are not naming anyone in the report to protect the victim.

Yesterday, Madam Jane was not in court when her son was sentenced to 13 years in jail and 15 strokes of the cane after he pleaded guilty to his offences. She could not bear ""the weight"" of it, she told The New Paper in Mandarin.

Looking haggard and pale in their three-room flat in the Queenstown area, Madam Jane claimed that she first found out about her son's crime when she secretly flipped through her daughter's diary.

She said: ""My daughter loves to write a diary. From it, I learnt a lot about her. She wrote that she hated her brother.

""She wanted to kill her brother for what he did to her. But she also wrote, 'if I kill him, won't my parents hate me?'""

Madam Jane said she discovered the rapes some time in 2008, about a year before her son's arrest on 2 June 2009.

The rapes happened in the family home, in the bedroom the two siblings shared.

Still looming over Madam Jane's tear-stained face in the cramped living room where she spoke were trophies that her son had won in various sporting competitions.

They still sat on the top shelf of the cabinet, as if no thing had changed. What did she do when she found out?

""I called my sister in Canada. I told her I suspected that my son had raped my daughter. Do you know how hard that was?"" she said.

To try and resolve the issue and protect her daughter, she tried to get the girl to go to Canada to live with her aunt

Her daughter refused - because of her boyfriend, Madam Jane claimed.

But why didn't Madam Jane call the police?

Her response seemed to indicate that she could not bring herself to do so and was hoping her daughter would take the first step.

""One is my son, the other is my daughter. What can I do? I thought that if any action is taken, it must be her decision,"" she said.

Madam Jane said she dropped heavy hints to her daughter, saying if anything was wrong, she should go to the court and that she would stand by her daughter.

""I told her, if anything is wrong, you must talk,"" she said.

Madam Jane also said she spoke to her husband about this, but he said she was fantasising.

She added that he did not ""wake up"" until the charge sheet was in his hands.

Her son's crimes had come to light after her daughter informed her secondary school principal about the molests and rapes by her brother.

The daughter made a police report on 30 Apr 2009.

At that time, she was living in her then-boyfriend's home. Run away from home She had run away from home at the end of 2007, without telling her parents the truth.

Earlier that year, the son had punched his sister on the face and body several times in their flat after she confronted him about the sexual abuse when both their parents were out.

She fled to her neighbour's place. The police were called and later advised her parents to apply for a Personal Protection Order (PPO) for her. But they eventually decided not to do so. When asked why they didn't apply for the PPO, Madam Jane said she encouraged her daughter to do so, but she wasn't keen.

She said of her son: ""He was bad-tempered at the time. Very brash. He couldn't control himself.""

Sweeping her hands in an arc, she added: ""The house wasn't always like that. It was pristine.

""But after one fight with his father, he smashed everything. He took a hammer and broke every glass panel in the house. It happened around two years ago. Twice in one year.""

The court was told that Madam Jane and her husband were estranged and slept in different rooms.

She feels partly responsible for what happened.

""At that time I was busy earning money. This is a tragedy. It might be the result of the family's issues - everyone was stressed,"" she said.

She claimed that her husband, a crane driver, suffered from depression and had some ""outside issues"" which she refused to elaborate on.

""Maybe what happened to his father may have left my son some psychological scars.

Maybe if I had the courage to face it, or get a divorce, things might have been different,"" she said.

She also admitted that she disappeared from their lives for about half a year about three years ago when she developed a growth on her chest.

She left the home as didn't want her children to see how badly she was suffering.

The ailment has not been diagnosed. Madam Jane said she has not seen a doctor as she is worried about a bad diagnosis.

At least, in ignorance, she can still give herself hope, she said.

But she believes her son is truly repentant.

""On the day the police came for him, he came before me on his knees and asked for my forgiveness,"" she said.

He told her his greatest fear was that she and her mother, who's in her 60s, would not be alive to see him after he's released from prison as they were both in poor health.

She showed The New Paper a handwritten letter he had sent her the day before yesterday's sentencing.

In it, he wrote: ""I hope you recover soon.

And granny too. Hope you will be healthy soon. Although I don't know what sickness you have, I know you will recover soon and take me home after I am released from prison.""

But she admitted that her son deserved to go to jail for what he had done.

""I want my son to learn a lesson.

I know he'll be in jail for a long time. I know he will suffer. But he must learn,"" she said.



Barely 13 when brother first raped her

FROM 2005 to 2007, the accused raped his younger biological sister three times. He also molested her three times during this period.

The victim, who's five years younger than him, was only 12 or 13 when the first rape occurred.

The court was told that each time, it happened late at night when the girl was asleep.

At the time, the siblings shared a bedroom, with the girl sleeping on a mattress next to his bed. The second son was living with his godfather.

The accused had assumed the victim was unaware of his actions. But the girl was awake. She made no move out of fear and embarrassment.

He did not use any contraception when he committed the acts.

Before each act of sexual abuse, the accused had watched pornographic material on the Internet.

He pleaded guilty to two counts of rape and one count of outrage of modesty. Three other similar charges were taken into consideration during sentencing.

He also pleaded guilty to three traffic-related offences.

He was caught riding his father's motorcycle without his permission, a valid driving licence or valid insurance when he was stopped at a road block along Farrer Road on 30 Jan 2009.

He was sentenced to 13 years in jail and given 15 strokes of the cane. For rape, he could have been jailed 20 years and caned.

For outrage of modesty, he could have been jailed two years and caned.

Eng, who was in the office, armed himself with a penknife bearing a 10.5cm-long blade and lied to his manager that he needed it to adjust his electric scooter.\n\n&gt; He concealed the penknife in his back pocket and armed himself with a motorcycle helmet before leaving.\n\n&gt; When he saw Mr Batman outside United House, Eng started swinging the motorcycle helmet at Mr Batman\'s head repeatedly.\n\n&gt; Mr Batman tried to use his arm to block the blows, but was still struck on the left side of his head, and the helmet fell to the ground.\n\n&gt; Other FoodPanda riders tried to stop Eng, but could not.\n\n&gt; HE SLASHED BATMAN\'S FACE\n\n&gt; Eng then picked up the penknife that had fallen from his pocket to the ground, and charged towards Mr Batman, defying other riders who tried to restrain him.\n\n&gt; As Mr Batman backed away, he tripped and fell, and Eng slashed at his face repeatedly with the penknife.\n\n&gt; Although Mr Batman tried to ward off the blows with his arms, he was cut near his nose and above his ear.\n\n&gt; The other riders managed to push Eng away, but he still managed to charge at Mr Batman and threw some punches at his face.\n\n&gt; He stopped his onslaught only after colleagues from the FoodPanda office arrived at the scene and managed to pull him away.\n\n&gt; Mr Batman then went to a nearby police station along with some riders to lodge a report.\n\n&gt; He sought medical treatment at Singapore General Hospital later that day and was found to have lacerations over his nose, face and hand.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; A doctor said in a medical report that the cuts on his face are expected to leave scars when healed.\n\n&gt; Eng pleaded guilty on Wednesday to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon, with a second charge of causing hurt with the helmet taken into consideration.\n\n&gt; SIGNIFICANT PREMEDITATION, DID NOT TRY TO RESOLVE MINOR GRIEVANCE\n\n&gt; The prosecutor pushed for the sentence that was eventually given, saying that there was significant premeditation on Eng\'s part, as he had armed himself with not one but two weapons before meeting Mr Batman.\n\n&gt; He did not even attempt to resolve what was essentially a very minor grievance, said the prosecutor, but started lashing out at the younger man with the helmet when he met him.\n\n&gt; The assault was a sustained one, first with the use of the helmet, then the penknife, said Mr Kok.\n\n&gt; Even when Mr Batman was on the ground, Eng continued to slash at his face, targeting his head and face with the penknife.\n\n&gt; Mr Batman sustained serious injuries, said the prosecutor, and there is a possibility of scarring.\n\n&gt; He noted also that Eng had a string of previous convictions, starting from theft in 1999 and a similar offence of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon in 2004, for which he received two years\' jail and six strokes of the cane.\n\n&gt; BATMAN ANNOYED MY CLIENT: DEFENCE\n\n&gt; Defence lawyer T M Sinnadurai said Mr Batman had repeatedly annoyed and challenged Eng. The prosecutor said he could accept that Mr Batman had annoyed Eng, but pointed to the statement of facts which said Eng had started the fight.\n\n&gt; Mr Sinnadurai said the helmet used was more like a bicycle helmet and was relatively light, and that the medical report did not indicate serious injuries, as Mr Batman received only four days\' medical leave and the longest laceration measured only 3cm.\n\n&gt; ""Nevertheless it is indeed a serious offence where a knife was used and the accused is not making any excuses for his actions,"" said the lawyer.\n\n&gt; ""He is telling this court that he will change to a new leaf and stay away from committing further offences of any nature.""\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; For voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon, Eng could have been jailed for up to seven years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments.\n\n&gt; Mr Batman became an Internet celebrity for his unusual name about a decade ago and made global headlines in 2013 after he was jailed for two years and nine months for theft, housebreaking and taking heroin.\n\n&gt; \n\n---\n1.0.1 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

  I have briefly hinted, not so subtlety, in the previous section my scorn for the idea of mandatory conscription (National Service or NS for short). However, I still feel that my displeasure and dissent needed more substantiation, which will be provided in this section. While this is not a problem with people per sé, it is the people's unquestioning nature that has landed the youth of today in this exact position. Many successful international drug cartels can operate because there is a steady stream of fresh recruits, along with long-established connections. They prey on the vulnerable, typically immigrants who are powerless and desperate, stuck between a rock and a hard place. Ingrained in many of these gangs and cartels is a strong sense of comradery, loyalty to a cause every member knows is dubious…… 

Is it necessary?
  Let me address the big elephant in the room first. The main argument that the Singapore Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) uses to justify the necessity of compulsory conscription is the small population of Singapore and the unwillingness for young, able-bodied people to serve if made voluntary. The common premise of the argument is that they need a military of a certain size to be effective at repelling a hostile advance. They quote Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong (a bizarre case of nepotism in what is supposed to be a democracy but let's not get into that) who said, ”For a small country like Singapore, acquiring and nurturing human talent is a matter of survival”.
in the online paper ”Motivation and Retention in the SAF”.

  However, it would be extremely naive to think that the effectiveness of a military depends predominantly on the number of meatbags you toss at the enemy. This was never the case in historical warfare and definitely still not the case in the 21st century. The outcome of war has always been determined by strategic decisions and information warfare more than it has been about sheer numbers. That is why there have been numerous instances of outnumbered armies emerging as victors in decisive battles, outnumbered even to as large an extent as 25:1. Therefore, we see that in the real world, operations readiness is not determined simply by numbers. Even MINDEF has outlined that the core challenge for the fourth generation SAF would be to improve institutional agility and maintain core operational readiness. Institutional agility refers to detection time, response time, and communication time among others. Nowhere in this chain of relaying information or commands does increasing sheer numbers with 100% certainty prove to be more beneficial than detrimental. Rather, operational readiness in the age of rapid technological advancement is all about improved systems, strategic modelling and better weapons. At a time when a single unmanned drone can eradicate paramilitary forces in Central Asia the size of an entire platoon, perhaps Singapore should shifts its focus from buffing up the military in terms of the number of people it drafts, and tap into the potentials of autonomous or semi autonomous machinery and technologies. 

  Even if our hostile engagements with foreign powers do boil down to numbers, recognise that Singapore is an incredibly small nation that is unable to amass a sizeable army to deter almost any nation. Take Malaysia for instance and their Armed Forces which is 110 thousand strong. Even including conscript in Singapore, we only have roughly 72000 active duty servicemen to play around with. So instead of throwing the extra conscripts into a hopeless, dying fight, training them to pass standards of physical fitness which are far from relevant, perhaps we can divert more manpower towards STEM research and innovation in the field of defense.

  Another factor that is often left out in this discussion is the importance of diplomatic and strategic allies in providing sufficient deterrence. At the height of the Cold War, it was the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) solidarity which drove home the concept of mutually assured destruction which prevented the start of a nuclear war. So to claim that allies have no place in this discussion and to dismiss them entirely is a major cop-out. We have to take into account the fact that Singapore is a nation with many powerful allies. Singapore is part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements along with Malaysia, Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Good relations are also maintained with the United States, a strong military ally and one of the world’s 9 nuclear powers. In fact, the only kinks in international relations for Singapore are the occasional squabbles with Malaysia. However, if Singapore’s main potential aggressor is Malaysia, deterrence by punishment (military or otherwise) from third parties such as the UN, global superpowers like the US will be more than enough to deter a nation like Malaysia, which has neither the financial strength to wage a war, nor the military might to anticipate a coalitional counter-attack. Furthermore, the value of allies is not limited to the military aid they provided but also the information they may relay to us, allowing us to gain time to anticipate an invasion and launch preemptive strikes.

   2. Is it personally enriching?
  If NS is not essential for the country’s security in a practical sense, the cheerleaders turn to a secondary, less tangible and more unproven benefit. They will claim that NS is the monumental step in any boy’s journey to growing up, that NS instills unteachable values like resilience, independence and stoicism. 

  To some extent, the abovementioned statements are undeniable, tangible boons. Still, the mere existence of a benefit does not justify the need for a legal mandate. Self-help classes could change the course of someone’s life for the better, but the government does not railroad every citizen into taking one. Vaccines, however, have been a marvelous weapon for humanity to fight once pervasive and infectious diseases like small-pox, and are legally required in some states or countries. What distinguishes vaccines from self-help courses is not the benefit they bring to the individual, but the incomparable harm to the rest of society they prevent. By defaulting to the secondary argument of personal enrichment, the pro-government, pro-NS loudspeakers have not fulfilled their burden to prove substantial harm in the counterfactual. Furthermore, they neglect the fact that personal enrichment should be at the sole discretion of, quite obviously, the person and that there are other, less strenuous ways to gain these soft skills. Arguing against the latter point would be as insulting, downright condescending and self-absorbed as saying the other 180 over nations in the world without mandatory conscription are overrun with boys that never grew up. What's more, does this argument not imply that women do not need to and never grow up? (more will be discussed in subsection 4) Clearly, this line of reasoning raises more questions than it answers.

   3. Is it dutiful?
  Another argument you would hear often is that NS is a way of fulfilling every individual’s duty to the nation. They posit that simply by being born in Singapore, we as men do have the obligation to our fellow countrymen to serve the nation. But why is such a duty assumed? Could it be because the country has provided its citizens with services that increased their quality of life, such as protection, safety, education, healthcare and other remaining rights and social benefits?

  To argue against the social contract theory lite argument we need to ask a very fundamental question: Are we, in accepting these services, implicitly consenting to give up the better portion of our prime to our country? The answer is no, and here is why. Firstly, we do not get to choose which country we are born in, and in fact are given no reasonable way to opt out of these services. Sure, emigration is a possibility, however, the bureaucratic hurdles and restrictions make that an unreasonable proposition. In Singapore specifically, broad and all-encompassing laws like the Sedition Act which have the sole purpose of silencing dissent means that our fates are sealed and we are forced into this contract, no negotiation of terms. Therefore, we opt into these services under duress, shoehorned into the only option and being forced to sign a horribly flawed contract. No consent is given. In the same way that contracts signed at gunpoint are legally void, the social contract with no reasonable way of opting out should be non-binding.

  Secondly, it is important that we do not conflate the act of resignation with the act of consent. An action can only be interpreted as consenting if the consenting party can believe that in refusing the action, an obligation will not be imposed on them by an authoritative figure. As Michael Huemer objected in his book ”The Problem of Political Authority”:

Suppose that in the board meeting example, the chairman announces, ‘Next week’s meeting will be moved to Tuesday at ten o’clock, and I don’t care what any of you have to say about it – the schedule change will happen whether you object to it or not. Now, does anyone want to object?’ He pauses. No one says anything. ‘Good, it’s agreed’, he declares. In this case, there is no valid agreement. Though the board members were given a chance to object, they were also given to understand that if they objected, the schedule change would be imposed anyway. Their failure to express objections therefore cannot be taken to indicate agreement. It may simply indicate that they did not wish to waste their breath protesting something about which they had no choice.
  
  In Singapore, one-party totalitarianism has made it extremely clear to the common folk that even if they objected to certain social policies by the government (their end of the bargain) or the limitations reciprocally imposed on individual liberty (our end of the bargain), no discernable change will happen. Therefore, to suggest that through inaction of the people to protest policies like NS implies consent to the social contract (which is drafted entirely by the authority) and a duty to serve is completely bogus.

  Others I have met with thicker skulls have claimed without reason that the duty derives intrinsically from the need for some common good. They would argue that for the greater good of the rest of the country, we must play a part to defend our ”home”. However, as explained in section 2.1, I, along with many people in the world, am selfish by nature. I have no desire to protect those I have no personal connection with, so as far as I am concerned, my only moral duty is to my personal safety. Even if you were to accept that such a moral duty exists, how are the women in society fulfilling this duty?

   4. Is it fair?
  When prompted for an answer to the question ”How are the women serving the nation if not through mandatory conscription?”, I distinctly recall a muppet jokingly reply, ”By giving birth!” before proceeding to laugh like a maniacal idiot. So does that imply that those who choose not to give birth should be sent to jail because they have not fulfilled their duty? And why is that we in the 21 century still levy Confucian era expectations on men and women? 

  Singapore is a first world country with third world culture and norms. With a largely conservative Chinese and Muslim population, many are accustomed to the fact that males and females fulfill different roles in society, the same roles as it has always been in previous centuries. Men are told to protect, women are told to be subservient. Believing in personal liberty, I am perfectly fine with some people bearing that notion. Yet at the same time, I take objection to when people’s beliefs (no matter how prevailing they have been) are made into law without basis, especially when it impedes on my personal liberty! That would be the equivalent of criminalising blasphemy by punishment by death because the Christian faith condemns it and has always did. In this subsection, I argue that there is nothing intrinsically, biologically unique about men that justifies this preferential treatment towards women, and thereby go on to prove the injustices done deliberately by the government amount to atrocities and a gross violation of human rights.

  Firstly, some people postulate that men naturally have characteristics which are quintessential to becoming an assertive leader, a resilient member of a team. They believe that NS ”unlocks” this manly potential in all males, and therefore NS is a rite of passage for boys to become men, thereafter which they live up to society’s expectation of them. However, is societal expectation the result of innate immeasurable personality differences, or are personality differences a by-product of societal expectation? This is like the famous chicken and egg riddle, except the answer is much simpler. 

  There have been quite an overwhelming consensus in the field of sociology that gender roles and expectations are ascribed externally and not the result of intrinsic differences between males and females. There have been a vast body of literature including ”Masculinity and Femininity” by acclaimed sociologist Janet Spence which states ”Definitive data are lacking regarding the existence of genetically determined differences in the temperamental makeup of men and women. There is evidence in abundance, however, to indicate that human personality is highly malleable” and a study famously termed the ”Bashing Bo Bo” experiment which showed that the social behaviour of children (boys and girls) can be acquired by observation and intimidation. Both of this evidence shows that humans, regardless of gender, are highly influenced by how society as a whole act and expects them to act, creating the illusion that it men are intrinsically masculine in character and women are intrinsically feminine in nature. Even more evidence to support this fact is that across cultures, there have been recorded instances where the gender roles we typically assume in Singapore are completely inverted. In agricultural parts of Bamenda, Cameroon or Tchambuli tribes in Papua New Guinea, physically arduous and strenuous tasks were given women in the society while men were expected to be more gentle and sensitive. In the Kibbutzim settlements in Israel, or the Mundugumor people in Papua New Guinea, there were no distinction in labour between men and women Nor were there any differences in the character of a man and a woman. The evidence is manifest. Any person, male or female, when punitively discouraged or encouraged to act a certain way can be brought up to a man or a woman.

  If not for temperamental differences, the same group of people turn to more pronounced biological differences to justify their point. They claim that the additional X or Y chromosome gives rise to differences in physiology and physical fitness, which makes men more suitable for the army.

  However, that argument is a very slippery slope. If we are at a time whereby we can equivocate over differences in genetics and use those very differences to discriminate, then why stop there? Perhaps we should exclusively draft people with the ACTN3 gene, which has been linked to the increased formation of fast twitch muscle fibres thereby increasing athletic performance. Or maybe we should get all the people with two copies of the ACE-1 allele to serve because that gene has been linked to the increased production of an enzyme which converts a hormone angiotensin in to a form usable by skeletal muscles. Actually, while we are here in the land of hypothetical but equally extreme measures the government could take to get more people in the SAF, why not go full-on fascist. We can slowly eliminate people without those “superhuman-like” genes through a series of social policies and marriage restrictions such that Singapore will be a nation of Super-soldiers. A bit of “Yew-genics” if you will.

  The point is, when you discriminate people over something as predetermined as genetics, you are criminalising and condemning a group of completely innocent people to a life of suffering, suffering which is completely unnecessary and easily preventable. Unlike the paradigm of the blind or the intellectually disabled, this suffering is not the result of an unfortunate birth lottery, but inflicted externally by the ruling party, something the government can and should change.

  To clarify, I am not suggesting that as an individual reading this, you should care about the victimised. I am, however, suggesting that the government, to gain legitimacy to rule, should fulfill its fundamental duty to the people that is to reduce the suffering of its citizens.

   5. Is it insufferable?
  A few people may disagree with my framing of NS as immeasurable suffering, so let me substantiate that claim in this subsection.

  Firstly, NS requires all males who are of age to spend 2 years of their lives doing a job that, for most, have nothing to with their intended career. That is 2 years of your life you could have spent in university, getting a job, gaining job experience or being in a relationship, et cetera. Your life is being put on hold while the whole world keeps chugging on. That is not even counting the total man hours lost to reservist. In many aspects, National Service is no different from serving time, only that in prison, you are not taught to worship your jailers. NS is a test of your patience and tolerance, and the total lost productivity in terms of career advancement are short term anchors to fair employment and long term hindrances to personal happiness, which is tantamount to suffering. 
  
  Secondly, there is the physical labour and psychological torment. NS involves physically rigorous exercises and drills to train soldiers to be battle ready, which for a wimp like myself to be forced to my physiological limit with no way to object, is more than enough to constitute torture, a molestation of my personal freedom and a gross human right violation (Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). Another (most likely intended) side-effect of NS is that it conditions enlistees to be subservient to authority. Superiors would frequently berate you in degrading ways for challenging their authority, no matter how flawed their logic. In the SAF, all individuality is gone, you are funnelled into one way of thinking, indoctrinated into believing that protecting Singapore is of your utmost priority and you are punished severely, both physically and mentally, if you think otherwise. There is also the “tekan” culture (derived from the Malay word meaning to endure pain) that is still residual in sergeants from an older generation. They believe that soldiers should learn to be tough, not express discomfort and pain, and hence find it well founded to shame, demean and verbally abuse recruits who speak up when they are on the brink of breaking. This creates a climate very similar to “Don’t ask, don’t tell” in the US in the ‘90s, only what is at stake is not pride and identity, but something as serious as a person’s life.

  It should go without saying that NS has led to a number of fatalities over the years. The SAF’s response has always superficial and unapologetic. Beyond the “deep condolence” expressed at funerals, MINDEF has been slow to provide answers to the families and accountability to the public. In statements to the public, Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen has always maintained that the public should not jump to conclusions while internal committee investigations are conducted while simultaneously categorically denying the SAF should be held responsible. In the September of 2017, when full-time NS men Chan Hiang Cheng Gavin was crushed and killed by an infantry vehicle, a committed of inquiry (COI) has vowed to uncover the truth and review safety protocols in the army. 6 months later when another NS man, Dave Lee Han Xuan dies of heat injuries, the committee again, almost regimentally, promised a thorough investigation and review of safety precautions. Yet, neither the internal COI nor MINDEF has kept its promise. At the time of Private Lee’s death, there has still been no answers the Gavin Chan death, no closure, no overhaul of safety procedures. Nothing. This prompted a non-constituency member of parliament (NCMP) Dennis Tan (WP) to question, ”It has been more than half a year since the accident and no information has been shed on how the accident took place and what lessons have been learnt or changes that will be made for SAF training protocols"" as a result. Other notable cases of the SAF’s half-arsed response to these deaths include Sarron Lee’s death, Jonas Stadden’s death and Nigel Loh’s death, all of which the families affected claimed they have not received answers from MINDEF. 

  The SAF, for the first time in its history, has allowed an external review panel to be part of its COI in May 2018 following a spate of preventable deaths. While the COI’s finding was damning in acknowledging wrongdoings including 2 safety breaches by trainers believed to have directly caused the death, the external panel goes even further. They strongly condemn the culture of stoicism and the prevailing “teken” culture which has the potential to cause more deaths, recommending “a) strongly respecting and complying with safety rules and guidelines; b) being willing to speak out when there are safety concerns; c) taking greater care of themselves and each other; and d) open-reporting so as to share lessons and prevent future accidents.” The report goes on to point out that on-site medics could have been more responsive and that commanders need to adhere more strictly to safety standards. A not so subtle indication that the SAF has been covering up its lax safety practices and punishing those who speak up, creating a culture of fear which discourages discussions regarding safety concerns. 

  The question now is, “Has the SAF learnt from its errors and improved safety in camps?” The short answer is no. The long answer? Well, look no further than January 19th, literally as I was in the middle of writing this.

  On January 19th, actor Aloysius Pang returning to the army for reservist duties, was crushed by an infantry gun barrel, eerily similar to the incident involving Gavin Chan. The SAF has vowed to, you have guessed it, review safety precautions and investigate the incident in a fair and objective manner. Deja vu anyone? 
  
  In the SAF’s troubled history there have been more than 70 NS men deaths, including the most recent one involving Aloysius Pang. In the wake of almost every incident, the SAF’s response has been lukewarm at best and non-existent in some cases. At this point, the deaths have become normalised, mundane and routine and so have their responses. Their pledges to reform have not been fulfilled and the “Don’t ask, don’t tell” culture is still pervasive. The majority of the deaths have also not led to any form of punishment for the commanders involved (at least not publicly). So long as that is the case, the SAF is complicit in these deaths, they are sending people to suffer near death conditions, and a few straight to the guillotine. Mandatory conscription has added to the suffering in the world, and from my selfish perspective, will soon add to my suffering, which is why I support its abolition.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/co323t/ns_bad_change_my_mind/,0.0,['sexism time']

In the 50s our fight wasn't so much pro-democracy as it was anti-colonial. As everyone knows, we didn't even want to be a country of our own, and had independence shoved upon us, after which we had to worship economic progress in order to survive. 

Hypothesis #2: we care more about economic success than democracy and civil freedoms 

So many of the comments from Singaporeans regarding HK have to do with their distaste stemming from how messy and chaotic everything has become. We've never really had to choose between order and democracy, so of course it confounds us when we see people choose to fight for democracy at the expense of order and economic stability. There's almost a sadistic snicker underlying Singaporeans' comments whenever they talk about how HK's economy is tanking because of the protests, how businesses are moving their operations and assets away from HK and into Singapore. 

Hypothesis #3: we care more about economic success within late capitalism than about democratic freedoms.

How are we supposed to understand HK's language of civil disobedience and civic participation when we've never managed to develop a vocabulary for civic participation? We tap ourselves on the back for pRagMatiC rEsiStaNce, thinking that we've developed such a uniquely Singaporean way of making our requests heard (and being okay that it takes bloody forever) because historical amnesia has been written into our DNA. Dissenters have been painted as anti-country troublemakers in our history textbooks, and we have been programmed to see protests as anti-order and therefore anti-national. Sure, we say we are a democratic nation. But we can't forget that our nation-building happened during a time where you were either democratic or broke because the West was on a campaign to snuff communism out. So embracing democracy could be seen as a way for us to align ourselves to the US and the UK and ensure that we manage to tap on their resources so that their MNCs would come and set up shop and help us industrialize and gain economic success to the dizzying rate that most of our neighbours were only able to dream of.

We've been brought up to see economic success and bureaucratic efficiency as being at the core of what it means for Singapore to be Singapore, and tbh that's just really sad.

297,singapore,192608,How young women are using social media to fight back against men behaving badly,dgscly,underwaternow,1570868543,8,0,,https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/how-young-women-are-using-social-media-fight-back-against-men-behaving-badly,0.0,"[""&gt; # How young women are using social media to fight back against men behaving badly\n\n&gt; SINGAPORE — Elicia Yeo remembers the day that a friend told her that one of her Instagram photos had been shared in a Telegram group chat that had over 40,000 members, mostly men.\n\n&gt; She asked to be added to the Telegram group, called SG Nasi Lemak, to see for herself what was going on in there. What she saw shocked her.\n\n&gt; “There are guys sharing screenshots of girls’ Instagram photos, which other members will make lewd comments on,” said the 19-year-old final-year student from Singapore Polytechnic. “There are also men sharing naked photos and videos of girls, probably without their consent, and even guys offering to sell nudes or explicit videos of their exes, which I think is really sick.”\n\n&gt; One of her first instincts was to turn to Twitter, where she saw that many other young women had been in her shoes and complained about SG Nasi Lemak too.\n\n&gt; She began interacting with some of these women, and tagged the Singapore Police Force in a tweet which included screenshots of the Telegram group chat. Many of her fellow victims did the same.\n\n&gt; She finally lodged a police report at the end of September, over a month after she first found out about the group. Earlier this month, the police said they had received reports against the SG Nasi Lemak chat group, and that investigations were ongoing.\n\n&gt; Throughout the ordeal, social media was a big help, Ms Yeo said. Using Twitter, the young women and girls whose photos had been shared on SG Nasi Lemak could easily tag and notify the police about their frustrations, which she believes will help put pressure on the police to do something.\n\n&gt; Indeed, many young women around the world, inspired by the #MeToo movement that went viral two years ago, are turning to social media as their first resort when they find themselves in similar, or worse, predicaments.\n\n&gt; The most famous example in Singapore, of course, is 23-year-old National University of Singapore (NUS) undergraduate Monica Baey, whose Instagram stories about being the victim of a voyeur not only went viral but sparked a national discussion, prompted local universities to tighten their disciplinary frameworks and received an airing in Parliament.\n\n&gt; But Ms Baey is far from a rarity. TODAY spoke to 10 young social media users, all in their early 20s, who said they come across one or two Instagram stories or tweets each month in which a young woman is exposing a man for bad behaviour, whether it is harassment, molest or circulating their photos without consent.\n\n&gt; Aside from Ms Yeo, TODAY also spoke to two other young women who have turned to social media to put their harassers on blast.\n\n&gt; USING SOCIAL MEDIA TO WARN OTHER WOMEN\n\n&gt; One such young woman, who only wished to be known as CY, also found out that her Instagram pictures had been shared in a Telegram group chat, similar to SG Nasi Lemak, by a man whom she had initially trusted as a friend.\n\n&gt; The 21-year-old said: “I got to know him in secondary school. He seemed really nice at first when he talked to me, which was in 2014 or 2015. We lost touch after graduating, until I was informed that he had taken screenshots of my Instagram and Telegram profile pictures and sent them into such Telegram porn group chats.”\n\n&gt; CY then posted the man’s pictures, name and other identifying details on her Instagram account, and recounted what he had done, as a “warning” to other girls.\n\n&gt; “I have yet to lodge a police report because those pictures (that he shared) were not nudes or anything of that sort, so I think authorities might not be able to do much,” she said.\n\n&gt; In July this year, a 19-year-old Temasek Polytechnic student, who only wanted to be known as Ms Tan, posted on her Instagram account a picture of a man, without revealing his face or identity, being questioned by two police officers inside a handicapped toilet.\n\n&gt; She and a friend had been using the toilet when the man tried to force the door open, she wrote in the caption.\n\n&gt; “At that point in time, we just wanted people to know (what happened). I feel like the police will do what they can, but on Instagram there is more coverage,” she told TODAY.\n\n&gt; “The post was also an outlet (to talk about what I experienced). I couldn’t stop thinking about the incident. I wanted to share my story and let people know that this kind of thing does happen.”\n\n&gt; People certainly took notice — her picture garnered over 21,000 likes almost a month after it was posted on her Instagram.\n\n&gt; She said that being able to post about the incident on Instagram also helped her to cope with the incident.\n\n&gt; “The response was quite overwhelming and so many people felt so strongly about it — there were a lot of angry comments. It definitely helped me and reassured me that I wasn’t overreacting. I felt like my feelings were validated,” she said.\n\n&gt; A POSITIVE TREND?\n\n&gt; Social media users told TODAY that it is common for them to come across Instagram stories or tweets in which victims of sexual harassment and assault are calling out their perpetrators.\n\n&gt; The 10 social media users, all in their early 20s, said that they see one or two such posts every month, and they think this trend is a positive one.\n\n&gt; Final-year NUS student Melissa Chua, 23, said: “If the purpose is to bring about awareness regarding this issue to potential victims out there, then it is a positive and effective way to get the message across.”\n\n&gt; Tattoo artist Rickie Sonjia Marcus, 22, added: “I think it's good that the victims have enough courage to come out and say that that happened to them as it is not easy. However if they really wanted to make a change, I think they should make a police report.”\n\n&gt; Others, however, said they were concerned that some of these young women might end up in trouble themselves, for doxxing.\n\n&gt; Under laws that were introduced in May, doxxing — the publication of an individual’s personal information with intention to harass — is a crime.\n\n&gt; Those found guilty of intentionally causing harassment, alarm or distress can be fined up to S$5,000 or be jailed up to six months, or both. Those found guilty of creating fear or provocation of violence can be fined up to S$5,000 or be jailed up to 12 months, or both.\n\n&gt; Nanyang Technological University undergraduate Theodore Tan, 23, said: “Women voicing out their experiences in a constructive manner is definitely a positive trend. But to dox someone’s identity online is a whole other issue that should be rectified as the motivations behind it should be questioned.”\n\n&gt; WHAT LAWYERS SAY\n\n&gt; Mr Chooi Jing Yen, a lawyer at Eugene Thuraisingam LLP, said that a key requirement for doxxing is an intention to cause harassment, distress or alarm.\n\n&gt; He said: “The pure act of publishing identifying information, without more, would probably not fall foul of the law. Unless, of course, the intention behind doing so was to cause harassment, distress or alarm to the person whose details have been published.”\n\n&gt; If it is a genuine case of a victim intending to call out a perpetrator and warn others to be careful, this probably would not be caught by the laws, he added.\n\n&gt; “There can, however, be a fine line between a genuine intention to warn others and a nascent intention to harass or incite potential violence.”\n\n&gt; However, Mr Joel Ng, a lawyer at Quahe Woo and Palmer LLC, warned that even if the original caption does not explicitly encourage others to threaten or harass, doxxing can still occur.\n\n&gt; He said: “For example, if threats of violence are being made in the comment section, replying to those comments with a person’s personal information could be considered an offence because the poster would have reasonable cause to believe that this is likely to cause violence against that person.”\xa0\n\n&gt; He added that using social media may not be the best way to handle such cases of sexual harassment or assault.\n\n&gt; Mr Ng said: “Any call-out of an alleged perpetrator inherently carries the risk of infringement of the law because it may be inferred that the intention was to harass.\n\n&gt; “There will be no infringement of the law where it is clear that the complainant’s intention was not to harass, such as where the intention was clearly to warn others and where no personal information of the alleged perpetrator is posted.”\n\n&gt; Mr Chooi added that those in the SG Nasi Lemak Telegram chat group are probably running afoul of Singapore’s doxxing laws, but a woman retaliating online might get into trouble as well.\n\n&gt; He said: “We should be alive to the possibility of victims engaging in tit-for-tat behaviour, which the law generally does not encourage. The Singapore courts take a dim view of vigilante justice, and on one view the new laws may be seen as a message from Parliament that such behaviour is not encouraged.”\n\n&gt; He said that victims of sexual harassment or assault may seek orders in court that the perpetrator take down the posts, undertake to refrain from repeating their actions and issue an apology on the same medium.\n\n&gt; \n\n---\n1.0.1 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)""]"

The current maximum fines range from $2,000 to $10,000 for a first conviction, and $10,000 to $15,000 for repeat offenders.The enhanced penalties for repeat offenders will be applied to all prostitution-related offences under the Women’s Charter, said the MHA.\n\n&gt; “This is to deter re-offending across the board, as heavier penalties for repeat offenders currently only apply to selected offences, and do not apply to some roles in the vice syndicates,” the ministry added.\n\n&gt; As syndicates “evolve and use online platforms to advertise and solicit for clients”, they have also moved their vice operations from “traditional red-light districts into residential areas”, said the MHA.\n\n&gt; “This has caused significant disamenities for residents, with the presence of unsavoury characters in our neighbourhoods, and affecting the residents’ sense of safety and security. This has to be dealt with,” it added.\n\n&gt; The proposed amendments will, therefore, include “strengthening the ability” to clamp down on homeowners and tenants who let out their premises for vice activities.\n\n&gt; If vice activities are detected at their premises, homeowners and tenants will have to show that they had no knowledge of and could not, with “reasonable diligence”, have known that the place would be used for vice activities, said the MHA.\n\n&gt; The ministry has advised homeowners to conduct identity checks at the point of signing their lease agreements, as part of “due diligence”, a similar practice currently required under the Immigration Act, where homeowners must conduct identity checks to ensure that persons staying in their premises are not immigration offenders.\n\n&gt; The MHA will be partnering the Council for Estate Agencies (CEA), property agencies and agents, to assist and advise homeowners and tenants to conduct due diligence checks.\n\n&gt; “Property agents who knowingly assist in renting property for vice could also be liable for criminal prosecution,” stressed the ministry.\n\n&gt; To “remain effective against the changing modus operandi of vice syndicates”, another proposed amendment to Section 140(1)(d) is to remove the condition for a woman or girl to have been “procured” for prostitution before an offence is made out.\n\n&gt; “This will allow the Police to take action against any person who brings a woman or girl into Singapore for prostitution, even if she is a freelance sex worker,” said the MHA.More Singapore stories:PMDs may be banned if users' behaviour does not improve, says Janil Puthucheary\n\n&gt; Scrapped Yale-NUS course on dissent had partisan 'motives and objectives': Ong Ye Kung\n\n---\n1.0.1 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)""]"

It is therefore important that the community continues to prevent and remove mosquito breeding habitats, so that fewer male Wolbachia-Aedes mosquitoes have to be released for the technology to be successful,"" said the NEA.\n\n&gt; If successful, the Wolbachia technology will form part of Singapore\'s dengue control programme, alongside existing methods such as comprehensive mosquito surveillance, eradicating mosquito breeding habitats, and spraying insecticide where necessary to control the adult mosquito population.\n\n---\n1.0.1 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"
300,singapore,191142,//RANT STORY// Entitled millennial on MRT,dcps1k,nazedarou,1570103470,4,2,"Let me preface this story by saying that I'm an internet savvy auntie in her 50s, which should explain why I'm on Reddit. So today, while yours truly was making her way home after wet market shopping, little did I know that I was about to meet my arch nemesis. My life was about change in a way where it could be defined in just 2 ways. Before, and after our fated meeting.

I decided to take MRT today instead of the usual bus because, you know, feeling pretty mah especially after getting my hair done yesterday. What can I say? I guess auntie just likes the attention. Quite unlucky today because all my reserved seats taken already, but before I resign myself to my fate I notice a young girl giving auntie the stink eye. TMD who does she think she is? Somemore sitting in my reserved seat. Not sure why she's staring at auntie, but must be because she can't stand having someone else more chio than her in the same train carriage. 

So I did what every other self-respecting auntie would have done and asked for my seat back. Wa, you all should have seen her face after I asked. Actually she still putting on her makeup, but you know ah back in my day where got time to put makeup while on the way to work? Nvm, that is another story for another day. Just when she was about to stand and give it up for auntie (haha loser), the lady next to her offered me her seat. No no no nono, this is not good. I don't want your seat, I want MY seat. I quickly made up some stupid excuse to turn her down, cannot remember already but it was something along the lines of ""young people got more energy so can stand"".

THEN AH, this girl had the gall to talk back to me you know?! I am her senior, I've been through so much more than her. I EARNED my seat on this train. If not for auntie you think still got this nice MRT for you to sit ah? Ok, nevermind!! Youngsters these days not very educated, so auntie shall educate her. I explain to her that this seat is only for old people, injured people and pregnant women. Of course, I make sure to say all this louder so everyone can see what's going on. Clearly I am the one in the right, so what's there to be scared of.

\*\*""HOW YOU KNOW I NOT PREGNANT???!""\*\*

Walaneh this girl actually got some skill. Auntie knows she not pregnant but how to fight that?? Later kena Stomp that's it for auntie's reputation among the senior community in my neighbourhood already. Everyone knows that pregnant trumps senior citizens on our social ranking scale. We older folks need to pave the way for the younger generation (but of course this doesn't apply to guai lan entitled millennials). I decided to call it a day, go home and drown my sorrows watching some K-Drama.

301,singapore,190951,I binged 6 hours of Toggle's The Last Madame cause I support local - Review and TLDR Inside!,dc7oj1,LysanderXonora,1570007403,79,321,"&amp;#x200B;

[Pic from AsiaOne](https://i.redd.it/2z0bk0pag3q31.png)

So I binged watched The Last Madame, the latest Toggle original starring Joanne Peh. Yep - I wanted to support local. Also because Fiona Fussi is a beautiful human. Now having watched all 12 half hour episodes in a row, I felt that I should pen my thoughts and give a condensed review to the SG redditors that aren’t planning to watch it. Cause why not.

Am I film student? A licensed critic? An experienced screenwriter? No x3, I just like films. But I spent 6 hours on a Toggle original, so I am gonna try make my national service of supporting local worth my while. Here goes - ***Toggle execs, I hope you see this.***

**TLDR:** The Last Madame was bad. Cringey bad. 5/10. The best scene in the whole show was the first 3 minutes in the pilot. But I'd rate other MC shows of the same genre 1-3/10 so its definitely a clear grade above the norm.

Now before I get attacked for airing my criticism frivolously, I wanna clarify that I am fully aware a lot of work went into this project, and that all parties involved probably wanted and did their best to see it go well. My criticism today largely covers **screenplay and direction**, not so much on the performances.

TLM was bad TV in comparison to other works out there. However, in spite of that, it did leave me optimistic for the future of Singapore TV, cause it did many things right - more so than many of its predecessors. So I'm keeping an open mind.

# SPOILER ALERT. I tried to condense my thoughts below but if this gets more traction I might make a video going more in depth on my criticism.

**Quick overview:** The Last Madame is told across two arcs. A modern day arc (Fiona’s arc) and a flashback arc (Joanne’s arc). Fiona’s character, Chi Ling, is an investment banker from HK that returned home to SG to sell her great grandma’s (Joanne’s character) shophouse for 17 million (lmao). It is there where she bumps into history buff/pro-bono barber/plantation worker Guo Wen, who tells her that the shophouse belonged to an old Madame (Joanne’s char) of a brothel. Fiona says she’s not interested in his spiel, the guy protests, and they scuffle abit before falling over each other - Kdrama style, all within 40 seconds of meeting. *Sexy.*

So now her ankle is twisted, and plot dictates that she’s forced to sit around and listen to history nerd ramble about the brothel and her great grandma. We are then introduced to the flashback arc for Joanne’s character aka the Madame. The rest of the series goes on with to and fro jumps between past to present. The Madame arc is some weirdly written gang war/murder mystery flick so I’m not gonna harp much on that plot wise.

After the Madame arc concludes, Fiona’s character decides that she needs to ditch that 17 million payout and KEEP the shophouse for herself (cause yknow - traditionz). But she does not have enough money to restore it so she SELLS her stocks in HK. But she still doesn’t have enough so homeboy Guo Wen pulls out the ultimate lifesaver by telling her he actually owns the plantation instead of just working there so he SELLS that too and they get enough money. Oh yea she also falls in love with Guo Wen. Did I mention she was engaged to her boss a week before?

Yep.

# The Good:

\- Editing was pretty solid to my normie eyes. No glaring lighting/conti errors or weird cuts - it was smooth. Fight scenes were painful but I dont think I’ll blame the editor for that.

\- The scene in the pilot before the intro credits. It introduced the theme of the show well with enough intensity and intrigue to pique my interest to say ""oooh not bad"". When they cut to the intro with the gasp, I almost clapped. Sadly, this was the best scene of the entire series for me.

\- Believable integration of singlish and 'proper speak' in the story.

\- Soundtrack. Dope af, loved the intro song (anyone know where it's from?)

\- Joanne Peh’s acting. I think I found her performance the strongest of all the cast members. Fiona’s wasn’t bad as well. Props to Brandon Wong for being very expressive with his rage too. But sadly, everything was ruined by the dialogue - but we’ll get to that later.

\- Sexiness + racy content. The “Joanne nude scene” (episode 9 for the researchers) and other sexy hooker scenes were honestly surprisingly realistic. Even the “semi rape” scene near the end was not the normal messy montage you see on Channel 8, the scene was actually pretty graphic and caught me by surprise. Overall, adult themes in the show were WAY more saucy than anything I’ve ever seen in local tv so it’s really cool to see local productions exploring more controversial topics. This compliment doesn't extend to the dialogue leading up to the sexy times sadly.

\- Small shoutout to Alan Wan's character, Chi Ling's fiance. The handsome dude was actually the most realistic character out there. He behaved exactly how a young investment banker boss would. They wrote him as rich douche, but he turned out to be the best dude and overturned quite a few stereotypes.

# The Bad:

\- Forced themes. I understand that stuff like cultural preservation is a must talk about topic especially if a film is “gov funded” or whatever, but the whole “we must preserve” messaging was REALLY in your face the entire time. Likewise for the underlying feminist themes. It was a tad overdone. It didn’t help that these forced themes were often prioritised over plot and character development.

\- The protagonists. Both Fiona and Joanne’s characters were passive protagonists with unrealistic or unclear goals which made them really unsympathetic characters to follow. (Fiona’s character much more so because her entire arc was low stakes. If she failed, she would sell the house for 17 million and not find out about her great grandmother. Hardly world ending. At least the Madame would have been wrongly accused of murder.)

\- The modern arc was unnecessary. Apart from serving a function to open and close the Madame arc, the entire modern arc could have been axed. What we got was corny channel 5 plot filler nonsense with an unbelievable romance plot woven into it. The only real purpose of the modern arc was exposition. Next point.

\- Chemistry and romance. None of the leads had romantic chemistry with each other, and it made the already terrible story writing and hookups extra unbelievable.  This point is extra sad cause I know Joanne mentioned she wanted to go nude for the show cause it would exhibit the character's inner turmoils and passions better. But that's just it. The characters were so poorly written that none of that served any purpose cause I didn't believe they were infatuated - it was rushed and forced. I think I actually compressed myself into my chair 3-4 times during my watch yelling *""Wtf you're banging??!""*

\- Too many dick jokes. *I'm serious.* I get it, it's a brothel and ya'll nasty gals, but the random dick jokes out of nowhere were super cringe and takes the mood out of serious scenes. :(

\- **Too much exposition.** Characters constantly provided unnecessary exposition in their dialogue, completely disregarding ‘show not tell’. “Oh do you mean we are looking for a spy?” “Are you telling me last night meant nothing?” “Did you know that this gang is the fiercest gang” etc etc. *Maybe* the show was targeted to older folk with slower grasp on plot concepts, but honestly, I dont see my granny watching local brothel drama. She’d be shaking her head so much she’d miss half the show.

# The Ugly:

\- The dialogue. The dialogue in this show was ***horrendous***. Exposition every 4 sentences. Lines that do not sound like what normal people would say. And the seduction lines were ***tear jerking***.

# BUT...

The Last Madame showed that we have the potential. The shell - editing, production quality, soundtrack, acting chops (kinda), was there. But I believe a good screenplay was all that was missing to carry that shell to a respectable level. We are close - I think.

Finally, to answer the age old Singaporean rebuttal to arguments - ‘you so smart you can do better meh?’ :

Yes, I really think I can write a better screenplay than what we got.

There have been several decent pieces on r/Singapore about taking a more pragmatic approach to climate change. The above-mentioned TODAY article masquerades as such a piece with its meta title. Unfortunately, it is in fact a fallacious, poorly researched piece with the underlying agenda of promoting free-market forces as the solution to climate change.

&gt; What about fossil fuels? While reducing our economy’s dependence on fossil fuels is a worthy goal to pursue, one must be careful of the transition costs of doing so, especially for developing nations which **cannot afford expensive renewables**.  
&gt;
&gt; Billions of people around the world, trapped in poor countries, have no access to cheap energy. That means no electricity to keep warm, to cook and to live decently. They die from indoor air pollution due to energy poverty. Enforcing a reduction of fossil fuels would further worsen their plight.  
&gt;
&gt; Renewable energy still makes up a small proportion of the world’s energy output, and **before it comes widely cost-effective**, fossil fuels are still the best bet for the growth prospects of poor nations. We should not prolong poverty simply because first-world environmental activists can afford renewables.

The claim that renewables are *expensive* is inaccurate. Renewable energy is cost effective for upcoming projects. From [Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2018](https://www.irena.org/publications/2019/May/Renewable-power-generation-costs-in-2018) by the International Renewable Energy Agency (who ASEAN have an [MOU](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/asean-signs-mou-to-build-partnership-for-sustainable-energy-future-in-south-east-asia) with):

&gt; Continuing cost declines, meanwhile, underline renewable power as a low-cost climate and decarbonisation solution. Within IRENA’s global database, over three-quarters of the onshore wind and four-fifths of the utility-scale solar PV project capacity due to be commissioned in 2020 should provide **lower-priced electricity than the cheapest new coal-fired, oil or natural gas option**, the report notes.

In fact, investors are shying away from opening new coal plants because clean energy is becoming cheaper - related articles:

- ['Coal is on the way out': study finds fossil fuel now pricier than solar or wind - Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/25/coal-more-expensive-wind-solar-us-energy-study)
- [Renewable Energy Costs Take Another Tumble, Making Fossil Fuels Look More Expensive Than Ever - Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2019/05/29/renewable-energy-costs-tumble/#dfe4889e8cea)

&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE?... we should have a sense of proportion.. blaming extreme weather events on climate change, for instance, is far out of proportion. A recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on hurricanes said that there have been “no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century”, suggesting that the incidence of extreme weather is far less than what activists have made it seem. 

In short, because *tropical cyclones* have not worsened over the last century, the author thinks extreme weather shouldn't be blamed on climate change and so climate change isn't as detrimental as some claim.  

This chain of thought has issues.  

For one thing, *tropical cyclone frequency* is not a barometer for extreme weather. By definition, extreme weather includes precipitation patterns, heat waves, flooding and more. Just because *tropical cyclone frequency* hasn't changed, does not mean extreme weather is not an issue. Consider that the July 2019 European heat wave was a period of exceptionally hot weather, setting **all-time** high temperature records in Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.
Singapore's highest recorded temperature is 36.7 °C (98.1 °F) on 13 April **2016**. Also, **annual rainfall total for Singapore since 1980 has increased at an average rate of 97 mm per decade**. Those flash floods we've had over the past decade have not been caused by deterioration in our drainage infrastructure, rather they're the result of changing precipitation patterns. Extreme weather **is** a real and measurable issue today.  

For another, extreme weather over the last century is not what makes climate change dangerous. What makes it
dangerous is extreme weather in the near future. Perhaps the author thinks the last century can be extrapolated, unfortunately, this is another daft notion because green house gas emissions have been accelerating.
For what the professionals think the future holds, consider this excerpt from ""[Goldman Sachs released a 34-page analysis of the impact of climate change. And the results are terrifying.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/goldman-sachs-climate-change-threatens-new-york-tokyo-lagos-cities-2019-9-1028552494)"":

&gt; - More frequent, more intense, and longer-lasting heatwaves. The consequences will affect human health, productivity, economic activity, and agriculture. ""Higher surface temperatures could exacerbate the warming process by causing permafrost to melt, releasing further methane and CO2 into the atmosphere.""
&gt; - Destructive weather events, including storms, winds, flooding and fires. It's not just New York, Tokyo and Lagos. ""Other major low-lying coastal or already flood-prone cities include Shanghai, Dhaka, Mumbai and Karachi – each of which has a population of 15 million people or more.""
&gt; - Changing disease patterns. ""Warmer temperatures could cause disease vectors to migrate from the tropics to regions where people have less immunity; this is true not only for viruses like malaria and dengue fever but also for water-borne and food-borne diseases.""
&gt; - Shifting agricultural patterns and food shortages. ""Livestock could be affected by higher temperatures and reduced water supplies. Ocean acidification is likely to put stress on aquatic populations and affect current fishing patterns. Some of these changes are already underway. Some climate scientists, for example, estimate that coral reefs will be all but extinct over the course of the century due to ocean acidification.""
&gt; - Water. ""Half of the world's population will live in water-stressed areas as soon as 2025,"" Goldman notes, citing the World Health Orgnization. ""Even in non-stressed areas, the quality of surface water could deteriorate as more rain and storms drive erosion and the release of toxins. These dynamics could affect everything from the availability of drinking water for people to a shortage of water for livestock and crops (with negative effects for the food supply) to decreases in hydroelectric power generation.""

&amp;nbsp;  

The author goes on to assert that because direct deaths from extreme weather events has fallen, climate change is being blown out of proportion:

&gt; Additionally, what is important is not just the incidence of extreme weather events, but their human impact. On this note, research by Indur Goklany has shown that human mortality by **extreme weather events** has fallen by 98 per cent over the past century

This is yet another unusual argument. Sure, with the improved structural integrity of buildings, you're less likely to die in a hurricane. But that is not what people are worried about: we're worried about indirect effects of changing weather patterns and non-fatal costs - you may not die but the consequences of climate change affect your well-being. PM Lee puts it succinctly:

&gt; “The consequences of climate change are catastrophic and affect all countries. New diseases, more extreme weather events, food shortages, forced migration and even wars,” - PM Lee  

To conclude that climate change is ""overblown"" just because there have been fewer direct deaths from hurricanes and floods belies a serious cognitive deficiency, to say the least.  

The author thinks the free market is a magic pill that will solve all things, including climate change. Unfortunately, there are situations where the free market just doesn't work. Consider the USA's medical industry, or Hong Kong's housing industry.
Why does the free market fail sometimes? The issue is that individual interests aren't always aligned with those of the collective - a drug maker may decide against curing a chronic illness to maximize profits from symptom alleviating medication for the chronic illness, a land baron may hoard land to drive up prices. These actions benefit the drug maker and land baron, but the net cost to society is immense. Fundamentally, individuals tend to take a short term, small-picture outlook.  

Singapore's governments have never shied away from intervening with a firm hand. Just look at our own medical and housing industries. Climate change is yet another area where a firm hand is warranted because of the long term nature of climate change mitigation plans and the hard-to-quantify climate costs of many activities.

311,singapore,197809,Entitled uncle at kopitiam,duavyz,boooooooooiiiiiiii,1573389152,51,1,"I never thought I would post ever need to post this but damn am I mad. Maybe the word entitled is too strong here but i guess this uncle was unreasonable. Anyways here is the story

So if u have ever patronised the kopitiam square at sengkang, you will know how crowded the top-up kiosk gets during lunch/dinner time especially during a weekend. And what is worse is that the queue “format” always changes. Sometimes, people will be queuing from each kiosk and sometimes its just one queue that spilt when u r at kiosk.  This is because the design of which they designed the place to top-up had really no thought put into it. Anyways, ye you get it, its messy and disorganized. 

So today was the “one queue” format and everyone was forming a long queue to wait for their turn to top-up. I was in the queue too with my sister for about 3 mins. Lucky it was still early and the queue length was reasonable. And then, yay it was finally our turn. When it was almost our turn, this random uncle (around his late 50s or early 60s, he was well-abled and able to communicate in english, so i doubt that he was that old or couldnt understand the scenario, sorry i judged him, but dont we all?) came walking from up to the side of the kiosks with his card in hand ready to top-up his card. I saw him look at the queue then the kiosk and i thought, “okay still normal, uk its normal for people to check out how the queue goes” and by now the queue was getting a bit long? Maybe about 10 plus people? Oh but what did he decide to do? You guessed it, cut in front of us... damn

Honestly, i am usually the person that goes... oh just another of those people...  and just let the matter rest, but what happen next shook me and i think everyone there (especially my sister, lets not forget she exist)

After cutting the queue he looked around (obviously guilty), and i made eye contact with him. Normally it stops there, but i swear and i swore i saw a smug on his face (he obviously knew no one dared to speak up) and that just pissed me off.  I wanted to wipe that off his face. So i just said out (in chinese, if that matters), as politely i could, because i really didnt want a conflict with him (ironic), “uncle, everyone is queuing, can u go queue and not cut the queue” then i signaled him to the end of the queue. 

At first, he smiled and i was like “what a nice uncle”. Then he came out the queue “oh damn my faith in Singaporeans have been restored” but he started walking towards me and he tried to reason that he was going for the other kiosk not the one that seemingly everyone was queuing for (i guess he is a fan of the 2 queue format). Then i just said but everyone is queuing to top-up and that there is only one queue (limited to my ability in chinese, which i got a B for in h1 so its not bad but still terrible) so i couldnt argue more. But honestly i was just happy to have him out of the queue he cut and queuing (balance like things should be).

So people moved off during the process, so i took my place at where the uncle went off (ooh, but i queued ok) and then he got real pissed. He then exclaimed “you see, you also like that what?” 

Woah lo and behold salty me turned around and said, “But uncle, I queued”. And he was not happy. He strutted behind me and planted himself there. Then he started saying smthg but i cant really remember what he said. Then at this point i just didnt want to aggravate the scenario cause i needed to get home to study for my a levels tmr (ik im typing this but i’d probably keep having this thought in mind to type it that i cant study, at least this will have me at rest) and i just told him that im sorry that i offended you and that ok if u wanted to just cut lah, u done wrong, i did my best, i really dont want to get into a fist fight, let have matters rest. 

And at that point people around me were like trying to stop it, and ye i took the advice and just ignored him. Oh yes, my sister was still here and she was almost gg to cry, so i decided uk what for the best of everyone, lets just top our cards up and eat our dinner shall we?

Oh but no. Even though i didnt interact with him already be raised 2 very VERY interesting points up to argue with me. 

He said, “how does your school teach you how to queue huh?”
Which i nodded as a reply, im sorry that i am inept in school ok

Then he shouted at me, “they say fight for your rights, so im fighting for mine!” 
I was shook. A part of me wanted to turn around and argue but i just couldnt man. 

Anyways, it ended like this and ye how do you guys feel about this? What would you have done? Were you thr? Did i do wrong? Idk anyways im just here to rant my anger away

314,singapore,196276,Singapore birthrates falling,dqcl6w,fullbloodedwhitemale,1572652417,19,4,"SINGAPORE — Sarah Wee and James Ng are the quintessential career couple. Married only a year, the sparkly Wee is a media executive at a large ad agency. Ng, clean-cut in a blue button-down, is an asset manager with a property investment firm. They own a condo, a $42,000 car and two dogs, a Maltese and a Shih Tzu.

They have a bright future, a future that includes children — but not just yet.

That is the quandary Singapore faces as it tries to boost its anemic birthrate. The government, fearing that the tiny, prosperous city-state will shrink into oblivion, has recently adopted a series of incentives to encourage people to have not just one or two but three or more children.

Officialdom here once rewarded parents who voluntarily sterilized themselves. Now it’s offering three-month paid maternity leaves, up to several thousand dollars in graduated baby bonuses and co-savings plans, and tax breaks for nannies and grandparents who take care of children.

Those incentives may nudge couples such as Wee and Ng. Wee, 28, had been thinking of having one or two babies. But with the new policy, she said, maybe she will have more.

“It seems a bit easier to have children,” she said over dinner at a restaurant in a glittering downtown shopping mall. But, she added, “I don’t want to quit my job and stay at home.”

Singapore’s birthrate has sunk to an all-time low of 1.25 babies per woman. Raising it has become a national cause, as significant as the fight against terrorism. If the birthrate continues to wane, officials warn, the workforce will shrink. There will be fewer people to support a growing elderly population and to sustain the military that protects this 400-square-mile island sandwiched between Indonesia and Malaysia. Singapore’s vaunted tiger economy will whimper.

The government is loosening immigration rules, too. But a premium will always be placed on native-born Singaporean citizens, officials said.

“This is a matter of values, not of incentives,” the new prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, said in a recent National Day speech. “We want people to have babies because you want them and you love them. It’s part of a happy family life. “

“Singapore. A Great Place for Families,” declared a two-page color spread in the Straits Times newspaper promoting the baby perks. The paper also brimmed with articles about new measures to encourage a “balanced family life,” including a shorter workweek for government employees — five days instead of five and a half — and guidelines for ending discrimination against working women who want babies.

A government parenthood hotline has logged about 1,000 calls a day since it was set up last month. A parenthood Web site has drawn about 80,000 hits.

To succeed, the government must remake the social attitudes that come with greater affluence, as well as the resistance to having children that the state itself fostered a generation ago.

In the 1960s, when Singapore had just gained its independence from Britain, having six children was common. In the 1970s, worried that the population was growing too fast, the government began a “Stop At Two” policy, using tax and other incentives to curb family growth.

The birthrate started to drop, mainly among educated women.

Realizing the birth pattern was becoming socially lopsided, the government reversed itself, trying to encourage educated women to have more babies. But by 1987, the overall birthrate was still falling, so the state introduced its “Have three or more if you can afford it” policy and, more recently, cash bonuses for second and third babies. But births continued to dwindle.

A major reason for the decline, sociologists and doctors say, is stress. Singaporeans are so focused on work that they have less sex than people in other countries and therefore fewer babies, said Victor Goh, an obstetrician and fertility expert at National University Hospital who conducted a study on sexual habits in 2002.

The Equatorial Spitting Cobra is perhaps the most dangerous of our venomous snakes, since it is commonly encountered living in more urban areas close to people.

It has a wide distribution that spans across much of tropical Asia, from the southwest,  northern and eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent, to southern China, Indochina, and Thailand, the Andaman Islands, and south to Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, the Greater Sundas (Sumatra, Borneo, Java), all the way to Bali, Sulawesi, and the Philippines. While only a single species of King Cobra is recognised for now, there is some geographical variation in physical appearance. It is possible that future research will discover that what we now call the King Cobra may actually be made up of several different species. Although the King Cobra and the so-called 'true' cobras (members of the genus *Naja*) belong to the same family (called Elapidae), they are not each other's closest relatives. Instead, the King Cobra is more closely related to the African mambas (which include the Black Mamba, another snake with a deadly reputation). 

With a recorded maximum length of 5.85 metres, the King Cobra is the world's longest venomous snake. In Singapore, only the Reticulated Python exceeds it in size. Like the smaller cobras, it rears up and expands its hood to face a potential threat, but its hood is narrower and lacks the markings seen in some Asian species of cobra. The key difference though is height; it is said that a large King Cobra is able to rear up as high as a person's chest, and look them in the eye. And while many snakes will hiss loudly to warn predators to back off, the King Cobra's warning hiss is often described as more like a [low menacing growl]( https://youtu.be/_2EIQdbOqt0). Certainly, coming face to face with a King Cobra, especially one [actively trying to defend itself](https://youtu.be/SCNJiXnYBVI), must be a most intimidating experience.

This threatening display is not an act. Like other elapids, the King Cobra has a pair of hollow fangs which are located at the front of its upper jaw, functioning like hypodermic needles. When it strikes, venom is pumped out of glands located at the back of the head, flows through these fangs, and is injected into the bite wound. The King Cobra packs a deadly punch, with venom full of neurotoxins that target the nervous system and heart. While its venom is not as deadly as that produced by several other snake species, it more than makes up for it in terms of the sheer volume of venom injected. A single bite can kill a human within half an hour, and even fell elephants.

**A meal fit for a king**

However, the King Cobra uses its venom mostly to subdue its prey, which consists almost entirely of [other snakes](https://youtu.be/zcuXzUryEdY). When prey is encountered, the King Cobra [sinks its fangs into its victim](https://youtu.be/h7LuBIsMPOI?t=77), often behind the back of the head, and clamps down hard. As the prey struggles, both snakes may end up getting entwined together. Defensive bites from prey don't seem to faze it at all. The venom contains neurotoxins that work on the central nervous system, stopping the heart and paralysing muscles, and the lungs cease functioning. Prey eventually succumbs and suffocates. The King Cobra then slowly swallows it whole, usually headfirst. In fact, *Ophiophagus*, which is the genus name given to the King Cobra, translates to ""snake-eater"" in Greek, *ophio*- meaning ""snake"" and -*phagus* meaning ""to eat"". It is a very apt description of this species, which is [known to be cannibalistic]( https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2019/01/sbr2019-048-049.pdf). Even smaller yet also highly venomous snakes like [cobras](https://youtu.be/mUgAhS9e-mM) and [vipers](https://youtu.be/gBIU8vr_hPw) are no match for the king – it's been found to have evolved resistance to the venoms of its potential prey.

Even the largest snakes in the jungle are not immune to predation by the King Cobra; it will readily go for pythons, although it is obviously limited to smaller individuals. There were two fairly recent eyewitness accounts of King Cobras going after smaller Reticulated Pythons in Singapore – one took place [next to a road in NTU campus]( https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/python-versus-king-cobra-in-a-battle-at-ntu-campus) in August 2015 (albeit close to the forest edge), while the other was [along the MacRitchie Nature Trail]( https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/python-v-cobra-round-2-snakes-do-battle-at-macritchie-trail) in May 2017. These encounters must be an awesome spectacle to behold; two of the largest snakes of Southeast Asia in combat, venom against constricting coils. Things don't always go the King Cobra's way though; if the python manages to fight back, the predator might find itself fighting for its own life, which appears to be what happened at NTU; the Reticulated Python, despite being smaller, managed to throw a coil around the King Cobra's neck, and [the latter snake was struggling](https://youtu.be/yESGnieUGfY), presumably waiting for the venom to take hold and incapacitate its prey. A [more recent photo]( https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/02/king-cobra-reticulated-python-fight-battle-photo-spd/) of unknown provenance has made its rounds online, depicting a King Cobra and a Reticulated Python, both dead – the King Cobra likely successfully envenomated the python, but the python managed to coil around and constrict the cobra before succumbing.

Besides snakes, the King Cobra is also known to feed on monitor lizards. There is a video from January 2016 of one [swallowing a young Malayan Water Monitor](https://mothership.sg/2016/01/sungei-buloh-king-cobra-blocks-hikers-path-devours-monitor-lizard/) in Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. Birds and rodents have also been recorded as prey, although there are very few such records.

**Royal Families**

Reproduction in King Cobras seems rather straightforward at first; we know that the species is oviparous (egg-laying). However, there are some very interesting behaviours that make it stand out from other snakes.

Like many other snakes, male King Cobras will [engage in ritualised combat](https://youtu.be/m96Zt3zDssg), rearing up and attempting to pin each other to the ground. This sparring allows rival males to show off their strength and establish dominance while avoiding the use of venom.

Courtship and mating can be a risky affair, especially since King Cobras routinely eat other snakes, and males typically grow larger than females. Receptive females leave a scent trail that put the males in the mood for sex instead of food, and he may pursue her through the forest for hours. Once he's caught up, and if she is slow to accept, he may headbutt her repeatedly until she relents. Mating lasts for up to an hour.

The female king cobra also does something that has not been observed in any other snake species; she [actively builds a nest](http://pogirigowrishankar.wordpress.com/2011/04/24/king-cobra-nests/) for her eggs, using her body and tail to gather leaves and other debris to create a large mound. Fallen leaves of bamboo are favoured, and King Cobra nests are often located close to or even in bamboo clumps. Within this nest, temperature and humidity remain constant, providing suitable conditions for the growth and development of the babies.

Once she has laid her eggs, the mother King Cobra will remain near the nest, fending off potential predators. A devoted mother, she guards the nest for two to three months while the eggs incubate, fasting and living off her reserves. Only when the eggs are about to hatch does she leave the nest, probably to avoid triggering her predatory response and instinctively eating her own young.

Baby King Cobras, which measure up to 60 centimetres in length when they first emerge, are unlike their parents with [their conspicuous coloration](https://flic.kr/p/2fvSVQX): black with narrow white or yellow bands. Without the protection of their mother, they are vulnerable to all sorts of predators, which may even include adults of the same species. However, one thing they share in common with the adults is that even at such a young age, their venom is already just as potent and deadly.

**The King Cobra in Singapore**

Although the King Cobra is usually thought of as being restricted to forests, it is quite adaptable and will live near people. In other parts of its range, the King Cobra may be found in rice paddies and farmland, in plantations, and even near villages, as long as there is enough vegetation cover, or nearby forest. In fact, such places may even ultimately attract King Cobras; since rodents are abundant in agricultural areas and wherever people live, snakes that eat rats are lured by the prospects of good feeding opportunities, which in turn provide a rich hunting ground for the King Cobra. King Cobras can even be found in forest patches near densely-populated urban areas. For example, the species still survives in parts of Hong Kong.

In mainland Singapore, the King Cobra is mostly restricted to forests, woodlands, and mangroves, although they are occasionally encountered in more developed areas. One stronghold is the Central Catchment Nature Reserve; a number of records have taken place in the vicinity of Rifle Range Road, MacRitchie Reservoir, and Upper Thomson. One male measuring 4.42 metres in length was found at the Singapore Island Country Club along Island Club Road in June 2002, but sadly, was beaten to death. That individual is now on display in the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. They have also been seen in condominiums and military camps located at the forest fringes.

Wild King Cobras are quite frequently encountered within the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, sometimes even in broad daylight in front of visitors. King Cobras have also been seen at Bukit Panjang on at least two occasions; one was a juvenile about 60 centimetres long, found in the Segar area in March 2000, while the other measured 2 metres long, and was seen in a drain near Bukit Panjang Plaza. Both individuals were caught and sent to the Singapore Zoo. Oddly, the King Cobra has yet to be recorded from the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, although it is likely to be present there.

Another stronghold for the King Cobra is in the west of Singapore, encompassing the Western Catchment, Jalan Bahar, Lim Chu Kang, and Kranji areas. There have been quite a number of sightings of this species at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve in recent years.

The species is also present on Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong. Interestingly, an adult was even encountered somewhere in Sentosa in May 2007. More records of this species in Singapore can be found [in this paper published in 2011](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/06/2011nis143-156.pdf).

Despite the King Cobra's size and deadly venom, it is not an aggressive snake by nature; even though it is not uncommon in many parts of its range and can be found living close to people, reports of bites are rare in comparison to those of other venomous snakes. Yes, its bite should never be taken lightly, but as a whole, it seems like these snakes possess a relatively mild temperament and placid disposition. Some accounts describing the capture of King Cobras apparently indicate that the snake did not attempt to strike even when it had every opportunity to do so; instead these individuals appeared to be more intent on trying to escape, deploying its threat display without following up on the threat with its fangs. Still, there have been instances where the King Cobra does mean business and strikes, with dire consequences. 

The King Cobra can be considered to be one of the more charismatic snakes; it's large, it has a fearsome reputation (not just because it's highly venomous, but also because it routinely eats other snakes), and as many people who have been close to one can testify, is a really unique snake. Filmmaker Janaki Lenin, who worked on a National Geographic documentary about the King Cobra, wrote:

&gt; There's something uncanny about the way a king cobra looks you in the eye. It's an indescribable feeling, an encounter with a sentient being. It's about making contact with an entity so utterly different from anything one knows and normally relates to. Keepers say that when they open the door to the king cobra cage, the snake is so perceptive of what's going on; it knows whether the keeper is planning to feed it or whether he is just checking up on it. But it is its majestic restraint that reveals its personality. For the 6 months it took to shoot the film, we were all in such close proximity to king cobras I marvel that no accident took place. And this is more due to the tolerance of the snake than anything else. The more closely we work with an animal, the more we take it for granted. We flaunted our own security protocol several times; each time the king cobra just warned us, mock charging but never carrying it through. This made us respect the creature more than any other.

There are a number of accounts which state that King Cobras come across as being very alert, observant, and perceptive. And some people have stated that King Cobras recognise people, and can be trained to some degree. But it’s still important to remember that these are still [potentially deadly animals](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1995-08-27-9509130317-story.html); sadly, quite a number of King Cobra bites involve people that were deliberately handling the snake, such as snake charmers and [reptile hobbyists](https://youtu.be/xBQgffr3Jdc). All it takes is a moment of carelessness and bad luck, and a person with years of experience with handling highly venomous snakes could still end up in a life-threatening situation.

In Singapore, the King Cobra's survival depends on the continued protection of its habitats. Conflict with people is a major issue; a snake wandering into more urbanised areas risks getting seriously hurt by frightened humans, or even killed. The roads that run alongside many of our forests present another hazard; some of the sightings of this species were of roadkills. Deforestation, conflict with humans, and hunting are also threats to wild populations of King Cobras elsewhere, but exploitation for the tourist trade also seriously threatens the species in some places. 

The King Cobra is often revered to some degree and involved in snake charming performances. However, some snake charmers are known to render their potentially deadly captives harmless, either by pulling out the fangs, or stitching the snakes' mouths shut.

King Cobras are among several species of snakes raised on so-called snake farms in several neighbouring countries in the region, such as Thailand and Vietnam. Some farms raise snakes for meat, skins, and traditional medicines, while others operate under the guise of extracting venom for research and production of antivenom. Many of these farms, as well as too many awful zoos, are marketed as tourist attractions, and incorporate shows featuring King Cobras and other snakes being provoked and prodded for gawking visitors. Many captive snakes might not be kept under suitable conditions, or catch diseases and parasites, slowly wasting away and eventually dying while being made to perform for gawking crowds. Sometimes the snakes are taxidermised, or drowned and immersed in jars of rice wine to be sold to tourists. It's not always clear whether these King Cobras were bred in captivity, or wild-caught; it's likely that a lot of these organisations simply capture more King Cobras from the wild to replace those that die. Due to the decline in wild populations in many parts of its range, the King Cobra is considered globally vulnerable to extinction.

In many ways, the plight of the King Cobra illustrates the common challenges of conserving large predators: this species is constrained by ever-shrinking forests and encroachment, and individuals wander into inhabited areas where they come into conflict with people. It is hunted and consumed for meat, and is also used in traditional medicines. Captives are often exploited, kept in substandard conditions, abused and subjected to the stress of performing for people. Yet at the same time, it is respected and revered by some of these very same cultures. If there is another iconic predator of the Asian forests that shares the very same problems faced by the King Cobra, it is the Tiger.

As of Nov 21, more than 14,470 people here had been infected with the disease, with 20 lives lost.\n\n&gt; The new facility will allow the National Environment Agency (NEA) to scale up Project Wolbachia by producing up to five million mosquitoes a week.\n\n&gt; The project involves the release of male Wolbachia-Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to suppress the urban Aedes aegypti mosquito population, which is the primary vector of dengue, chikungunya and Zika here.\n\n&gt; When the released male Wolbachia-Aedes aegypti mosquitoes mate with urban female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that do not carry Wolbachia, the resulting eggs do not hatch.\n\n&gt; The NEA said that over time, the continued release of male Wolbachia-Aedes aegypti mosquitoes is expected to bring about a gradual reduction in the urban Aedes aegypti mosquito population, and hence lower the risk of dengue transmission.\n\n&gt; Speaking at the launch of the new facility, Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources Amy Khor said: ""If we are serious about confronting climate change and other challenges, dengue control cannot simply be just \'business as usual\'. We cannot just do more of the same.""\n\n&gt; Explaining the need for action, Dr Khor, who is also Senior Minister of State for Health, said the dengue situation is likely to worsen over the next few decades as a result of global warming.\n\n&gt; This is because higher temperatures result in mosquitoes breeding faster, and cause the dengue virus to replicate at a quicker rate.\n\n&gt; Related Story NEA to test releasing mosquitoes via drone as Project Wolbachia moves to phase 4 of fight against dengue\n\n&gt; Related Story Mosquito trials raise hopes of defeating dengue\n\n&gt; The new $5 million facility in Techplace II at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5 is expected to provide scalability in the production and release of Wolbachia-Aedes aegypti mosquitoes needed for Project Wolbachia.\n\n&gt; NEA chief executive Tan Meng Dui said the facility\'s target capacity a week is a tenfold increase over that of the previous facility, which was located in Neythal Road and is now defunct.\n\n&gt; ""This facility and the technologies it houses will play a key role in Singapore\'s efforts to deploy Wolbachia technology as part of our integrated vector control programme to tackle these diseases (dengue, chikungunya and Zika),"" he added.\n\n&gt; The highly automated facility in Ang Mo Kio, which is thrice the size of the previous one, incorporates new technology and machines to boost production capacity and increase productivity, including a male-female pupae sorter, which was co-developed by NEA and local start-up Orinno Technology.\n\n&gt; The sorter is 10 to 20 times faster than the previous method used to separate the two types of pupae and larvae, and uses lighting, water-flow control and a specially designed sieve to achieve high accuracy and high efficiency in the separation process.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; The highly automated facility in Ang Mo Kio incorporates new technology and machines, including a male-female pupae sorter, which was co-developed by the National Environment Agency and local start-up Orinno Technology.

Argument heated up, and I saw A put his slingbag down on a nearby bench and move to punch B. Don't recall clearly but have a vague impression that B was turning away and A struck him unawares. 

Short scuffle ensued, blows were traded. B's spectacles broke. During a short cessation, B spoke to A, saying, ""Walk away lah"", and A replied, ""You want to fight right?"" B walked away shortly after, while A taunted him with calls of ""Pussy"", and ""No balls"".

333,singapore,0,"Calling out The Saber Authority, a lightsaber duelling group in SG that claims to teach practical fighting techniques. That's bullshit and you know it.",7plc03,the_rumblebee,1515641984,195,342,"For those who are unfamiliar with [The Saber Authority](https://www.thesaberauthority.com/), they are a group that has gained a considerable amount of fame for teaching saber dueling (they can't say lightsaber because of the copyright I suppose) here in Singapore. They advertise quite a lot on Facebook, and one of their videos has 4 million views on Youtube.

That's not what I have a problem with. The issue is their marketing material and website make multiple mentions that what they teach is not just fantasy, but actual combat techniques. Here are some extracts from their website:

&gt;We teach only real techniques that can be used in real life self-defense situations. We don't believe in fictional styles or choreographed combat.

&gt;The Combat Saber System is based on actual combat blade fighting, therefore grading is strict, and the skills needed for masteries are real.

A testimonial on their site from a student shows that the apprentices buy into the bullshit. 

&gt;I joined because the combat system is solid and battle-proven. There is no bullshit here. It's simple enough for beginner to try and yet vast and complicated to master.

So this is the easy part of my call-out: proving that it's bullshit.

I can't believe I have to say this, but lightsabers are weapons from fantasy. Taking what you see on the silver screen and adopting it for real-life combat is just about the easiest way to get your ass kicked. Consider [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH24gQ8vUoc) video. Can you imagine any of that hurting you? Lightsabers in the movies focus on quick movements more than heavy attacks, because lightsabers only really need contact to cut. In real life, you need to do more than just swing your arm around to hurt someone. You need to generate proper momentum and put your weight behind your strikes to deal actual damage.

Let's look at a ""combat"" [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smSAnaDaSjY). Lots of needless flailing of the weapon, sure it looks cool but it serves zero practical purpose. Lots of empty pointless footwork that only serves to tire you out. 

Here's [one more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdjyONn1wiw), of their seniors training. They don't actually seem interested in hitting one another in vital spots, again they seem to more actively target each other's weapons. When sparring in real martial arts, we are taught to strike with the intention to hit, without putting power behind our attacks. However, none of the strikes I've seen from any of their videos look remotely dangerous. I assume the reason is because the lightsabers are kids toys that are not meant to withstand real impact. They would probably snap like twigs when used as a weapon.

Lastly, I would like to make comparisons to other weapon-based martial arts. Practitioners of Kendo and Fencing wear protective gear. At TSA, most of them use no protective gear, and at most use a helmet and wrist guards. It's obvious that they don't need protection because they aren't in danger of hurting anyone. But for a martial art that teaches ""real techniques"", why are you in zero danger of getting hurt? 

A Kendo or Fencing match looks incredibly different from the duels at TSA. True masters patiently wait for an opening to strike or counter, while maintaining proper spacing from the enemy. TSA duelists seem more interested in looking cool, all while the instructor yells ""power, power"" out repeatedly, probably reminding them not to hurt each other. Real combat, indeed.

So why is this a big deal? Because **it is dangerous to say you are teaching practical martial arts, when you're not.** You're giving your students fighting confidence that is vastly disproportionate to their actual abilities. If they get into an actual fight they could be seriously hurt, or even killed. 

If you suck at fighting and you know you suck, chances are you will do the smart thing during a confrontation, and run. If you suck at fighting but think you're awesome, you might actually take a crack at it, and end up seriously hurt.

So I'm calling out TSA to say, please stop advertising what you're doing as a practical self-defense. If you want to have fun with lightsabers and invent your own rules for dueling, that's totally fine. But don't package it as a real practical fighting techniques. Because what you're doing is closer to LARPing than actual martial arts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/7plc03/calling_out_the_saber_authority_a_lightsaber/,0.0,['I find your lack of faith..............disturbing.']

So I would like to initiate a conversation, from a girl’s perspective. 

I try to follow discussions on NS closely but until now I have trouble understanding what you guys are expecting from us with regard to this issue. It seems like people are angry at different issues and want different outcomes. 

1. You want a discussion:  Okay, but if anyone offers an alternative viewpoint, or plays the devil’s advocate, I see a strong knee jerk reaction from men and then discussions start getting shallow/ personal very fast. 

2. You want NS to be compulsory for women too: That’s like saying ‘I have cancer and I think it’s unfair. Everyone else should also have cancer so they don’t have an unfair advantage and can also empathise with me’. Instead of a sabo culture, why not fight for NS to not be compulsory for anybody at all? 

3. You want women to stop saying things like ‘NS is easy’ or downplaying its difficulty, or just being a hypocrite. I think that’s acceptable and if any girl is doing that she probably doesn’t have very high eq lol 

4. You think woman get to start working earlier and also earn more since they don’t waste any years: personally, I don’t want to start working so early anyway. We’re gonna be working for the rest of our lives. The grass is always greener on the other side. I also don’t care if I’m earning more or less than my male counterparts, because in the end my partner and I will be sharing all the costs for our families anyway. Will he scold me for earning more or will I hate him for earning less? No. 

5. You’re actually just angry at the Govt only but would like women to speak up: I’m not sure how I’m supposed to go about doing this. What channels are available for feedback like this? What feedback am I supposed to give anyway? Apart from shouting ‘gender equality!!!’ Which everyone has done by now already to no avail. The Govt has their own agenda anyway.

341,singapore,0,"Fellow fans, nerds, hardcore fans and long time watchers okto, I need help locating a show I've watched a long time ago...",7x1bfy,RRB-RogueRoastBeef,1518448028,10,6,"Prologue:

The show I'm looking for is an anime. It aired quite a couple of episodes on Okto about a decade ago, but despite only watching only two episodes, its artistic approach has left me a deep impression in me, and I'm determined to rediscover it after it hit me back like nostalgia.


What I know:

- Overview

From what I can recall, the anime is about this girl, who is under the guardianship of some mysterious gentleman, who is presumably her step-father. If i can remember correctly her outfit resembles that of a steam punk mechanic.


The girl lives in this fantasy world which is kind of vibrant and a meltpot of strange and wonderful spiritual creatures mixed in with the humans. She in some ways makes a living or so by racing in this track where it's full of traps meant to destroy whatever flies through. Yes, the race she takes part in is somewhat similar to pod racing from star wars, but with booby traps ranging, unfair racers and it even attracts strange beings (More on that later).


-Episodes I can remember

1. The first episode I can remember watching involves the girl getting his boyfriend or some sort to challenged a group of frog like creatures to a race through the track. The duo's vehicle is this giant flying machine or some sort that has two arms extending out. The girl gets into the cockpit, which is in the middle of the machine while his boyfriend in one of the ball torrents or some sort in one arm.


The frogs one the other hand have this flying steampunk submarine like airship that is just slow, rusty and not even worth a fight with the girl's flying machine. However, the frogs (Spoiler!) happens to be cheaters themselves, as some of their own kinds are actually hosting the game, and this control the track's booby traps. 


Anyways the race kicks off, and trouble started right with the first trap. The trap and many afterwards nearly killed the Duo but the unfair part is that every trap is disabled in one way or another so the frog loaded airship can just skim past them like they're nothing. 


Eventually, something happened at the game maker area, and the frogs that are manning the station got into a scuffle, which resulted in the failure to disable the last trap before the finish line. The duo won, while the airship with frogs got obilirated by that last trap into a fireball. 


Anyways the episode ends with the girl receiving a Hero's ceremony, and return home. The girl's step father still wears an expression of seriousness, yet he is satisfied with what happened that day. 


2. The second episode I remember watching went for a darker twist. The girl this time had to race alone on a sinisterly foggy day. Only at this race, her competitor is something straight out of some nightmare. 


This competitor first of all doesn't have a vehicle to race against the girl. It is a creature of just blackness, with a creepy white mask that looked somewhat like the anonymous mask, except it's white and featureless like slenderman’s face and with two creepy looking eyes each with a tiny black pupil. 


The competitor as mentioned doesn't have a vehicle, it doesn't need one. Through a rather gruesome transformation, it turns into some sort of a flying wing of blackness. 


The race starts, and the girl has a hard time concentrating due to some strange memory conflicting with her inner thoughts about the black creature. The traps are disabled that day, but the black creature competitor is taking no chance and is bumping the girl’s flying machine often. 


And then came this few minute of this episode that left an emotional impact on me. The creature had enough after the girl starts firing whatever her flying machine is equipped with at her (missiles, machine guns, cannons, etc). It slammed in front of the girl's flying machine and covered the cockpit up. The girl can't see a thing, and then something creepy happened. The creature's mask face appeared on the windscreen, and soon starts growing in size to cover the windscreen, giving the girl chills. 


The girl tried not to show it. She banks her machine at whatever direction possible to shake the creature off but eventually crashed. 




The girl fell into a deep coma and became unconscious. 




Moments later, we can see the creature pulling the girl out of the wreckage, and placing her a distance away from the now burning flying machine. By this time, the girl's step father arrived with some henchmen to see the outcome of the race. The creature after moaning over the girl for a few minutes, sheds a tear and transforms into a flying wing again before flying away.


Anyways the stepfather took her daughter home via his airship and in a way or two nurses her back to health. 


-Summary

So this is all I know about the anime. I only watched two random episodes, so I don't have a complete picture of the lore here. I hope that some anime nerds on this subreddit can help me pinpoint out this anime for me so I can retrace my childhood and relive it.


If there's anything you want to know, let me know in the comments.

This was after he had allegedly been disruptive in class for the past few days. \n\n&gt; Bumblebee was particularly triggered because the other student mentioned his ITE background.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; According to the account of what happened, Bumblebee is 21 years old, although this information cannot be verified.\n\n&gt; However, at the end of the 18-minute video, Bumblebee could be seen addressing the students, where he talked about how difficult it was for him to make it to polytechnic.\n\n&gt; 0.01 A student chokes Bumblebee after he made a lot of noise and dared the student to hit him.\n\n&gt; 1.01 Bumblebee does squatting/ taunting thing, while an adult looks at him wondering if this job is worth it.\n\n&gt; 1.45 Bumblebee threatens anyone who reports him.\n\n&gt; 1.58 Students cheer.\n\n&gt; 2.15 Bumblebee taunts entire class.\n\n&gt; 2.42 Bumblebee lunges at student who had choked him earlier.\n\n&gt; 2:54 Bumblebee losing it on lecture stage.

Red Singlet Guy says, “You ITE, you talk what”. Audience reacts.\n\n&gt; 5:55 Bumblebee slams Red Singlet Guy’s clothes. Red Singlet Guy says Bumblebee looks like a “blueberry cheesecake”. Crowd goes wild.\n\n&gt; 6.50 Lecturer tells students to keep quiet, let teachers handle it. And not encourage Bumblebee’s behaviour.\n\n&gt; 7:30 Red Singlet Guy is so done but snaps and challenges Bumblebee to a brawl. Gets escorted out of the hall.\n\n&gt; 8:08 Female student off-camera tells Bumblebee off for his behavior, tells him to grow up.\n\n&gt; 8.29 Other students tell Bumblebee to go out\n\n&gt; 9.22 “Every course surely have one of these people,” one student says.\n\n&gt; 10:20 Other Temasek Poly staff enter the lecture hall.\n\n&gt; 10:36 A teacher approaches Bumblebee. Bumblebee confronts her about having “mutual respect”. Teacher says something in response that results in all students going nuts.\n\n&gt; 10.40 In response, students all lose their shit. One shouts: “Alt + F4”. (This means a keyboard shortcut command that closes down the active window. A complete shutdown, in other words.) \n\n&gt; 11:40 Security team enters. Someone shouts: “SPCA!”\n\n&gt; 12.22 Security surrounds Bumblebee.\n\n&gt; 13.27 Bumblebee still talking and squatting.\n\n&gt; 14:09 Bumblebee takes the lecturer’s seat, worn out. Consoled by adults.\n\n&gt; 15.29 Security surrounds Bumblebee again, this time at the corner.\n\n&gt; 16:44 Bumblebee gets microphone, makes an impassioned speech about the difficult road he took studying in ITE before entering polytechnic.\n\n&gt; 17:16 Bumblebee takes off his t-shirt briefly. He is perspiring profusely. “I know here very hot because got me. I’m the hot thing here!” he said. He then said he could earn more money than someone with a degree.\n\n&gt; Bumblebee has been busy updating his Instagram Stories announcing that the media has contacted him for his side of the story:\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; And he has defended himself by saying he is standing up for ITE students and cannot see why others would flame him:\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; If you like what you read, follow us on [link is removed] and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MothershipSG) to get the latest updates.\n\n&gt;  Evening Read Evening Commute \n\n&gt; Stories to unwind after a long day\n\n&gt;  Videos  \n\n&gt; Cool visual stories you just can’t peel your eyes off\n\n&gt;  S’poreans Anyhowly Driving  \n\n&gt; [Source](https://mothership.sg/2018/04/temasek-polytechnic-bumblebee/)\n\n---\nv4.0 | [Github](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr) | [Readme/Changelog](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr/blob/master/README.md) | Summon me: `/u/rsg-retrivr summon`\n']"

They can also call SCDF through the app or submit photos and videos of the fire.\n\n&gt; The new function was officially launched yesterday by Mr K. Shanmugam, Law and Home Affairs Minister, at the SCDF&amp;apos;s annual workplan seminar.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; ""Prompt intervention by residents prevents the fire from spreading and also saves valuable SCDF resources, which can be deployed to more urgent incidents,"" he said in his keynote address.\n\n&gt; According to the SCDF, minor rubbish fires account for around half of residential fires, with the force responding to more than 1,000 such cases yearly.\n\n&gt; Since the fire alert function&amp;apos;s soft launch in January, close to 3,000 users have signed up for the alert. Notifications have been sent out for more than 300 fires.\n\n&gt; The function is an extension to SCDF&amp;apos;s myResponder app, which was unveiled at its workplan seminar in 2015 to allow registered users to render immediate medical aid to victims of cardiac arrest.\n\n&gt; The app, which has been downloaded more than 80,000 times since its launch, has seen its share of successes.\n\n&gt; SCDF reports that close to 1,700 users have responded to alerts of cardiac arrest and rendered necessary assistance since the app&amp;apos;s inception.\n\n&gt; The app also utilises a GPS geo-location feature, allowing the SCDF Operation Centre to locate incidents and deploy emergency resources swiftly when required.\n\n&gt; The SCDF myResponder app is available on the Apple and Google Play app stores.\n\n&gt; Mr Amos Hoe, 42, a manager, had earlier signed up for the fire alert notification. So when he received an alert earlier this month, he rushed to a burning rubbish bin one street away with a fire extinguisher in hand.\n\n&gt; Calling the app ""super useful"", Mr Hoe said: ""It basically broadens the available resources to include previously untapped personnel in the community.\n\n&gt; ""And for cardiac arrest victims and fires, time is of the essence.""\n\n&gt; [Source](http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/help-fight-fires-with-scdf-app-alert)\n\n---\nv4.0 | [Github](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr) | [Readme/Changelog](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr/blob/master/README.md) | Summon me: `/u/rsg-retrivr summon`\n']"

Further clampdowns on what one can say or do online are likely to perpetuate an environment in which distrust, resentment and fake news can spread.”\n\n&gt; At the hearing, committee member Edwin Tong asked Ms Han if the Act would ""impede the way governments would work"".\n\n&gt; Ms Han replied: ""It doesn&amp;apos;t impede the Government&amp;apos;s ability to keep things confidential for legitimate national security reasons. The Freedom of Information Act does not mean every top-secret classified document automatically becomes public.""\n\n&gt; Said Mr Tong: ""Matters that affect security … affect the way in which governments do their work, would become subject to scrutiny and that’s not necessarily a good thing is it?""\n\n&gt; To which Ms Han said:\xa0“They should be subject to scrutiny. They are elected officials.""\n\n&gt; LAWS “MORE HARM THAN GOOD”\n\n&gt; TOC echoed her sentiments while additionally suggesting the Government revoke the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act. “This would allow the media both online and offline to function the way they should, informing and educating the public about the world, instead of spreading government propaganda and narratives which go against common sense,” its submission read.\n\n&gt; Other solutions proposed by Ms Han included the need for media literacy education, starting from primary school level, as a “more effective” long-term measure.\n\n&gt; “The media cannot, and has never been, a foolproof gatekeeper of the truth, nor can any government or public institution,” she said. “Singaporeans should be taught to be sceptical of every source they read and to approach everything with a critical eye.”\n\n&gt; Ms Han also mooted the introduction of an independent ombudsman to represent public interest in addressing complaints against the Government and public institutions. This, she said, would go “a long way in building public confidence in the robustness of our democracy and its processes”.\n\n&gt; TOC, Ms Han, as well as another former TOC editor, Howard Lee, all spoke out against the need for legislation, pointing to how existing laws already suffice to address deliberate online falsehoods.\n\n&gt; “The potential for virality on social media has led some to argue that these laws do not allow the authorities to act swiftly enough to counter the speed with which fake news might spread,” said Ms Han. “However, we should be careful not to trade important principles of justice and due process for speed. Hasty measures carry the danger of according too much power to the authorities, at the expense of freedom of expression and open data in Singapore.”\n\n&gt; She instead urged for a review of current legislation “to remove overly broad laws that curb free speech and stifle the vigorous exchange of ideas and opinions on issues of national importance”.\n\n&gt; Mr Lee, now a PhD student, said a legislation would do “more harm than good to democratic processes”.\n\n&gt; “Any action taken that risks impacting freedom of expression and are not directed at the interests and real-world concerns of citizens can only discredit the Government’s efforts and risk accusations of political manipulation of laws,” he wrote.\n\n&gt; Mr Tong, however, clarified that ""No one here is saying\xa0that one looks at only legislation. But one must be looking at a different spectrum of items. I\xa0don&amp;apos;t disagree ...\xa0that when you\xa0look at disinformation that is perhaps less on the false side but still equally pernicious, education in the long term would be useful.""\n\n&gt; Ms Han, too, acknowledged that certain circumstances would require quick action and legislation, and referred to what [Dr Cherian George said](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/laws-against-racial-and-religious-insult-tend-to-backfire-10079972) in an earlier hearing: ""I\xa0believe Dr George gave an example of how when a preacher is preaching hate\xa0against a particular community, it&amp;apos;s not\xa0the time to be distributing media literacy flyers, and he specifically said &amp;apos;throw the book at him&amp;apos;.\n\n&gt; ""I would agree and my point is we already\xa0have many books to throw at him.""\n\n&gt; Mr Tong said: ""Well, the question whether there should be more books or less books or the same books. That is a question\xa0that will be taken up.""\n\n&gt; “WHO GETS TO DECIDE?”\n\n&gt; Mr Lee also commented that the Government’s current position on misinformation was “more notable for its lack of understanding and study of the issue, rather than a definitive stance supported by positive deduction”.\n\n&gt; He said the Government risked “lumping” a variety of terms to describe misinformation together under one banner, a point mirrored by Ms Han.\n\n&gt; “The discourse around this issue in Singapore gives a sense that the authorities are thinking of fake news as encompassing a broad range of activities from both foreign and local, state and non-state, actors,” she wrote.\n\n&gt; Ms Han said\xa0deliberate online falsehoods and fake news\xa0were, to begin with, “ill-defined terms … easily subject to abuse … to stifle dissent, discredit critical reporting and obscure serious problems”.\n\n&gt; She cited the example of US President Donald Trump, who she described as using the term “to discredit any piece of reporting, any media publication, or any journalist he doesn’t like”.\n\n&gt; Ms Han said the wider public would also grapple with properly defining fake news\xa0when it came to, for instance, satirical content like that of US-based website the Onion, Singapore-based New Nation and local TV comedy series The Noose.\n\n&gt; She noted the issue of intent was a challenge as well, particularly in scenarios such as the oft-cited one of friends or relatives sharing dubious or unverified information over WhatsApp chats - a “deliberate, but … far from malicious” act.\n\n&gt; In cases like these, asked TOC, “who will judge what is &amp;apos;falsehoods’ or ‘truth’? Will the Government alone decide what is false and what is true?”\n\n&gt; Ms Han also questioned: “Who gets to decide … ? Why should this person, or this body, be given that much power to decide on everyone else’s behalf? How can that power be checked so as to prevent abuse?\n\n&gt; “Any legislation built upon such ambiguous terms would be overly broad … to allow the authorities as much discretion as possible to respond to a variety of scenarios,” she said. “But ... while convenient for those involved in enforcement … (it) leaves people confused over what is or isn’t legal to do or say.\n\n&gt; “Faced with such uncertainty, Singaporeans might choose to err on the side of caution and self-censor … and thus have a chilling effect on open dialogue and exchange in Singapore.”\n\n&gt; [Source](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/independent-alternative-media-toc-fake-news-committee-10080122?cid=FBcna)\n\n---\nv4.0 | [Github](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr) | [Readme/Changelog](https://github.com/fterh/rsg-retrivr/blob/master/README.md) | Summon me: `/u/rsg-retrivr summon`\n']"

357,singapore,116675,[Premium]5Cs to fight online falsehoods,85y46w,Jammy_buttons,1521593814,3,0,,http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/5cs-to-fight-online-falsehoods,0.0,"['\n\nDuring its first week of hearings, the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods heard from academics, experts and community leaders on the potential impact of the problem and possible approaches to combat it.\n\nThey highlighted how Singapore\'s multicultural make-up and high Internet connectivity make it an easy target of disinformation campaigns that sow enmity among different groups and destabilise the country.\n\nDeliberate online falsehoods bear trademarks of what has been termed a ""wicked problem"", which refers to a complex problem, often intertwined with other issues, that has no easy solution.\n\nIt is a ""wicked problem"" due to considerable ambiguity, such as how falsehoods should be defined and who should define it. There is also a lack of data on the precise magnitude and impact of exposure to deliberate online falsehoods.\n\nThe problem, as evident in countries like the United States, Ukraine and Indonesia, is often connected to broader societal issues such as highly polarised politics and historical conflicts among communities.\n\nSuch a ""wicked problem"" warrants a whole-of-society approach, and experts seem to agree that a suite of measures comprising self-regulation by Internet intermediaries, increasing critical literacy, and fact-checking is required.\n\nThe role of legislation, its potential limitations and pitfalls have been a focal point in the ongoing deliberations. If the Government decides to adopt a legislative tool to tackle the problem at hand, what principles and considerations should guide the use of legislation?\n\nFirst, it is imperative to balance the need to protect national security and public order with safeguarding the ability of citizens and media to discuss and comment on pertinent issues, including those relating to governance and policies.\n\nSecond, legislation should not have the unintended effect of cultivating over-reliance on authorities among members of the public to help them discern truth from fiction.\n\nTo achieve this, there are two considerations when leveraging legislation.\nFOCUSED APPROACH MATTERS\n\nThe first is to be as precise as possible in deciding which type of deliberate online falsehoods to act against.This will avoid legislative overreach as well as channel limited resources to fighting the real fight. Based on our research, we categorise deliberate online falsehoods into two types - ""low breach"" and ""high breach"" falsehoods.\n\n""Low breach"" deliberate online falsehoods create anxiety among the public and cause inconveniences to people. Some examples in the local context include the photograph of a ""collapsed rooftop"" of Punggol Waterway Terraces in an article published on the All Singapore Stuff website, and the alleged selling of plastic rice and issuing of fines by the National Environment Agency at hawker centres.\n\nFortunately, in many ""low breach"" cases, the stakeholders involved are often able to quickly establish the facts and debunk the falsehood; corrective action is promptly taken. For instance, residents in Punggol took to Facebook to debunk the falsehood of the ""collapsed rooftop"", and the website editors deleted the article and issued an apology.\n\nHowever, what pose a more severe threat or ""high breach"" are the coordinated and covert efforts targeted at disrupting democratic processes in a country. Deliberate online falsehoods as part of a disinformation campaign have wreaked havoc on domestic politics and allegedly influenced referendum and election outcomes in other countries. Recently, the US Justice Department charged 13 Russians and three Russian firms with using stolen identities to pose as Americans, and with creating Facebook groups to distribute divisive content to subvert the 2016 US presidential election.\n\n""High breach"" deliberate online falsehoods also disrupt social and national stability by exploiting the pain points of a society, as seen in France and Indonesia. Thus, any use of legislation should focus on targeting such ""high breach"" deliberate online falsehoods.\nFRAMEWORK TO DECIDE WHICH FALSEHOODS TO TARGET\n\nSecond, the evolving and amoebic nature of cyberspace makes it difficult and impractical to come up with a precise legal definition for deliberate online falsehoods that will stand the test of time. Thus, we propose a ""5Cs"" framework to help determine what online falsehoods warrant regulatory intervention and whom to act against.\n\nThe first ""C"" is Content: An important question to ask is if the content is verifiably false. Falsehoods should be distinguished from opinion.\n\nThe second ""C"" is Context: The content of an online falsehood should be considered within a country\'s political, economic and social milieu. Despite rapid changes in the online space, Singapore\'s approach to regulating speech in general has always focused on protecting racial and religious harmony among its population and maintaining public order and security. Moving forward, one possible approach is to focus on deliberate online falsehoods that pose a threat to these pillars that Singapore has always upheld.\n\nThe third ""C"" is Communicator\'s Identity. Our research found that there are different types of perpetrators. They include members of the public, corporations, domestic political agents and foreign state actors. Some actors could also be part of a larger network (for example, accounts linked to a foreign Internet troll factory).\n\nThe fourth ""C"" is Communicator\'s Intent. Looking at intent means dealing with perpetrators differently: Ordinary individuals might then be dealt with differently from networked players and foreign state actors who act from a larger insidious agenda to disrupt social stability and national security.\n\nDifferent categories of potentially harmful online information serve different intents. For example, non-profit organisation First Draft identifies three types: misinformation such as parody and satire is false or inaccurate information produced or shared without the intent to deceive or harm; mal-information is information that is genuine but produced with a clear intention to cause harm; and disinformation is the deliberate creation and sharing of information known to be false with the intent to deceive or incite hostility. The earlier example of Russian manipulation of online discussion illustrates this.\n\nLegislative intervention should focus on disinformation.\n\nThe final ""C"" is Consequence. The extent and magnitude of a falsehood in terms of its frequency and volume should be considered. The likelihood of harm to Singapore\'s social fabric and national security, including its imminence, should also be taken into account.\n\nDeliberate online falsehoods pose severe challenges for societies, countries and global politics. The above proposed approaches will not eliminate the problem, but they help provide the necessary clarity and focus for countermeasures.\n\n•Carol Soon, senior research fellow, and Shawn Goh, research assistant, are from the Institute of Policy Studies, National University of Singapore.\n\n • This article is written based on the authors\' submission in their personal capacity to the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods.\n']"

The blade, the moment of despair, hesitate, fine, don't let anyone distract you. No disturbing. Razor blade ? Not sure, never removed razor blade. Along the vein? Yeah I guess. Heart ? Soul ? Something precious that my mother gave me. But no shouting out in Oban police station. No walking back, half anger, half despair. No scratching around. Cursing everyone you've ever known. Do it before. Fowler would know what to do. Don't become a shell. Black homeless walking towards. The day will come. In 2018 the government doesn't let it's slaves end their lives. Even the slaves veins are the property of he Queen /s. The lady in he Oban police station, the expression, looking at her through the slithole for the first time. Half laughing, half what? Half desire ? Katy's look on someone not so slightly. Mmm. Not sure. Not sure. Look so horrible. So revolting. Like a mad person laughing before I kick her head into the ground. The movies. Not sure. Not sure. Understanding not coming about her. ""You have brothers and sisters Vernon ?"" ""One brother one sister"" Will Cork boy appear ? This is my hanging spot. ""Are you he baby ?"" ""No, he oldest...."" ""....."" Did she work out Vernon facade out ? I might have even asked he same questions. The youngest would be the most likely to be passionate enough to get arrested over a girl. All oldest children friends, Fergus, Liam, Asif, Ben, Shane.

""But I'm banned from China....I can't come to you."" The cringiest of cringe? When will the moment come ? Buying the disposable razor, breaking the plastic.

The hot bath ? Godfather 2? Whisky, a full bottle. Locked door. No eating once plan decided, no drinking, no pissing.

Mmm, starving before, lying motionless, keep thought in head, like Sheen in Apocalypse now, let the fly crawl on face. Vernon will soon be fly food.

The final subject Tan Guan ? The one Vernon was afraid to think about. ""Any thoughts of suicide vernon?"" "" No"" ""you sure ?"" ""Yeah."" Cork sacrifice allowed a lot of food for writing? 2nd lietenant not here caught for shoplifting. Vernon's been disciplined about the law recently. Didn't want to write a sad letter to Katy from the cell. Didn't want to lose wifi lose tan guan. And Cork ? Ambush failed. Go to Mother Crack feel better ? Confront his buddy? Buddy to confront girlfriend? Chainreaction ? Two girls zhengzhou ? Lowest of low. Finally strike out ? Realization ? They HAVE to kill us. America, Britain, Canada, Australia, France, New Z.

Vernon remembers the bald Englishman outside Victoria "" stay down, stay down."" The trainstaff in bright orange bib things. ""You ok?"" Blood all over trousers, all over top, all over jacket. Staring.

Now there is fear Tan Guan. I'm proud of this writing. Looking up and checking. Cork said he wanted me to delete the writing from the tablet but in his destruction he could destroy my writing on hell and suicide. But no...wait this is like the 5th napkin. But words still coming. My sister, Katy.... Blood dripping like a tap. Looking around. ""You ok."" Bored expression. Walking toward the bathroom, purposefully, slightly confused, blood, injury, face, clothes covered, look at expressions, nothing, worse, something worse. Want to take off.

Return to anonymity. ""Small towns can be oppressive, you don't have the anonymity you have in the city."" Why should Cork disrupt this food thought for Tan Guan? Or am I writing to Ross ? I intend to copy him over. Do I write eagerly motivated by that tall body behind the counter in Connel shop. Blue eyes ? Long brown hair, smile, then lower eyes. My expression hurted her?

Basically I've been talking to social workers about emotional abuse at home + neglect (refusing to bring me to the doctor even when I coughed blood) and now an FSC actually called my father (CPS referred me to said FSC), so he tried to talk to me about it. A conversation yesterday meant to address academic pressures he put on me (he asked me because it was something the FSC pointed out to him) ended when I walked off because he feeded a conversation about academic stress into arguing over when I should do my TYS. So today he had another conversation, which I made clear right from the start that I did not want to have until the FSC met him on Tuesday night. Basically the conversation gained so much tension with him undermining me and my teachers, that I made the stupid decision of kicking him in the nuts. Then he started shouting ""WHY DID YOU KICK ME"" and slammed me into the wall behind knocking a lot of things over and continued dragging me around the kitchen, so I pretended to agree with him to make him stop. (Later my mother pointed out that he made me bleed on the neck, but I didn't feel anything at the time) 

So after that I just sat there for a while before beginning to text this lady I knew from a CDC, and then my mom came home. She undermined how I felt throughout the 12 months period since my father has started being the way he is (may 2017), before threatening to evict me once again, so this time I actually began packing my things, and she said ""go in the morning (10+ pm by then)"". So I got ready to shower and everything before bed and she kept making fun of me to my sister (as usual after events like this), and then asked my sister to ask me if she wants me to take her to the library tomorrow??

There are 2 male polytechnic students (either both of them are malay or one of them is) seated in the middle seats. I was seated opposite them and there were a lot of passengers in between (peak hour from Jurong to Marina Bay). 

One of them (the one seated right the middle) spreads his legs wide. And there is a middle-aged Chinese man that is standing right in the middle of dem legs, holding the train handle. (I assume that those legs spreaded after the man assumed his position). Easily from where I was seated I could tell that any person trapped in that bermuda triangle is not comfortable and is not right. It's plainly inconsiderate behaviour. 

I really wanted to just stand out and call them out. (By calling them out I meant saying something along the lines of 'Could you please close your legs and sit properly?') I kinda really wanted to go. I really had the urge to do it. But I decided against it. Because I hate confrontations (being in a altercation in public - NOPE)  and it doesn't affect me. 

I think you'd definitely have found yourselves in situations where you're made uncomfortable or inconvenienced by entitled, shitty, asshole people but being Singaporeans (meek, afraid of trouble, kiasee), you'd choose to ignore it while silently cursing them mentally or just push them irritatedly away when you leave. Sometimes, because you're an adult, you go. You go and call them out/fight them. Maybe it ends okay or it ends in a fight that leaves everyone pissed. 'You gotta fight for your space so that you don't boil over.' -&gt; something I read elsewhere on Reddit that sums up how I feel and try to be. (I'm a doormat. I realised that I was one who wouldn't call people out for taking advantage of me because of the fear of confrontation and that I think I'd always lose. I'm more aware of things now. )

So, I just want to know if you are being inconvenienced by assholes or see people in such situations where you're not affected, will you call them out in public?

TL;DR: I saw some asshole behaviours on the train which did not affect me but it is wrong. Will you call them out?

This might be old news, but I just can't stand a impostor that's acting as Aaron for fame and sponsors.

Doesn't matter if you like Aaron or dislike him, let's keep that aside for now, I am sure everyone dislikes impostors.

I am here to raise awareness that the Instagram account @aaronlimjunjie__ is not owned by the real Aaron. The person acting as the real Aaron is called Fyan, Fyan used to stream on Bigo and a app called BeLieve but after he sees that the real Aaron has taken a break from Instagram and deleted his account he decided to take the chance and get his fame, and give shoutouts to scammers!

Set aside whatever love/hate messages that you intend to send to him, because attention is currently what the Impostor wants.

Currently only about 5-10 percent(?) of his followers know he's fake and that's absurd.

Also refrain from taking part in his IPhone X or Food giveaways that he is hosting, the word is that the giveaways are sponsored by a scammer that uses stolen credit cards to make the purchase.

For evidence visit the Instagram pages below, feel free to message them to know more as well, we need to spread the word around and prevent people from taking part in fraudulent giveaways that can give them unnecessary issues.

On a side note, I am sure some would be interested to know on how the real Aaron is doing, I have heard from his friends that he has left social media for good and he is focusing on his studys now, just in case anybody missed out on the grapevine, he has already apologized for the incident on his Instagram account a day before he deleted it. This serves as another reason why we need to spread the word that there's a impersonator, its making it look like Aaron hasn't turned over a new leaf when he already did.

376,singapore,125862,Anyone has a/have crazy neighbour(s)?,8tqx8y,alexcalaunanjr,1529936780,35,22,"Anyone has any crazy neighbour stories? Well I got one. 

Been living in Singapore for 18 years. 21 this year. It wasn’t until 2008 that I moved to HDB from a rented condo. From HDB to condo there isn’t really much of a difference apart from facilities, but i got comfortable quickly. There’s this particular chinese family that’s across my block. I knew their existence for the first time back in 2008 when I saw her family fight with their indian neighbour. Since it was long ago and I was young, I can’t remember why or what they were fighting about. Something about commotion or whatever. I was going Bintan that afternoon, what do i care. 

After that incident, the lady from that family became very apparent. She would make a lot of noise, shout loud enough for the neighbourhood to hear she’s there, and I think the indian neighbour they were fighting with moved out after a while. That’s where things started getting worse. 

If I’m not wrong, I hear their lady’s “son” (i think) shout a lot and seem to be in an argument, so did the lady’s “husband”, and these arguments happen late at night, with doors banging and all that. I think it’s with the lady. She kept going at her noise making routine which is pretty often. After a while, I never hear or see the “husband” or “son” in the house any more, or around. Just her. 

Think this was when she really meets insanity. She now just scolds everybody and anybody she sees in the neighbourhood. CCB, KNN, F word, all that shit you name and she definitely has said those over the decade. Heck, she scolds kids downstairs playing when they’re “making noise” when it’s like early evening, a perfect time to play for kids. Her biggest pet peeve is probably dogs. A few stories above my unit, there’s a family with a dog, and when the dog barks, she barks back and start saying like “Block 200 6th floor at the window your f*cking dog” or whatever idk. What’s worse is that at night a lot of dog owners hang around with their dogs at the park and the dogs are quiet, but she scolds them and makes a fuss. She also says stuff to others about life, like “In Singapore every month you get CPF but in heaven got no CPF”. Or like “Your make up fake you also fake, your nose fake you fake”. And filial piety too. Or like once when i was going home and i was under her block, i coughed, and she coughed back and started scolding me. 

As much as this is insane of her, I feel bad for her. I don’t know what she has gone through to reach that point of insanity, and as much as the neighbourhood is noisier or vulgar because of her, it’s still sad. She does have social workers who come to visit her, as she mentioned before. 

Anyway sorry for the long post. Does anyone else have crazy neighbour stories?

You are right. This is not a local problem though. It is a worldwide problem. Autistic, IMH and down syndrome should not be use as insults. These are real mental illness and the patients neither deserve nor want these illness. We should be empathetic towards them.

Base on similar line of argument, I would even say stupid, retarded and low IQ should also not be use as insults. People are just poor like that. However, I am perfectly fine with words such as ignorant and lazy because they are much more deserving.

383,singapore,124295,Raising awareness on Betta splendens fish abuse. They have feelings too.,8ppr60,damstereiw1,1528511451,7,27,"RAISING AWARENESS ON BETTA SPLENDENS FISH ABUSE. In this post, I will be going over the different ways these intelligent fish are being abused, and how we, as a community can solve this issue.

Betta fish are incredibly intelligent for their size. A study on Betta courtship and mating preferences further elaborates on my point. I quote directly from the study: ""If provided the opportunity, females will watch two 3 males fight over territory and select the winner with which to mate. In addition, male betta has even been observed watching two other males fight and then challenging the loser."" This is an example of how intelligent they can be.

Link to the study: [https://publications.lakeforest.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi](https://publications.lakeforest.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi)

…

My observations:

They can be taught tricks, and I have observed that they enjoy interacting with their owner. My female Betta always shows excitement, whether or not she has been feed, whenever she sees me.

Link to video 1 (Betta fish getting excited when she sees me): [https://youtu.be/z\_EcpyHN5Yc](https://youtu.be/z_EcpyHN5Yc)

Despite the fact that there isn't any food on my finger, my Betta fish would still come back over and over again, rubbing his body against my finger, seemingly trying to snuggle.

Link to video 2 (Betta fish playing with my finger): [https://youtu.be/PeYWIHOlJrY](https://youtu.be/PeYWIHOlJrY)

Another example of their curiosity is shown in another video, where my Betta fish tries to follow wherever I go. She wasn't looking for food as I just fed her a lot.

Link to video 3 (Betta fish following me around): [https://youtu.be/WDED7ZBIs9I](https://youtu.be/WDED7ZBIs9I)

Another example of their sentience is kindly shared by a fellow Betta fish keeper. Two of his Male Betta fish has successfully been able to share a single aquarium without any fights. This shows that these fish do indeed have personalities. Some are aggressive while the others are more docile.

Link to Imgur album 1 (Two male Betta fish in one tank): [https://imgur.com/a/sHLfTTl](https://imgur.com/a/sHLfTTl)

However, as humans, we tend to be self\-entitled to a certain extent. Generally, we take action only when we think it is right, and not based on actual facts and observations. Betta fish are so intelligent and inquisitive like other pets such as dogs.

Here's the part that I think is complete bullshit: Post a picture of a dog getting abused and the whole world will react, but post a picture of a fish being abused and no one bats an eye. Our society only cares about what we associate with. Dogs can smile, cry and can vividly show their emotion and thus people think they deserve better treatment than other pets, despite the fact that fish show emotion too.

PROBLEMS:

Problem 1: Betta fish being abused by pet/fish stores.

One form of abuse is mistreatment of Betta fish in fish stores. This is due to the massive amount of Betta fish being brought into their stores.

The store owners/staff are unable to provide proper housing and treatment for the Betta fish. Male Betta fish are being stored in cups and plastic bags, where the water is usually not changed by the shopkeepers, resulting in murky, ammonia\-rich water which harms the Betta fish. Unclean water exposes Betta fish to disease and illnesses such as fin rotting and dropsy. These Betta fish can only sit in their little containers, with little hope as the water around them gets taken over by bacteria and disease.

Other than water quality, male Betta fish also suffer from neglect from store owners. Male Betta fish get agitated when they see other Betta fish and will flare up. Prolong flaring can lead to exhaustion and stress. There has to be a divider between every tank with a male Betta fish to prevent flaring.

Water flow also affects a Betta fish's health. In female sorority tanks, I have observed that some shop owners have turned up the water flow so high, to the point where some of the weaker or smaller fish are unable to swim and/or breathe properly.

Speaking of female sorority tanks, I have also observed that due to lack of space, some female Betta fish resort to fighting their tankmates, this can result in torn fins. Torn fins are exposed to bacteria, which can result in a disease outbreak. The weaker females are also neglected by the shop owners. They have no hope, as they get bullied by larger female Betta, to the point where they weaken and die.

Link to video 6: (Fish store staff fails to maintain their female Betta fish): [https://youtu.be/G9inFtlDwyA](https://youtu.be/G9inFtlDwyA)

Problem 2: Betta fish being abused by homeowners.

Another form of abuse is carried out by Betta fish owners at home. This is due to large\-scale misinformation.

Because of incorrect information being provided by the staff and/or workers in fish stores, Betta fish owners may end up, unknowingly, mistreat their Betta fish. Undersized plastic containers are being advertised and sold as ""Betta tanks"". These tanks are far too small for Betta fish or let alone any live animal. This misinformation leads to consumers keeping Betta in those tanks.

Link to Imgur album 2(Unethical ""Betta tanks""): [https://imgur.com/a/w9Xq0eV](https://imgur.com/a/w9Xq0eV)

The world has to change the way they see Betta fish. We need to understand that Betta fish are highly complex animals. They are our PETS, not our DECORATIONS. A pet is something in which you emotionally and/or physically bond with, having mutual respect for each other, while a decoration is for your personal benefit, something that you don't care about.

When a person buys a Betta fish just because it looks pretty, and keeps it in a tiny container because ""Having a proper aquarium is too troublesome and expensive"", that person is using the fish for his personal benefit, he/she only likes the fish because it looks pretty and neglects its well\-being.

Problem 3: Betta fish being abused by breeders.

Another form of abuse is carried out by some Betta fish breeders. This is due to the high demand for competition\-winning fish and greed for money or personal enjoyment, without considering the well\-being of the Betta fish.

These breeders produce physically deformed/defected Betta fish because they look attractive and/or unique.

One example of this is the ""XL Halfmoon"" Betta fish. These fish are like their regular half\-moon counterparts but has exceedingly long and heavy fins. At a mere one year old, these fish start developing spinal problems (Curved/bent spine) and have trouble swimming, and they even have trouble breathing due to their fins. There have been reports of Betta living up to 8 years. However, fish bred with physical defects have shortened lifespans. Even if they live long, they will live in pain. This fin type is mainly bred for competition.

Link to Imgur album 3 (Betta fish age limit): [https://imgur.com/a/x68Z5uv](https://imgur.com/a/x68Z5uv)

Essentially, breeders like these put live animals through prolonged pain, just for competition money and trophies.

SOLUTIONS:

Solutions for pet stores/staff:

⦁ Check on their Betta fish more.

⦁ Make sure to feed all Betta fish at least once a day.

⦁ Make sure the water flow isn't too high.

⦁ Make sure the water changed frequently (minimally once every 3 days). Isolate any diseased fish.

⦁ Fish that are getting attacked by their tankmates/are attacking their tankmates should be isolated too.

⦁ Isolated Betta fish should live in at least three litres of dechlorinated water, with proper filtration and frequent water changes, minimally once every three days. I have observed that my Betta fish enjoys resting on live plants, so I think live plants like Java ferns should be an edition to Betta aquariums in stores. Please refer to the Imgur album below for more details on how I think isolated Betta fish should be kept.

Link to Imgur album4(How I think isolated Betta fish should be kept): [https://imgur.com/a/7jFtF6d](https://imgur.com/a/7jFtF6d)

⦁ If there is any fighting in community/female sorority tanks, increase tank size and add live plants such as Java ferns for hiding. Make sure hiding spots are not sharp as Betta fish's fins are fragile. If this doesn't work, isolate the aggressor. The fish that are attacked may need to be isolated for medical treatment. Please refer to the Imgur image below for more details on how I think female Betta sororities should be set\-up.

⦁ Link to Imgur image (how I think female Betta sororities should be set\-up): [https://imgur.com/a/ffnyItw](https://imgur.com/a/ffnyItw)

⦁ Provide advice to customers on how to care for Betta fish.

⦁ Refrain from selling or labelling tanks under 5 litres as ""Betta tanks""

IT CAN BE DONE! One of the fish stores I went to has a female sorority tank. Most of the female Betta are actively swimming, with little to no fighting or injury. In my opinion, it certainly feels better to buy fish from responsible fish stores like these.

Link to video 7 (Betta fish being taken good care of): [https://youtu.be/sSY6z8KlzrE](https://youtu.be/sSY6z8KlzrE)

Solutions for homeowners:

⦁ Do proper research before purchasing a Betta fish. Take proper care of Betta fish.

⦁ Provide at least 5 litres of dechlorinated water in the Betta tank. Preferably, the tank should have a filter.

⦁ Frequent water changes needed (minimally once every 3 days) as Betta fish produce lots of ammonia. Too much ammonia accumulated in the water can harm the fish.

⦁ Feed the fish at least once a day. Feed until the belly of the fish looks slightly round. Be careful not to overfeed.

⦁ Every week, allow the fish to fast for one day. This allows their digestive system to rest and prevents bloating and illnesses.

⦁ Refer to my diagram for more information on how an aquarium works.

Link to Imgur image (How an aquarium works): [https://imgur.com/a/RVodgAK](https://imgur.com/a/RVodgAK)

Solutions for Betta breeders:

⦁ Refrain from breeding fish with physical defects, such as exceedingly long fins and spinal problems.

⦁ Refrain from breeding Betta as a whole. A lower supply of Betta means that they can be better cared for. In my opinion, even if you do it for money, it is not worth putting live animals through pain and hardship. If you want to breed Betta fish just to enjoy the courtship and copulation process, proceed to destroy the bubble nest after, unless you are able to provide proper care for the fry.

Solutions for the community:

⦁ Send letters to the Agri\-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) addressing this issue.

⦁ Spread the message. Educate the people around you about this issue.

⦁ Send letters to fish stores addressing this issue

⦁ Refrain from supporting sellers/stores that mistreat Betta fish or misinform customers about Betta fish. Supporting such sellers/stores will only encourage them to bring in more Betta fish.

⦁ Refrain from supporting Betta fish breeders that breed fish with physical defects, supporting such breeders will only encourage them to breed more Betta fish with physical defects.

My personal thoughts:

Personally, I think it is fine to store Betta fish in slightly undersized tanks for the sake of sales and convenience in fish stores, but when it goes too far to the point where the animal's mental and physical health is negatively impacted, it turns into a problem. In my opinion, it is not worth putting live, sentient animals through agony and hardship just for profits. How do these people live with the guilt, do they even...care?

As mentioned early in this post, there is evidence of sentience in Betta fish. Sentient, just like us. Imagine you are one of the female Betta fish in the fish stores. Your limbs are rotting away as your roommates attack you over and over again, in the filthy, murky water clouded with your own faeces. You're in pain, you try to ignore that piece of flesh dangling from your behind. You're exhausted and want to settle down and rest, but the staff of the fish store ""accidentally"" set the water flow too high, to the point where you have trouble moving and breathing. You can hardly see anything as that ring of mould around your eyeballs grow thicker and thicker with every day that passes. Your roommate strikes again. A mouthful of teeth rips out your gill membrane. You taste blood as you breathe. More and more blood gushing out of your half\-eaten body. You give up, and the flow of the current carries you to your untimely demise...

...Is this what YOU want?

Why can't we just appreciate these animals for how beautiful and intelligent they are, instead of abusing them on such a large scale for money?

We were the ones that started this problem. We were the ones that bred these fish on such a large scale, to the point where we can't control the massive supply. We have almost forgotten that these are live animals, and we use them for mere profits. We need to solve this problem, that we have caused...

I hope we, as responsible fish keepers, can work together and try to come up with ideas to solve this issue. Please kindly comment any ideas or opinions you have.

团结就是力量. Together, we can make a difference. Whether something changes, whether the torture and the pain stops, depends on YOU. Will you fight for the fighters?

I hope this post sparks a friendly discussion.

You may support my endeavours by sharing this post. Thank you.

However, as humans, we tend to be self\-entitled to a certain extent. Generally, we take action only when we think it is right, and not based on actual facts and observations. Betta fish are so intelligent and inquisitive like other pets such as dogs.

Here's the part that I think is complete bullshit: Post a picture of a dog getting abused and the whole world will react, but post a picture of a fish being abused and no one bats an eye. Our society only cares about what we associate with. Dogs can smile, cry and can vividly show their emotion and thus people think they deserve better treatment than other pets, despite the fact that fish show emotion too.

PROBLEMS:

Problem 1: Betta fish being abused by pet/fish stores.

One form of abuse is mistreatment of Betta fish in fish stores. This is due to the massive amount of Betta fish being brought into their stores.

The store owners/staff are unable to provide proper housing and treatment for the Betta fish. Male Betta fish are being stored in cups and plastic bags, where the water is usually not changed by the shopkeepers, resulting in murky, ammonia\-rich water which harms the Betta fish. Unclean water exposes Betta fish to disease and illnesses such as fin rotting and dropsy. These Betta fish can only sit in their little containers, with little hope as the water around them gets taken over by bacteria and disease.

Other than water quality, male Betta fish also suffer from neglect from store owners. Male Betta fish get agitated when they see other Betta fish and will flare up. Prolong flaring can lead to exhaustion and stress. There has to be a divider between every tank with a male Betta fish to prevent flaring.

Water flow also affects a Betta fish's health. In female sorority tanks, I have observed that some shop owners have turned up the water flow so high, to the point where some of the weaker or smaller fish are unable to swim and/or breathe properly.

Speaking of female sorority tanks, I have also observed that due to lack of space, some female Betta fish resort to fighting their tankmates, this can result in torn fins. Torn fins are exposed to bacteria, which can result in a disease outbreak. The weaker females are also neglected by the shop owners. They have no hope, as they get bullied by larger female Betta, to the point where they weaken and die.

Problem 2: Betta fish being abused by homeowners.

Another form of abuse is carried out by Betta fish owners at home. This is due to large\-scale misinformation.

Because of incorrect information being provided by the staff and/or workers in fish stores, Betta fish owners may end up, unknowingly, mistreat their Betta fish. Undersized plastic containers are being advertised and sold as ""Betta tanks"". These tanks are far too small for Betta fish or let alone any live animal. This misinformation leads to consumers keeping Betta in those tanks.

Link to Imgur album 2(Unethical ""Betta tanks""): [https://imgur.com/a/w9Xq0eV](https://imgur.com/a/w9Xq0eV)

The world has to change the way they see Betta fish. We need to understand that Betta fish are highly complex animals. They are our PETS, not our DECORATIONS. A pet is something in which you emotionally and/or physically bond with, having mutual respect for each other, while a decoration is for your personal benefit, something that you don't care about.

When a person buys a Betta fish just because it looks pretty, and keeps it in a tiny container because ""Having a proper aquarium is too troublesome and expensive"", that person is using the fish for his personal benefit, he/she only likes the fish because it looks pretty and neglects its well\-being.

Problem 3: Betta fish being abused by breeders.

Another form of abuse is carried out by some Betta fish breeders. This is due to the high demand for competition\-winning fish and greed for money or personal enjoyment, without considering the well\-being of the Betta fish.

These breeders produce physically deformed/defected Betta fish because they look attractive and/or unique.

One example of this is the ""XL Halfmoon"" Betta fish. These fish are like their regular half\-moon counterparts but has exceedingly long and heavy fins. At a mere one year old, these fish start developing spinal problems (Curved/bent spine) and have trouble swimming, and they even have trouble breathing due to their fins. There have been reports of Betta living up to 8 years. However, fish bred with physical defects have shortened lifespans. Even if they live long, they will live in pain. This fin type is mainly bred for competition.

Link to Imgur album 3 (Betta fish age limit): [https://imgur.com/a/x68Z5uv](https://imgur.com/a/x68Z5uv)

Essentially, breeders like these put live animals through prolonged pain, just for competition money and trophies.

SOLUTIONS:

Solutions for pet stores/staff:

⦁ Check on their Betta fish more.

⦁ Make sure to feed all Betta fish at least once a day.

⦁ Make sure the water flow isn't too high.

⦁ Make sure the water changed frequently (minimally once every 3 days). Isolate any diseased fish.

⦁ Fish that are getting attacked by their tankmates/are attacking their tankmates should be isolated too.

⦁ Isolated Betta fish should live in at least three litres of dechlorinated water, with proper filtration and frequent water changes, minimally once every three days. I have observed that my Betta fish enjoys resting on live plants, so I think live plants like Java ferns should be an edition to Betta aquariums in stores. Please refer to the Imgur album below for more details on how I think isolated Betta fish should be kept.

Link to Imgur album4(How I think isolated Betta fish should be kept): [https://imgur.com/a/7jFtF6d](https://imgur.com/a/7jFtF6d)

⦁ If there is any fighting in community/female sorority tanks, increase tank size and add live plants such as Java ferns for hiding. Make sure hiding spots are not sharp as Betta fish's fins are fragile. If this doesn't work, isolate the aggressor. The fish that are attacked may need to be isolated for medical treatment. Please refer to the Imgur image below for more details on how I think female Betta sororities should be set\-up.

⦁ Link to Imgur image (how I think female Betta sororities should be set\-up): [https://imgur.com/a/ffnyItw](https://imgur.com/a/ffnyItw)

⦁ Provide advice to customers on how to care for Betta fish.

⦁ Refrain from selling or labelling tanks under 5 litres as ""Betta tanks""

IT CAN BE DONE! One of the fish stores I went to has a female sorority tank. Most of the female Betta are actively swimming, with little to no fighting or injury. In my opinion, it certainly feels better to buy fish from responsible fish stores like these.

Link to video 7 (Betta fish being taken good care of): [https://youtu.be/sSY6z8KlzrE](https://youtu.be/sSY6z8KlzrE)

Solutions for homeowners:

⦁ Do proper research before purchasing a Betta fish. Take proper care of Betta fish.

⦁ Provide at least 5 litres of dechlorinated water in the Betta tank. Preferably, the tank should have a filter.

⦁ Frequent water changes needed (minimally once every 3 days) as Betta fish produce lots of ammonia. Too much ammonia accumulated in the water can harm the fish.

⦁ Feed the fish at least once a day. Feed until the belly of the fish looks slightly round. Be careful not to overfeed.

⦁ Every week, allow the fish to fast for one day. This allows their digestive system to rest and prevents bloating and illnesses.

⦁ Refer to my diagram for more information on how an aquarium works.

Link to Imgur image (How an aquarium works): [https://imgur.com/a/RVodgAK](https://imgur.com/a/RVodgAK)

Solutions for Betta breeders:

⦁ Refrain from breeding fish with physical defects, such as exceedingly long fins and spinal problems.

⦁ Refrain from breeding Betta as a whole. A lower supply of Betta means that they can be better cared for. In my opinion, even if you do it for money, it is not worth putting live animals through pain and hardship. If you want to breed Betta fish just to enjoy the courtship and copulation process, proceed to destroy the bubble nest after, unless you are able to provide proper care for the fry.

Solutions for the community:

⦁ Send letters to the Agri\-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) addressing this issue.

⦁ Spread the message. Educate the people around you about this issue.

⦁ Send letters to fish stores addressing this issue

⦁ Refrain from supporting sellers/stores that mistreat Betta fish or misinform customers about Betta fish. Supporting such sellers/stores will only encourage them to bring in more Betta fish.

⦁ Refrain from supporting Betta fish breeders that breed fish with physical defects, supporting such breeders will only encourage them to breed more Betta fish with physical defects.

My personal thoughts:

Personally, I think it is fine to store Betta fish in slightly undersized tanks for the sake of sales and convenience in fish stores, but when it goes too far to the point where the animal's mental and physical health is negatively impacted, it turns into a problem. In my opinion, it is not worth putting live, sentient animals through agony and hardship just for profits. How do these people live with the guilt, do they even...care?

As mentioned early in this post, there is evidence of sentience in Betta fish. Sentient, just like us. Imagine you are one of the female Betta fish in the fish stores. Your limbs are rotting away as your roommates attack you over and over again, in the filthy, murky water clouded with your own faeces. You're in pain, you try to ignore that piece of flesh dangling from your behind. You're exhausted and want to settle down and rest, but the staff of the fish store ""accidentally"" set the water flow too high, to the point where you have trouble moving and breathing. You can hardly see anything as that ring of mould around your eyeballs grow thicker and thicker with every day that passes. Your roommate strikes again. A mouthful of teeth rips out your gill membrane. You taste blood as you breathe. More and more blood gushing out of your half\-eaten body. You give up, and the flow of the current carries you to your untimely demise...

...Is this what YOU want?

Why can't we just appreciate these animals for how beautiful and intelligent they are, instead of abusing them on such a large scale for money?

We were the ones that started this problem. We were the ones that bred these fish on such a large scale, to the point where we can't control the massive supply. We have almost forgotten that these are live animals, and we use them for mere profits. We need to solve this problem, that we have caused...

I hope we, as responsible fish keepers, can work together and try to come up with ideas to solve this issue. Please kindly comment any ideas or opinions you have.

团结就是力量. Together, we can make a difference. Whether something changes, whether the torture and the pain stops, depends on YOU. Will you fight for the fighters?

I hope this post sparks a friendly discussion.

387,singapore,129436,"Help me, I have been sexually harassed by my neighbours for three years",949bo1,pekyj,1533300739,262,1295,"I spent the last three years being harassed, having my modesty outraged by my neighbours and getting ignored by the authorities. Here’s my story.


For years, my neighbours have been provoking my family and me. My mother, a frail hawker who has to wake up at 4:30am for work, has been greatly disturbed by the noise pollution created by them. Kids running around, teenagers singing loudly. My younger brother was once afraid of taking the lift because the boys threw their football at him.


Little did I know the rowdy boys were just a prelude to an avalanche of problems. As they grew up to become teenagers with raging hormones, they started catcalling me. They hauled me derogatory names whenever I entered or exited the lift. They dared each other to look under my skirt, speaking in Malay, thinking that we do not understand the language.


It is a common occurrence. Every day since the first incident three years ago, I enter my lift in a befuddled state and prepare for the impending deluge of verbal abuse. The surge of fear that rises up my throat as the lift approaches my floor is an everyday occurrence.


If they are not hanging around the lift lobby when I walk out, I wonder when will I bump into them again. Possibly the next day. If they are present, I hurry from the lift lobby to my house, hanging my head in shame and avoiding any eye contact. What am I ashamed of? That I’m a girl, therefore, I deserve to be harassed? I grew afraid of going out or returning home because that meant volunteering to be abused.


I trudged past them again last night, with a look of continual defeat. The verbal abuse and sniggers continued. They knew that I've about given up all hopes. It finally dawned upon me that my house is no longer a home I can happily return to.


I've had enough of being irascible and irritable by the time I make it to my gates. I detest the fact that the excitement of seeing my mother after a long day has been replaced with me growing increasingly frustrated at her, as if she landed me at my predicament because she picked this estate.


I’m sorry, mommy. I now realise that my mother does not have it easier either. She never experienced uninterrupted rest since the day my neighbours started harassing us. If she's not worried about them harassing me, her sleep is disturbed by the mob of kids that insist on playing at my corridor dead at night.


If you are a parent, I am sure you know how helpless my mother felt. That her own daughter was getting bullied in a way that is illegal in some European countries yet the town council and policemen would not step in to help. That she, as a hawker, has no means of getting us out of this estate until either I or my brother gets married.


Even my friends who visited are horrified by the image presented to them. My girl friends get harassed as well. No one can bring themselves to believe that this part of Singapore — a fully developed country — exists.


We threatened them with law enforcement and for a while, they stopped. But when they realised it was all but empty threats, they started again. So we stuck to our words and called the town council. After my first call, they promised to look into it and I was given a number to call lest they create a disturbance again. Nobody picked up the phone when we called in.


The same happened when we contacted the police through the non-emergency number, who said they will be coming in 10-20 minutes to investigate the matter but nobody turned up. Now I see that even civil servants are unwilling to help us.


I only saw a glimmer of hope when I contacted the People's Association of my area. We set up a meeting during which, they assured me that my MP was concerned. They reassured me that they will be conducting routine checks. Let’s be real here, the noise pollution and harassment happen after office hours. Who would sacrifice their family time to deal with this issue? Still, I placed my trust in them.


They emphasised that I should lie low while they liaised with the town council and police station. Well, it’s been one year since, and the situation has not changed. Not even one bit.


I turned to other options. I compiled a video of the times their siblings/cousins/friends disturbed our neighbours to send to my MP for his perusal. (I’ve lurked on reddit for about seven years now but I’m pretty new to posting stuff so I’m unsure how can I embed it here. The video’s on my Facebook account, accessible at fb /pekyj. Please let me know if linking this way isn’t allowed — I can remove this part immediately)


The video shows just a few, and the least severe, instances I managed to capture with my phone — all the catcalling incidences went unrecorded because I do not feel safe taking a video with their piercing stares on me. The video is a shortened, censored version. I censored their faces before posting because these kids, while disruptive, were not the source of my torment.


The video was shown only to prove a point: that there was an issue of disturbance and overcrowding. Before you ask, yes, the video clips were taken well after 10pm.


The last straw was a distasteful reply I received from my MP(’s PA, I assume), dripping with sarcasm.


It reads:
""You can consider a variety of different possible Court orders if you are of the view that there has been nuisance or harassment or that your neighbours are denying you quiet enjoyment. Since the Town Council or the Police is not an option which you wish to consider, and if you wish to consider your legal options, you can consider consulting with the Law Society for recommendations.""
I refuse to even reply to that atrocious email. Consider my legal options? If I had the money, I would not be living in a rented two-room flat. I do not understand how they can’t see that it is not about the peace, but my safety. Why should I feel unsafe in my own neighbourhood? What happened to Singapore being the safest country in 2018?


I could shout something back and pray that it will stop the abuse, but should I take the chance? I am a petite girl — just a little beyond 150cm — and they are a group of guys. Sometimes up to 10 in a group. Forget about whether it’s legal or not to have that many people living in the same house, what are my defences if they were to gang up on me? If I take up self-defence classes, what are my chances of winning a fight? I don't know, and I'm afraid to ever find out.


I have reached a dead end. I am done. I do not have the intention of intimidating anyone but I have had enough of being ignored. I am sick of being objectified, I am exhausted, I feel vulnerable in my home — my supposed safe haven. I just want to feel safe in my neighbourhood. I want to be happy about returning home to my family. Just once. I sincerely hope it is not too much to ask for.


I want to emphasise that this is not about race — the last thing I want to read are racist remarks. Don’t make this about any race. I just want to know if there are any other options can I consider. If you connections or solutions, please let me know.


This is a real cry for help, it is truly my last resort. The more shares I get, the higher my chances of it reaching someone who might be able to help, and maybe relevant authorities will start paying attention to my case.


Please, I’m begging you, please share this. It’s been three torturous years, and who knows how many more.

(Editor's Note: Most of the following post was presumably created prior to the recent constitutional challenge, yet seeing that the topic is still being discussed, permission was sought to post it. One expects a lively and civil discussion in the comments, but if that fails to come to pass, it may remain as a bastion for what it was: a call for honesty and moderation in the unfolding dialogue. It also appears that the original author spent the bulk of the post discussing *how* the issue should be argued instead of *what* should be argued, and only towards the end engages with some content to demonstrate the same point. In recognition of the sensitive and emotional nature of this topic, the use of an (amusingly named) throwaway account to fit the author's humor was requested.)

Multiple threads regarding the drama of 377A have sprouted up over the past weekend and they were an interesting read (with popcorn). As Reddit largely leans liberal, much has been done to call out the [faults](https://imgur.com/aE5xCot) and excesses of the Christian minority. That is fair - we should expect scrutiny of both sides equally.

As a BigotedNutjob, however, it is a little concerning to me this hasn't been the case. In my humble opinion, little, if any, attention has been paid to the ""for repeal"" camp (which henceforth will be referred to as the 'LGBT camp' **for the sake of convenience**, and correspondingly the vocal Christian minority which opposes shall be referred to as the 'Christian camp' even though [I fully acknowledge there exists opposition from other creeds/secular opposition.](https://imgur.com/hgojmZx)) A few brave comments have emerged, yes, but by and large they have been censored through downvotes. The net result is slightly (just slightly) ironic: For a movement which claims to support and accept diversity in opinions relating to one's sexual orientation, the same consideration and acceptance is not shown towards dissenting opinions. Essentially, **an echo chamber created from intolerance propagates its support for tolerance.**

Yes, we all come to the issue with our own preconceived biases and notions (for those that argue there is true objectivity, that's for another debate with others). And given such subjective grounds of differing experiences and backgrounds, it might be difficult to find, well, common ground. **Yet in the interest of fairness, the same honesty demanded of the Christian camp should also be applied to those of the LGBT camp.** To that end, it is at the risk of being censored (by downvotes) that I've chosen to compile some things which seem mildly concerning to me. Perhaps by **recognizing and remedying** these issues (as the LGBT camp sees fit), some constructive dialogue may then be possible between the moderate parties of both camps.

The first point I wish to address is the slippery slope fallacy. For those unfamiliar, it is a tactic used to argue that one's opponent is being dishonest because of they conflate what ""could"" happen in the future with what ""will happen"" immediately/in the foreseeable future. Google handily provides us with [one such example](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4EForvVYAA7m9L.jpg).

What might this look like in our context? Well, we first have to establish a trajectory of what such a slope might look like from the perspective of the Christian camp:

Step 1: Repeal of 377A

Step 2: Normalization of homosexual relationships in society

Step 3: Push for LGBT couples to be given the same civil rights in society as heterosexual couples

Step 4: Push for civil union, where LGBT couples are given the same rights but not referred to as married outside of legal purposes (although they can choose to do so if they wish in their own capacity).

Step 5:^(1) [Push for the State to compel churches and/or other religious groups](https://imgur.com/ltldcqE) to officiate and recognize such civil unions as being natural marriages.

^(1) In anticipation of how some say ""That would never happen!"", there is sufficient precedence in [some countries](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/9317447/Gay-Danish-couples-win-right-to-marry-in-church.html) to show that there is. ""But that would never happen in Singapore!"" - perhaps, but how can you personally guarantee the Christian camp that such a scenario would not come to pass?

Of course, there may be more or fewer steps beyond step 5 depending on one's perspective (recognizing a multiplicity of genders, [group marriages](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-40655103), etc.). And for some, they argue that Step 5 doesn't exist; that they'd just be happy with achieving steps 4, 3, 2, or 1.

To that, I would encourage them to be honest (to both themselves and others) about how far they are fighting for. Some who call out the [slippery slope argument](https://imgur.com/76tmjHw) for others do so out of saying that they're only seeking a repeal, and that seems perfectly fair and honest. However, it is also possible (as shown [here](https://imgur.com/7n2KbLO) and [here](https://imgur.com/xXHgNRA)) that some from the same camp are fighting for more: 2, 3, 4, or 5. I'm **not** here to say how far one should fight for, but I'm saying, well, **be honest**. **Don't claim that your ends are 1. when 1. is merely the means to your end of 2, 3, 4, or 5 just because 1. seems less threatening to society than other ends.** Sure, it could be a good form of strategy to deceive/hide one's true intentions (or to suddenly change one's mind and realize that more might be possible if 1. has been won),^(2) but it would not do the LGBT camp much good in terms of how it is perceived - indeed, it would merely prove the accusations of 'give them an inch and they'll take a mile'. Rather, just say you're out for the whole mile and see who stands with you.

^(2) I don't doubt some people do change their minds over time and yearn for more after initial victories, but as evidenced by the few quotes shown, that might not be the case for others.

""But BigotedNutjob, if we're open about what we claim, then we'd just be feeding into the other narrative that the Christian camps actually have!"" is what I would expect to hear. But the Christian camp has already perceived this as the thin end of the wedge and some are prepared to fight the battle up till 4. or 5. if they are pushed. **The keyword here is some: it may be also possible that some within the Christian camp over time are willing to accommodate up to a certain level of acceptance: 1, 2, 3, or 4. If 90% of them are not willing to settle for anything more than 1., then sure, it's a tough battle. But if 90% of them** ***are*** **willing to settle for 3., and you as an individual (and the movement itself) are honest about your/its end being 3., then would not a dialogue and lasting compromise be possible?**

""But I don't want my marriage to be seen as *just* a civil union with all the same rights, I want the same societal acceptance that hetereosexual couples have when they can say they're married and not just 'civilly united'!"" is what I would also expect to hear for those looking for 5. as the ends. **Given that many within the LGBT camp are not religious, though, it is beyond my feeble mind's ability to comprehend why they would want a religious body they don't support to marry them before a God they don't believe so that others would see their marriage as 'normal'. Indeed, there's nothing preventing an LGBT couple from introducing themselves to friends and family as legally married in the eyes of the State at step 4.** with *all* the associated civil benefits which they would presumably have, so what's wrong with that?

As a final thought on this, it would be heartening to see some of the [vaunted bravery](https://imgur.com/fmASLzr) displayed. It is possible that moderates (those who seek up to 3 or 4, for example), may be cowed into silence or fear being seen as ""supporters of inequality"" (to paraphrase one of the above screenshots) when their more outspoken members of the community push for 5 and nothing less. But if someone might start up a [change.org](https://change.org/) or something accountable where moderate members of the LGBT camp can say ""Yes, I am only fighting for up till 1, or 2/3/4 and I *would not* support anything more than that"", that would be a refreshing display of honesty to the Christian camp, and perhaps may render dialogue between interested parties possible.

On the second point, which is one's right to opinion (and frequently lapses into arguments about how Singapore is a secular State and so the Church and State should be separated). It is of some concern that some are linking the strength of arguments from the Christian camp to their right of expressing it. Such expression can take the form of actual political votes or merely [change.org](https://change.org/) opinions, and so it would sound something like ""[Their arguments suck](https://imgur.com/aURj7Sj), so they don't deserve the right to express it."".

Be that as it may (for we all judge arguments differently), **call me crazy, but I am of the opinion that people should be allowed to express their opinions even if their argument is not something which you disagree with.** Just because you disagree with it does not mean it is wrong - it **could** be wrong, but it doesn't **automatically** make it wrong. [And even if it is, who are you to deny others the right to be wrong?](https://imgur.com/8goOxzz)

""But them being wrong affects my life!"". Sure, but it's also possible that from their point of view your arguments aren't correct, and yet you would not wish them to censor or remove your ability to voice it. One doesn't have to be religious to remember the Golden Rule of doing unto others as you'd wish them to do to you. **And if the other side fails to uphold that level of charity, surely you could be the better person, the bigger man or woman, and teach them a lesson in morals or two by taking the higher road.**

Insofar as many call for separation of church and state without much clarity of what they're talking about (is it protecting the state from the church or the church from the state?), it is timely to remember that others should be allowed to vote or express their opinions according to their conscience. There are undoubtedly consequences for doing so, but whether someone temporarily withholds their religious belief (and/or does not vote according to their conscience) is for them to decide, not you.

A better option [suggested by others](https://imgur.com/5Jw0FIx) more knowledgeable than I would be to do as some have called: Utilize alternative sources of online media (Pinknews, personal blogs, etc) to argue your case and advance your cause. If you really believe that most humans are able to make the ""right"" choice given sufficient information and persuasion, then take the time and effort to learn, in-depth, what existing inhibitions the Christian camp and vast [majority of non-Christians](https://imgur.com/8XoF7JN) may have towards your stance (whatever it is). And seek to persuade, and change their opinions, instead of mudslinging your opposition and [trying to censor their opinions by mocking them](https://imgur.com/BI8jTip). If indeed your persuasion is successful and the majority of people are convinced of the justness of your cause,^(3) [then a public referendum (or even public surveys) would reflect that in the future.](https://imgur.com/3EfTWwQ)

^(3) On a semi-related note, I find it a little disheartening that [an atheist who expressed his opposition was heavily downvoted and later deleted his original post - although fragments of his post can be seen in subsequent replies.](https://imgur.com/2GXHT8h) If anything, his post should have been upvoted so that others might take part in the debate as well and try to convince him. Of course, it is not for me to suggest how it looks - perhaps like one's trying to hide what goes against the herd/sheep mentality that 'only Christians are the 'bad guys' we have to fight, and everyone else is actually on our side?' - so maybe, y'know, it was a genuine, honest mistake. Maybe the downvoters thought they were upvoting him or something?

**Let people express their opinions and vote according to their consciences, and let the chips fall where they may. If successful, it would prove that the majority agree with your stance, and that you have been** [**successful in persuading them (which is indeed not impossible).**](https://imgur.com/FbYjp5T) **Would not that be a good, clean and well-earned victory?**

My final point consists of a few minor sub-points:

For those who argue that homosexual behaviour is seen in nature, I don't deny that. And so the argument goes: ""It's seen in nature, so that means it's natural and alright for societies to have."" Sure, but there's some evidence [beastility is also observed in nature](https://medium.com/@kimaniakerr/if-bestiality-isnt-normal-it-might-be-natural-571b780e19ef). If you applied the same logic then, you might also concede that it should be allowed in society. ""But animals might suffer and they can't consent!"" But how would *you* know whether they indeed suffer and can't [consent?](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/52o9vq/if_animals_consent_to_sex_with_the_same_species/) (not to mention abuse and coercion has the potential to happen in any relationship). [""But it doesn't affect me!""](https://imgur.com/E5nD5vH) Well, going by the logic of 'just because it doesn't affect me doesn't mean I shouldn't stop oppressing others by my inaction', that shouldn't be an excuse not to stop oppression and kink-shaming for zoophiles. **Is it not their right, as humans, to bang what they'd prefer to bang as well?** [Indeed, there are real people who suffer from this oppression as well.](http://freshgrads.sg/index.php/articles/weird-stuff/2400-man-who-likes-to-have-sex-with-his-male-dog-reveals-his-life-as-a-zoophile)

In the interest of using a [similar argument which has been made](https://imgur.com/w4kmfKl), let's see what this might look like if adapted for [Section 377B (laws against beastility)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871?ProvIds=P4XVI-P4_375-.#pr377B-):

""Assuming you aren't just baiting, 377B as it stands infringes upon rights of certain citizens against our constitutional values and is only there is a vestige of colonial, Christian influenced and centric law. As it stands what we have is not a situation of equality, with said law dictating that zoophilias can't have sex, makes it impossible for zoophilias to marry their animals as they wish or adopt etc. That's why arguing to maintain the status quo is wrong, because the current status quo is one that is already unequal. To maintain it would be to continue imposing Abrahamic-centric religious values upon people of what is supposed to be a secular state.

Furthermore, zoophobes have little right to claim that legalising zoophilic practices will cause the corruption of institutions like 'love' and 'marriage'. 'Love' and 'marriage' are, after all, not concepts created or owned by Abrahamic religions. They are merely legal/social constructs and as such interpreting such institutions through a zoophobic lens as many opponents of zoophilia rights is wrong. Rather the state should treat these people with an accepting and loving lens, with all zoophiles granted equal rights to love and marry and do what they do without institutional discrimination originating from a less enlightened past.

So even though there aren't quite victims of active persecution in Singapore, people who identify as zoophiles here may perhaps rightfully feel as though they are victims of an oppressive law preventing them from achieving equality.""

If the above sounds good to you, then great! You're fairly applying the same logic to other forms of discrimination that real people also suffer from, and you should also support efforts to repeal 377B for the sake of others even if you're not affected [(like in the United States)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_bestiality_in_the_United_States#Pro-zoophilia_organizations_in_the_United_States). If instead you're like 'heck nah, only 377A should be repealed because I don't like people fucking animals' then…well…

1.  Them doing it with animals doesn't affect you. 

2. Others are affected by laws like this being in place.

3. Maybe it is good to cast aside one's own prejudices in the face of [real suffering suffered by others](https://www.thelocal.de/20130201/47711).

4. Just because it might be a small minority doesn't mean the human rights of sexual minorities should be trampled upon by the majority

5. Think of how progressive ^(4) it would be if it was repealed - it's 2018 already! What are we in, the Middle Ages?

^(4) Some of you will say 'but that's not progressive!' But who decides what is progressive or regressive - is it only progressive if it agrees with your stance?

At the very least, it is good to consider how many ""unnatural"" or ""immoral"" sexual behaviours (necrophilia, pedophilia, etc) we perceive [have been observed in nature or other human societies as well.](http://the-singapore-lgbt-encyclopaedia.wikia.com/wiki/Zoophilia) So in the name of *equality* and *tolerance* and *acceptance* of diversity for *all* sexual orientations and preferences, **someone who is applying the naturalistic logic of 'it's natural so it should be allowed' should fairly apply it to other cases as well. Or they could pick and choose what they wish to apply it to (justifying on the basis of other beliefs/concerns such as harm, consent, etc), but then they should also be honest and render that same benefit to their opponents (justifying on other beliefs which they might not share/care for) which they often accuse of 'cherry-picking'.**

Again, I'm not making the argument for 377A and 377B to be repealed or kept. I'm just contrasting them side by side with this example to show how there's cherry-picking on both sides about what they wish to repeal (LGBT) and what they wish to emphasize/follow (for the Christian camp). It's been rationalized to sound like it's 'common sense', but honesty is always a good starting point for dialogue to begin from. And it's not too difficult to re-frame such arguments for other ""deviant"" sexual behaviours as well, so other oppressed individuals who wish to do so can adopt the same format if they feel they're also being unfairly discriminated against by institutions and society.

For those that argue [those opposing homosexual](https://imgur.com/EpupKOU) [behaviour are closeted homosexuals](https://imgur.com/zkiHeoF), I'd ask you to consider the same logic: Do you oppose beastility or pedophilia? Oh, you do? That means you must be a secret goat-fucker/loli-lover, or you secretly want to. And stop denying that you don't desire that, you're just projecting and/or suppressing your subconscious desires.

See what I mean? Sure, there are certainly a few exceptions to the norm when individuals opposed to something actually have inclinations towards it, but most would be willing to reconsider their positions if given statistics that demonstrate most people AREN'T actually what they say they are (and that we're all actually lying to each other about who we are). Otherwise the cry of ""not all LGBT people are like that!"" rings a bit hollow when you're tarring all opposition with the same brush.

Finally, for those that argue the Christian church has NOT engaged the LGBT community and [simultaneously slammed](https://imgur.com/T4Lz0Fi) the [TrueLove.is](https://truelove.is/) movement for doing so, you can't have your cake and eat it. **The** [**TrueLove.is**](https://truelove.is/) **movement has indeed tried to engage a small section of the LGBT community - specifically LGBT Christians struggling to reconcile their faith and orientation/desires. It might not be done in the way you wish it to be done, but it seems a little dishonest to say that something is not being done and then saying that it's being done badly**: Either accept that nothing's being done, or give credit where credit is due when something is being done, and then criticize it as you will. **Or give constructive comments on how you think it could be improved - it might actually be more helpful than just slamming what you dislike about it.****^(5)** 

On a related note, I have to confess that my knowledge of events in the LGBT camp is painfully limited, and so comments showing how the moderate section of the LGBT camp is attempting to build bridges with opposing camps as well - if there are indeed any at present - would be appreciated. [Perhaps then these bridges will lead to a more fruitful conversation even if complete agreement may not be possible, and those on the fence could see the willingness to dialogue.](https://imgur.com/E9UJDPL)

^(5) Somehow the fury with which the Truelove.is movement is slammed for dissipates when asked to consider how they might contribute to helping the movement better reach out to their Christian compatriots. Perhaps that's just normal apathy - and not too different from the same criticisms leveled at the Christian camp.

As a [recent quote](https://imgur.com/1lmWl9y) has been quite popular in several posts, I would like to end with a quote as well in response to [comments about 'tyranny of the majority'](https://imgur.com/5e5SBEy) (which is too long to go into here): 

""**One of the most banal commonplaces which get repeated against the elective system of forming State organs is the following: that in it numbers decide everything, and that the opinions of any idiot who knows how to write (or in some countries even of an illiterate) have exactly the same weight in determining the political course of the State as the opinions of somebody who devotes his best energies to the State and the nation, etc.** But the fact is that it is not true, in any sense, that numbers decide everything, nor that the opinions of all electors are of ""exactly"" equal weight. Numbers, in this case too, are simply an instrumental value, giving a measure and a relation and nothing more. 

And what then is measured? What is measured is precisely the effectiveness, and the expansive and persuasive capacity, of the opinions of a few individuals, the active minorities, the elites, the avant-gardes, etc. - i.e. their rationality, historicity or concrete functionality. Which means it is untrue that all individual opinions have ""exactly"" equal weight. Ideas and opinions are not spontaneously ""born"" in each individual brain: they have had a centre of formation, of irradiation, of dissemination, of persuasion - a group of men, or a single individual even, which has developed them and presented them in the political form of the current reality. The counting of ""votes"" is the final ceremony of a long process, in which it is precisely those who devote their best energies to the State and the nation (when such as they are) who carry the greatest weight. If this hypothetical group of worthy men, notwithstanding the boundless material power which they possess, do not have the consent of the majority, they must be judged either as inept, of as not representative of ""national"" interests - which cannot help being decisive in inflecting the national will in one direction rather than another.

**""Unfortunately"" everyone tends to confound his own ""private interest"" with that of the nation, and hence to find it ""dreadful"", etc. that it should be the ""law of numbers"" which decides; it is better of course to become an elite by decree. Thus it is not a question of the people ""who have the brains"" feeling that they are being reduced to the level of the lowest illiterate, but rather one of people who think they are the ones with the brains wanting to take away from the ""man in the street"" even that tiniest fraction of power of decision over which the course of national life which he possesses.""**

In many threads observed, it is often the case that the minority (which at present happens to be the LGBT camp) argues that laws should not be made based on majority rule. In other words, [the sample of Singapore's population in past surveys are right except when the LGBT camp says so](https://imgur.com/AM7nlRG) because they have the moral high ground and access to some sole universal truth. A little like being *enlightened* 'moral elites', if you will - again, not too different from the criticisms leveled at leaders in the Christian camp. But pushing that line of thought comes dangerously close to trying to remove the rights of others - religious and non-religious Singaporeans who stand opposed to them - to determine what they wish the course of national life should take. 

So *maybe*, just *maybe*, the LGBT camp could consider this one crazy idea: Dialogue with those that might oppose them, persuade those apathetic/on the fence at present and wait to see how effective one's efforts have been. Then if a popular vote or survey comes up in the future, let everyone freely vote according to their beliefs and conscience, and let the chips fall where they may. **And please, for the sake of honesty, if (or when) the majority vote starts to swing towards the LGBT camp, find a bit of humility to remember the past when this wasn't the case and don't start claiming 'the will of the people is now right because they're following what** ***I*** **believe in.'** 

&amp;#x200B;

But, y'know, what do I know? After all, I'm just a BigotedNutjob.

Q&amp;A

Q1: Why are you attacking the LGBT camp and not pointing out the flaws of the Christian camp?

A1: As mentioned in the first couple of paragraphs, I think other Redditors have done an excellent job for the latter, and I trust they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Disorganization and a little suppression seem to inhibit efforts necessary for the former camp to understand some concerns held by others on here, so in the interest of the LGBT camp, I've spent a bit of time compiling them so that they can consider how best they might wish to tackle it. Of course, it's perfectly possible to ignore everything I just said because I'm a BigotedNutjob, but others presumably from the same camp have already called for a more measured response, so perhaps they should heed the calls of their compatriots as well.

Besides, seeing this as an 'attack' stems from a defensive mindset/siege mentality. Rather, it should be seen as constructive criticism: [Some problems identified](https://imgur.com/3EfTWwQ), some solutions proposed (be publicly honest about actual ends, respect the rights of others to disagree with you/be wrong and try to be the better party in discussions). If you wish to devise another solution, go ahead. If you wish to ignore everything, go ahead as well. Both camps are free to learn or ignore (possibly at their peril, possibly not) the lessons pointed out by others and adapt accordingly. Then it's up to how well they band together and organize themselves to influence societal discourse. And by some miracle if they are able to find common ground - to agree to disagree - then that would be good.

Q2: Why did you type this?

A2: I see some calls for dialogue from what I presume to be the LGBT camp as shown in some of the above screenshots, but the general mood of posters seems to be acerbic. With such an attitude, I'm not sure how serious the desire for dialogue and understanding is, or whether any actually stem from/exist within their camp. If there isn't, then it would be good to encourage it rather than calling for all out cultural war. Certainly there are moderates and hardliners/extremists on both sides - outside of dialogue and understanding, I do not see how one can avoid an inevitable polarization of society.

And that would be a shame: To see some labelled as ""non-Singaporean"" or ""anti-Singaporean"" when they do not hold the same opinions as others. One's national identity should rightly be kept out of this discussion so that such a future might not come to pass.

Q3: Are you going to reply to every comment and/or engage in a dialogue?

A3: Heck no, we've all got our own lives to lead. I'm just one of the anonymous BigotedNutjob(s) which *some* (thankfully not all) in the LGBT camp enjoys dissing (sometimes). Hence the name to reflect my *bigoted*, *crackpot* and *utterly* *unreasonable* opinions. This is just a post to summarize an under-reported side of past Reddit discussion, scrutinize one side a little bit and say ""Alright, have fun, best of luck talking it out!"". Oh, and also to encourage the moderates from both camps (as well as the non-religious moderates) that they're not alone. As far as bridges can be built, then, between major leaders (and their followers) of each camp involved, I don't see why we should reduce ourselves to a muddy war.

I'm very concerned about the record heatwaves being set every year, the record wildfires, the record annual temperatures, etc. I feel like the Earth is headed towards a fucking environmental disaster, all because of political inaction.

As an individual, I bring a tumbler wherever I go (even to McDonald's) to reduce consumption of plastic straws and paper cups. I bring reusable grocery bags to the supermarket - if I forget, I either hold the item in my hand or put it in my backpack. I admit I do use the a/c every night and I drive - but then again change is not an all or nothing thing.

But as an individual, sometimes it feels so hopeless. When I pack my groceries in my reusable grocery bag, I see dozens of other shoppers with half a dozen plastic bags each, some holding only one item. To my mind, the most effective way of reducing plastic bag consumption is to charge for it through legislation - but the government has said it doesn't want to do that (fucking dumbass decision in my opinion). When I read the news, I read about Trump rolling back environmental protections and regulations... in the world's largest economy. So on and so forth.

About 30 mins ago, I was harassed by this Indian guy outside the 7 Eleven on North Bridge Road. He claims that I put my hand out and was like ""Why did you call me over?"". I said that I did not put my hand out to call anyone over. He said ""Why are you here?"" and I told him I am waiting for a taxi, but so far they have all been hired, hence why I am saying that I didn't put my hand out. He then asked me where I'm from, and I told him KL. He told me to earn my money and fuck off from Singapore. I told him that that was my plan. 

Then he continued to harass me again asking me why I put my hand out when there were no taxis. He was adamant that I did so to call him over. I did not put my hand out at all. 

He told me that I had 2 mins to leave or he would punch me. I didn't leave (because I was waiting for a taxi). He came up to me again and warned me once more. At first I was a little afraid, because I didn't want to get into a fight. But after his constant harassment, I got so fed up that I started talking back to him. Just as he told me the second time to leave in 2mins, a taxi came and it was GREEN. I stopped the cab, got in, and gave him the finger.

Our unique situation as citizen soldiers instead of career soldiers allows the state a low cost armed force   

Historically, the Greeks and the Romans relied on such citizen soldiers to defend their lands and also to invade and acquire other lands. The citizen farmer when faced with the threat of war has no choice but to fight for his country because he owns actual property, a farm, in which his means of livelihood to sustain him and his family is dependent on. 

Come present day Singapore. The average citizen soldier owns a 99 year leasehold strata title. He does not own any immovable means of production since he is usually a white or blue collared individual exchanging labour for pay. Actual freehold landownership is priced out of his reach and accumulated by the few elites. 

Why then in times of war should he risk his life and fight for a country in which he has no ownership, to protect the immovable properties of the few elites? What’s stopping him from relocating the family unit to another country? 

Especially when the elites themselves are likely not to stay and fight as they usually also own overseas properties which they can escape to, why should landless Singaporean males act as poorly compensated security guards fighting to preserve the properties of those very likely absentee elites?

408,singapore,137989,Perceptions between the different classes or social hierarchy appear to be different from reality. Which is rather concerning.,9pg06l,Ignitisvermillion,1539918685,25,1,"Good day everyone,  
As you know, there has been a recent large amount of discussions between the population or at least those that are technologically inclined where they have watched the video from CNA Insider conducted by Dr Janil Puthucheary, chairman of [OnePeople.sg](https://OnePeople.sg). Where he brought people from different backgrounds to speak to each other and inherently judge one another base on their class. Although one may be able to criticize the study statistically due to it being selection bias, small sample size, potential issue with the framing of the study to push a pre-written narrative, failure to account for missing participants etc etc. One thing that can't be denied is that it is seen as an issue with Singapore today.

&amp;#x200B;

What constitutes as an elitist?

1)Common perception of people among the common folk as well as students today appear to be those that come from very good schools. Your usual HCI,RI,ACSI etc etc. Which is commonly associated with having a larger significant proportion of their students attaining the top of the bell-curve aka they get all the As.   
2)What also constitutes as elitist according to some people is the income level of a person also know as Socio-Economic Status ( SES ) as people like to call it.  
Some may wonder what happens if it is a Poor SES student in RI,HCI or ACSI? Are they constituted as an elitist? But then one definition of the word is being self-contradictory with the other definition people like to go by.   


General consensus is that elitists is something where a person sees himself as a higher being within the society hierarchy. It is flexible in its meaning where you can see it being thrown anywhere and everywhere as long as there are rankings.

&amp;#x200B;

It is inherently a mentality in my view. Not something that is attached to a person simply because he/she gets the lucky draw of being born in a blessed family. Or is working hard in school for a better future entering an elite school to be part of the 20% poor-to-rich fluidity in the country.

&amp;#x200B;

Nuture vs Nature?

In the basic studies between people, we judge a person within 7 seconds. The entire impression of you is formed within another person's mind. It is a biological mechanical tool, it helps us determine if the person is somebody we would like to be associated with as well as see any foreseeable benefits of us being associated with such person. It is the simple reason why you work Over-Time for your boss, you see not losing your job and getting a promotion being of importance hence you will need to be good in your boss's eyes. The mechanical tool of judging is as such.  


However, that is when elitism enters, because such tool is being used commonly, it simply produces data for the person to interpret. This person is holding an iPhone X, he has a high probability of being wealthy in a sense. Your child points out that other children's parents are able to fetch them with their fancy Audi and it sinks in him/her that they are not as well-off as the rest. Or maybe you notice your friends posting on Instagram that they are studying very hard, you change your perception of what you know about them and take note that they are publicizing they are working hard.  


These are all just data to the mind and conclusions it makes up.  


Streaming, is it necessary?  


Streaming has been a rather hot-topic especially for parents in Singapore's school system. It dictates to a significant probability where your child will end up for the next 4 years. Breaking up the cohort into streams based on higher level of content knowledge and speed of studies.   


The short answer is. Yes it is necessary.

As you all know, Singapore has no natural resources, we only have people. If MOE were to handicap the capable and hardworking so as to play by the slowest among society, we will be wasting potential talents as well as hindering competitiveness of society when we are to fight against other countries. Imagine if streaming was scrapped, in an alternate reality where everything everybody learns is the same. The same breadth, same speed and same time. If we were to play by the slowest denominator of the cohort imagine only studying Algebra by lets say... Primary 4. Or learning Hypothesis Testing only in University. Or even maybe learning the basics of chemical bonds at age 18. If you compare this against other countries, it may not seem as bad. But other countries have other sources of revenue. We have mainly our workforce as well as our net-exports to drive our economy. We will essentially be losing around 30-40% of our economy if our workforce is deemed sub-par with the world. Please note these are rough estimates and not representative of actual data because it is difficult to tell how much we will actually lose. Until we actually do lose it. Which is something none of us would like.  


Back to the main point,there are speculations by people that streaming causes elitism. Yes it is a fact it does contribute to it. Imagine if you were to win a competition, you would be given first prize as well as trophies and all of the glory that is associated with it. Normally, you would of course believe you are better than others, because you have been recognized and accorded as such by the people authorized to do so. Streaming essentially does this. It gives people their 'class' in a sense. It tells them how good or bad they are. That is a fact and can't be sugar-coated by teachers or otherwise. It is a label. Same as entering a good school, an elite school, top class etc etc. They are all labels. It may be disappointing to see that how we treat others is based on these labels and not essentially based on who they are as a person. Then again, drawing back to the point supra (above). We judge people. These labels help make that judging easier.   


If you were to spot a person with piercings as well as tattoos all over their face and body. What will you inherently conclude? That he is a gangster? That he has a criminal record?  


Those conclusions are reasonable. People often times who want to argue for the sake of arguing will say 'not all' people with tattoos are gangsters. They are of course making statement against blanket statements about tattoos being equivalent to gangsters. They in that sense are technically correct. But they do not acknowledge that there is a fair to reasonable chance that a person with tattoos and piercings are in fact more likely to be gangsters versus somebody with a proper trimmed haircut and looks like an average school student. Which is why people come to these conclusions.  


These labels come with information, about the general population of that label and characteristics that they are more than likely to have. 

&amp;#x200B;

Which is why we come to this, where perception between the classes are different from reality. Nothing in this world is absolute when it comes to data or blanket statements. That is the beauty of humanity. We are all different, with different experience, upbringing and lives. We move and operate on our own moral compass and passion in life.   


So is this nurture or nature? To answer that question, it is best we look over our borders. A very good counter to the nurture vs nature argument is Japan. If you have ever been to Japan and spoken to Japanese locals. They are taught from a very young age that they are to respect every job. From construction workers, to cleaners, to people who do dishwashing. Respecting them is ingrained in their society because they know, those that benefit to live a good life has done so on the backs of others. They should not belittle those that contribute to society so others can prosper. As without a bottom, there can be no top.  


Now that we know to relative degree that it is not nature but nurture, you may wonder if we can do the same as Japan? Seems like a reasonable conclusion to make. If it works for others why not have it work for us? The issue with this is perception and attitude. These are two values that span across generations. We may be able to implement such a change within our education system. The change will probably take several decades, should it succeed we will be rid of this problem. But it does not solve the issue today, or tomorrow, or the next.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the ways maybe we can solve this in the short term is social-penalizing of such attitudes. Where if you hear somebody make a statement like ""People who take public transports are peasants"" (reference to you know what), then social-penalizing and telling off will be good so that people who have begun to develop such mentalities know that it is wrong. But of course this will require majority of the people to participate, even those who believe they themselves are elite to peer-check on other elites among them, which is highly unlikely unless they have the view of society as a whole in consideration knowing it is better for the country as a whole that this stops before it fragments everything.

&amp;#x200B;

So if we judge people based on labels. Where it was obvious during the exchange between the IP student ant the NT student. How do we make these impressions go away?  


For the foreseeable short term future, you can't. At least not entirely. Remember previously concluded that biologically we want to be together with others who are like us. It is easier to relate, easier to communicate and easier to empathize. The statement that the top does not empathize with the bottom is true. As much as some people at the top may like to disagree, it is true (Unless you came from both). You will only FREELY \*huge emphasis\* hang around people of similar background simply because it is easier. Lesser barriers to entry. Path of least resistance.  A simple question will be the following:  
""Do you hang around people with Tattoos?""  
""Do you hang around with people who owns a sports car?""

""Do you hang around people who lives in 2-room HDB flats?""  
""Do you hang around with the uncle you see by the void deck smoking?""

...

""Why not?""

We hang around people who are easier to relate. It prevents social awkwardness. Like in the video where the NT student says it is difficult to speak to people of other streams due to the nature of which the language is spoken, making it difficult for him to keep up.

&amp;#x200B;

So now we know why people don't speak to one another. What can we do about it? The best thing you can do. Which I can't strongly encourage is...  


""Don't be a prick""

&amp;#x200B;

Even if the guy with tattoos is by the void deck, or the sports car driver coming to pick up their children, or you see the family from the 2-room flat at the hawker centre, even the uncle by the void deck smoking, be nice. Be friendly. Be proper.

&amp;#x200B;

It does no good to society as well as people's perception of you if you are smiling one moment while gossiping about how ""he/she is from X neighbourhood school and is very bad hence he/she must be inherently bad as well"" or during Chinese New Year, ""Wah your child only got 180 for PSLE? Mine got 257!"" or ""Why you go university study X? Why never study Law or Medicine!"".

&amp;#x200B;

Don't belittle others. Everybody is just trying to make their way through life. Nobody likes difficult people. Singapore is already counted as a utopia by many and I sincerely believe we have enough problems on our hands \*cough\* crooked bridge \*cough\* from external sources. We don't need more trouble from ourselves.

  
It is still very heartwarming to see times where we help each other out when needed. In situations where we are under threat or harm we tend to throw all these social issues out the window and band together as one. Which is one thing I like about our society, we know how to prioritize.

This week/month is a deeply saddening one for the arts/jazz community of Singapore. It's just been announced that Blu Jaz Cafe, one of the last standing venues for jazz, poetry slam, stand-up and amateur music community development will be having their Public Entertainment License taken away. This means no more live music, no more live performances etc. It will essentially become just any other bar.   


This is following a series of many other such jazz bars closing down within close proximity of each other. 2 years ago, an amateur or professional musician who wanted to practice at a jam session could do so at B28, Artistry Cafe, Sing Jazz Club and Blu Jaz. Plenty of choices. That slowly reduced to only Blu Jaz. Every jam session at those other venues basically had to relocated to Blu Jaz. As a musician delving into jazz, jam sessions were a crucial part of the week for me to not only improve my craft, but also to engage with other jazz enthusiasts.  


After this month, there may no longer be a venue that holds jam sessions anymore. While I have been mainly talking about the music side of things, it is important to note that this is part of a bigger movement that is, to me, the reason why art in Singapore is being prevented from growth. Personally, I think we are in a fantastic time for creating Singaporean art. From what I can see, we are hungry for local content. But in any artistic community, there needs to exist platforms and opportunities for such art to be created.   


The importance of such casual venues cannot be overstated. The fact is that the rates of Singapore's performance venues, say the Esplanade, is actually greater than our competition, say New York or London. (Don't have a link to a stat for this, but I heard Huzir Sulaiman of Checkpoint Theatre mention this during a panel discussion in regards to the Arts Landscape of Singapore just a few days ago).   


As an Artist, no matter where in the world you are, it will feel like an uphill battle. In Singapore, however, it feels more like trying to walk up a vertical wall. To throw in some statistics, the arts industry here is roughly twice as educated as the national median, yet our median pay is lower than the national average. Which is fine! Most of us accept the fact that we will adopt ""struggling to make ends meet"" not just temporarily, but as an entire lifestyle. All we want is to have adequate platforms to present and develop our art without having to be born from a rich family.   


As an example, some of the biggest names in the jazz scene of Singapore has been running something called We Love Jazz SG. They've done some fantastic fantastic things in growing the community and really reaching out to audiences. However, they are about to shut down since they have been running on at least $20,000 in debt. This is despite being registered as a charity organisation and receiving grants and donations. The costs of doing art in Singapore, especially if you are less commercial (as compared to MBS theatre shows for example) is quite unbearable. The founders of WLJ  SG have been sustaining this venture from their own personal funds, but of course no matter how passionate we are, in the end money matters.  


Now, why do I say I feel hopeless? I really don't want this to be a ""fuck the gahmen"" ranty post so I will try my best to be objective. Firstly, the circumstances surrounding the shutting down of Blu Jaz's live music simply feels like the ones who made the decision just don't care about how this affects the arts scene. So the basis of the removal is that the newly built condo opposite the road made noise complaints. Fair enough. In other countries, say Germany and London (since I will be giving anecdotal accounts, I apologize in advance for the lack of more solid research to back my opinions), if noise is an issue. There will be a process to solving this because those countries recognize the importance of arts and culture.   


You will find that many live entertainment bars in these areas that are near residences may, for example, end live music very strictly at 12am. They might try to incorporate sound proofing. This is because there is a process of communication, instead of a black-and-white ""it's too loud"", there are steps taken to resolve the issue in a way that benefits everyone. In the case of Blu Jaz, there's no ""Stop the music at 12am or 10pm"". Nope, not even music at 2pm is ok now. There's now ""maybe let's explore a probation month to allow time for sound proofing, since the complaints are from the other side of the road after all"". Nope. It's a direct removal of the license with very little warning, and just like that we lose one of our last standing locations for so many great arts activities.   


Now I'm sure the same would not happen if the noise complaint was made about Esplanade instead. Why is this so? My personal belief is that it is because our policy makers look at the Arts in an overly tangible and ""let's see what the numbers say"" manner. Random stat: in 2013 the total operating receipts in the Arts of Singapore amounted to roughly 7 billion SGD. What this means is that niche genres such as Jazz is ultimately just a rounding off error. Will that 7 billion change significantly the following year, if an important jazz bar is closed down? Probably not. So if you look at the numbers you can say, ""well arts is still doing great!""  


But perhaps it is the very intangibility of arts and culture, and the fact that it is beyond what numbers can tell us, that makes it so important to Singapore. Ever thought of what the Singaporean identity is? And this is why I feel hopeless. I don't foresee this to change. The public complains loudest about foreigners and how much ministers are paid. Arts practitioners are a very tiny community in Singapore, so our voice doesn't get heard as much amidst the complaints of MRT breaking down and ""foreigners stealing our jobs"". PAP won't talk about the arts in their rallies, and neither will the opposition. I feel very useless as an individual because I can't seem to create the slightest change in the very thing that drives my being.   


In fact, if this was brought up in front of the vocal online public, chances are that we will only get more hate. Cause they'll soon point out that many of the key leaders in Singapore's arts scene are foreigners (personally I consider most of them local already, and if anything they do more for Singapore than many Singaporeans). But why do you think there are so many foreigners? It's because we don't have the adequate environment for local talent to grow sufficiently, and in the end it's really just a vicious cycle. Today, I just asked a prominent local musician (who came from overseas many many years ago) if she would like to do an interview in regards to the jazz scene. First thing she said was that I should probably get a Singaporean instead. I feel very ashamed and sad when I heard that. I myself came from China, and when I was in school I was bullied a lot. One of my deepest memories is still this moment when I was being called ""China Monkey"" and prodded and provoked till I lashed out... which probably was the reaction they wanted to prove them right that I'm an uncultured, barbaric China Monkey.  


Ok I've been ranting a lot. But I love Singapore and I don't want to just rant and not try to offer anything. As hopeless as I feel, I will still do my best to keep fighting for our arts scene. So what can we do to change this? To be honest, I don't think I have enough experience and knowledge to answer this adequately. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable will be able to expand more on this.  


First, from my own side, I guess I need to try and be more vocal about such issues, try and reach out to the public more. Hence making this post in the first place. Sometimes we tend to be caught in our own bubble of art making.  


More push towards unionised support. There have been some advancements in this over the past few years, but it is definitely not enough. The whole Blu Jaz thing is because we don't have an official body to fight such issues for us. To the policy maker, it probably looks like ""Condominium with rich residents VS random noisy bar"", instead of what the bar actually represents -- one of the last stands of the jazz community. We need lawyers who can look at the fine print and argue it out with the governing boards to seek for solutions that aim for a mutually beneficial solution, not black and white ones that completely neglect one side of the argument.   


While there was the formation of the Musician's Guild and NAC is also currently working on a sort of union for freelancers (albeit targeted at coaches and instructers only), it's definitely not enough because the numbers are too different. Such a thing would only be effective if pushed by the government themselves, if they care enough about the development and survival of arts. Everytime I see a presentation by NAC, they love to emphasise how much money the government puts into arts. While it is fantastic that we have great financial support, I believe the support is going to a lot of the wrong places. Most of the spending comes in the form of architecture. We seriously have some fantastic arts venues, such as the Esplanade. But spending on architecture will only benefit the local arts scene so much. If anything, Esplanade is an extremely difficult venue for local artists to perform in due to the exhorbitant costs. A non-profit organisation (if you are an individual artist or group without an organisation, it's even more) has to pay around 2 to 3 thousand for one night in the Esplanade Recital Studio, which holds around 200 people. Of course, the top arts groups in Singapore will still profit from this, but any mid-tier group/artist will have troubles even breaking even.  


And that's the thing. I believe one way to seriously improve the arts scene is the creation of more opportunities for amateur/semi-pro artists. We need venues that didn't cost hundreds of millions to build and charge rates that pose a huge barrier of entry for any artist. Most artists who do hold concerts and such apply for grants from NAC to cover costs, but I believe this can result in a very skewed showcase of personalities. (The kind of proposals that would be accepted are... let's say, almost formulaic. A fantastic artist who perhaps does not command the strongest English or proposal writing skills is heavily disadvantaged, which should not be the case)  


So yes, I think my whole rant starting with Blu Jaz boils down to barrier to entry. The closing down of Blu Jaz's music signifies a larger change in terms of increasing barriers to entry. This skews the kind of audiences that participate in the arts, and is ultimately a lose-lose situation for both the audience and the artist.   


To end off, I shall use a personal anecdote as an example of how this ""barrier to entry"" affects things in my life. If I were to fly to Shanghai right now, I would immediately be able to perform in a bar at night (of course I have some connections lah) and have a healthy audience of both fans/friends and new audiences. In Singapore, if I want to perform, it will take me perhaps 2 months of planning (I'm not a vocalist, so it will be less straightforward). In the Shanghai scenario, the bars would be happy to have me and I would be paid an honorarium and probably in free drinks too. In Singapore, I will have to spend a few days on my excel sheets figuring out how much money I will stand to lose... Yes, performing here often costs the performer more than whatever each individual audience is spending. Blu Jaz has been a great venue for performance and they offer opportunities such as ""performers can book the private floors for free as long as the audiences buy XXX amount in drinks, they can choose to charge entry fees as well to pay Blu Jaz afterwards if the drinks sales don't meet the number"".

Maybe it's a result of the political/social culture which actively discourages advocacy, activism, etc. which paints activists and advocates for various causes in a negative light. Maybe it's ""Asian values"" that we should keep a low profile and not ""stir shit"". I don't know.

But even if you disagree with the cause, why are we not more supportive of the fact that there are people who are willing to fight for what they believe in? Why are we so cynical and eager to paint them with the broad brush of ""SJWism""? I think it's admirable, and healthy even, that they feel strongly enough about a cause to do something about it, beyond bitching about it on Facebook/Twitter/Reddit.

And I think it's something that everyone should strive towards. We may not agree on a cause, but do we really want to be the kind of society that sits back and do nothing about our grievances except post online? Do we really have that collective ironclad faith in the competency and infallibility of our political leaders, to give them unchecked power to do what they want?

I know this comes off as a rant, and that's because it partly is. But I sincerely feel that the direction of politics in Singapore is heading towards dangerous territory. When government officials (allegedly) remove newspaper editors because they don't like what was published; when there are (arguably) politically-charged lawsuits against opposition leaders; when one party has the power to amend the constitution as they wish without real opposition... this is not healthy for the development and progress of a country, both politically and socially.

I just feel that a healthy democracy requires citizens who are vocal and passionate about what they believe in. I don't mean protests and riots on the streets, or the ugly polarization in the US. But a peaceful walkout/in is a great start, and I'm just disappointed that there are so many people who are immediately cynical/dismissive of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9tshrg/serious_rant_why_are_we_not_more_supportive_of/,0.0,"[' - It was not some local initiative, but a global Google thing.\n - Their ""walkout"" was purely indoors.\n\nI think if even one Google Singapore employee had the balls to do the walkout outside with placards and all, we\'d give that person a lot of respect.\n\nThis felt more like they just had to attend another annoying obligatory meeting.']"

430,singapore,145814,Aunties and their sense of entitlement,a4v4ju,PM_ME_FRESH_PUPPERS,1544443856,113,1,"7.20 pm. My bus stops to pick up passengers before moving off to my stop. I sit at the back of the bus, waiting for passengers to come up to the second deck and sit down before I alight, as the space on the second deck was squeezy and I didn't want to have to squeeze past anybody to go down the stairs.

The bus passes the traffic light, and approaches my house's bus stop. I stand up, preparing to alight. A mother and her son climb up to the second deck. As kids are, her son happily skips along. I walk towards the stairs, keeping to the right. The bus jerks, and I take a bigger step forward, and I feel a bump on my left leg.

""Excuse me!"" I hear an indignant woman screaming, grabbing my arm. ""You knocked into my son!"" I ignore her, rushing to get off the bus, as I live in an ulu area and often has the bus skipped my stop despite having pressed the bell for the bus to stop.

""You knocked into my son!"" the woman screams again. I'm standing the top of the stairs, preparing to walk down, and I was facing the woman and her son. The son was unaffected, already seated on a seat. The mother glares at me, holding onto a pole. ""Your son was running,"" I reply. ""You're so big, he's just a kid. How can you knock into him?"" she continues. ""Everyone just saw you knock into my son!""

""So your son can run on the deck?"" I retort as I proceed to alight, only to hear her scream ""He wasn't running!""

What is up with all these aunties and their sense of entitlement? Her kid was obviously old enough to walk and talk, and obviously smart enough to keep to the sides when walking. Anybody who has ever been on the upper deck of a double-decker bus knows how cramped the space is. So why was I screamed at by a lady for something that happens so commonly?

It's pretty much something unavoidable on public transport, especially if you're rushing. Everyone has been pushed, shoved, bumped into on public transport on a near-daily basis. Yes, he is a kid, he shouldn't be subjected to the horrifying experience of a tall, 175m underweight man walking quickly into him. But if YOU as a parent want to have children, it is YOUR responsibility to keep him safe from the harsh, cruel battlefield that is public transport.

At the same time, the kid was unharmed seeing how he just walked up to a seat and sat down instead of crying, screaming, or making a fuss. So why was the mother making a fuss out of nothing? If it was a man I knocked into, and he turned and shouted, ""Oi, you knock into me leh!"", it would probably devolve to a fight and end with both of us in handcuffs. Why are aunties/mothers of young kids given a free pass to scream, or maybe complain to manager when ""Your food not nice my baby don't want eat! I WANT REFUND!""

If you're friends of new mothers (3~4-year old kids) or maybe single aunties who suspiciously have lots of cats, please, I implore you to educate them on societal rules instead of having the mentality that the world should bend to their whims.

Personally I feel that our government's actions are pretty weak - verbal action like ""We strongly protest Malaysia's actions""... ""willing to sit down and negotiate"". I'm not sure how all of you see this but it sounds like we are getting bullied very hard and we aren't standing up super hard despite it being an issue of sovereignty. Like the other time Malaysia suka suka wanna cancel the HSR or postpone we ended up sucking it up and we didn't push them to answer.

For the latest dispute - I saw someone mention that we have coast guards and that they should have been operated to intercept intruders into our sovereign territory. I'm sure we could have opted for some tougher choices like what was suggested.

For sure many people don't want to fight a war and are pessimistic about it to the point where we do not even dare to use military force as a verbal threat to defend our sovereignty but in my opinion it is still very necessary to do so - to assert that we will defend ourselves. I believe LKY had threatened to ""send the boys out"" if Johor had cut our water supply in the past which was essential to our national security.

How do you guys feel about this? Do you think that we aren't being harsh enough or do you think there are other ways to handle such disputes?

433,singapore,145472,Malaysian speaking here about this whole waters issue. ( please comment and reiterate ),a43vu1,seeingsounds731,1544215404,13,1,"Hi hi. I’ve seen so many different comments about this whole Malaysia - Singapore airspace / port limits thing here. Just FYI, r/malaysia is damn chilled about this. 

First things first, I get that you guys ( my dear sg friends ) are outrageous at the fact that how can Malaysia government anyhow park their ships and intrude your waters !?  I haven’t done any deep research yet, but based on what I’ve seen on this subreddit, it seems that Malaysia is at the wrong here.  And yes I agree that a country’s border is a very sensitive issue and Malaysian shouldn’t go around top-toeing around it. And to this, I believe Malaysia is at wrong. 

HOWEVER. 

Malaysia. Is. Not. Using. Singapore. As. A. Bogeyman. 

And to a certain extent...

Singapore. Is. Using. Malaysia. As. A. Bogeymen

I’ll explain. 

Ok first of all. How did this issue come out? 

Our transport minister Anthony Loke ( cool guy btw)  has issued a statement ( I think last week ) that they do not agree with the new policy that Singapore is about to roll out. To understand this, seletar airport in Singapore has been using the southern Johor airspace,under the consent of Malaysia government  with an agreement signed in 1974. 

It was all fine... as seletar airport was using the southern Johor airspace for private jets and training new pilots purposes. But now they are rolling a new expansion plan that involves seletar airport implementing a IILS - instrument landing system. Which basically is a system that guides plan to land safety instead of relying on the pilot. 

Apparently according to sources, Singapore approached Malaysia last year about this policy. But there were no feedback given by our previous regime government. 

Up to this point, are you with me? 

Moving on, as we experienced our first democratic change of our government, our aviation department spoke to Singapore aviation department and mentioned that there a few problems they have to address before they were ok with the whole ILLS system. 

So I believe it was last week, our transport minister, spoke at our parliament meeting, and they have decided that they do not agree with the ILLS system that Singapore is about to implement, as it affects our Pasir Gudang future developments. Apparently with the new system, planes might fly lower and it causes height restrictions, and port activities in the area. 

So now Malaysia wants to talk to Singapore about this issue. 

Transport minister of Singapore has denied that it would affect Pasir Gudang activities ... but come on.. that’s our area and our airspace, it’s not really up to u to judge whether it might be affected right? Even it’s not affected now, it definitely affects Pasir Gudang future development potential.

So up to here, u may think .... walao why never say earlier when our Singapore government asked for comment last year?? Now only say?! Roti prata again is it ??? 

Ok to this point - 
1. Our previous regime was fucked up. They probably don wan to offend Singapore because I believe they need Singapore to help them cover up some 1MDB shit.

2.  Or, they were fucking lazy and fucked up, that’s why we fucking changed our gov. 

3. If you think the issue is because we never say earlier, do u actually secretly agree that what the Malaysia is saying is reasonable, just that our previous regime was too coward to fight? 


Ok. So i don know what our transport department wants now, maybe they just want the ILLS to fuck off, or they want to take back the airspace I’m not sure. But right now this is also a intrusion of airspace because Singapore is planning to use the airspace in a way Malaysia does not allow. 




SO. After this issue popped out. 


Singapore replies with - eh Malaysia keep intruding our waters leh. 14 times d. 


Okkkk..... 


WHY SAY NOW DUDE? 

I know. I know. We are at wrong. We are. 

What I’m saying is, this sounds like something u are using to fight us back. Previously this issue has not been raised before no? Why no?


So. Instead of suggesting that Malaysia is using Singapore as a bogeyman... I would say it’s another way around.  ( election coming soon... leadership changing soon on ? )

442,singapore,0,What are some interesting things about your family history?,5m5tue,shian243,1483614613,46,43,"I come from a pretty much military history, my grandparents and great grandparents fought in the second world war.
 
Grandpa on my mum's side was doing cladestine ops on drug dealers and the underworld before ww2 in modern day Thailand, and then he went on to fight against the Japanese under the KMT flag. Before, he went through monkhood (he was thai so they all had to go through it)

 Then he got himself imprisoned and managed to escape from the POW Camp.

After the war, he continued the fight as a colonel in KMT, alongside Chiang Kai Shiek until they lost, and he escaped to what is now Taiwan.

My grandma which he married, underwent torture by the Japanese occupiers in China. Her dad was a high ranking official, and they were trying to get his whereabouts. She refused, and they did water torture and rubbed chili into her open wounds. Luckily, he was safe and came back after the war. After my grandpa died, she had a shiton of money from his pension and travelled the world, except Japan, which she hates.

My grandpa on my dad side was kinda boring, they owned a farm in Hainan Island, and then my grandpa came to SG and some of his relatives died from the Japanese massacre here. 

My uncle is a chef, worked in the Istana for some time for SR Nathan, and then he runs a school tuckshop (he owns a drinks stall so he's swimming in money I'm sure) used to be head chef of Peninsula Hotel, he did ice carving and fruit carving when it was appreciated back then.

My Dad worked as a photographer for SAF, and then went on to work for SPH for more than 40 plus years, taking photos from all sorts of events, including when the Indonesians planted bombs in Singapore with Saboteurs. He's pretty much covered the history of SG.

My mum? She worked at a toy factory which you probably played as a kid.

And on my mum's side, her great grandpa was an official in qing dynasty before it collapsed.

A shame that we didn't collect artifacts in the family, would had been cool to see my grandpa's military gear.

Ever since I was young, I was very particular about how others see/judge me. The way I looked, behaved and talked were always the first thing that came into mind when I’m interacting with someone. This contributes to the reason why I am “socially inept” because the anxiety is overcoming my train of thought and words that came out of my mouth are not what I desire. Along with the low self-esteem and confidence, I find it difficult to make friends because I’m what everyone calls a “quiet kid”. 

Fast-forward in life, I didn’t make any efforts to seek help. My condition deteriorated so badly that I refuse to speak to anyone. I tried to avoid conversation entirely due to the fear of being judged or embarrassed. 

My wakeup call was when I realized that I can’t live my life being mute any longer! Since it’s a new year, I want to be a better person. I’ve tried visiting my school’s counselor (took a lot of courage) but I found it ineffective. 

I have not told anybody about my condition as I’m too embarrassed to share it with them and I’ve yet to declare my mental state in the pre-enlistment for NS since I’ve never gotten a professional assessment of my mental health before. I know mental issues are a taboo subject in SG and I’m sorry if I offended anyone but are there better ways can I go about seeking help? Is it possible to fight this battle on my own?

Edit: Thanks for all your replies! I read every single one of them and would definitely heed to your advice. I've never felt this hopefully before so thanks a bunch for your understanding. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/5lwnjm/struggling_with_anxiety_need_help/,0.0,"[""You shouldn't be embarrassed or feel judged.

You only get one life, so live it the way you want and not how others think you should. Sounds easier said than done, but it's true.\n\nYou should always seek help and advice from a family member or trusted friend. You would be surprised how common it is for people to suffer some form of anxiety or depression.

Saw this post a few days ago, ""would you stay and fight if Singapore goes to war.""

We're seen this discussion many times online with people declaring their unshakable loyalty to this 649km²* piece of land. (* depends on high tide or low tide) Others would be frank and say would try to AWOL rather than risk their lives.

But IMO, this is a very oversimplified discussion which lacks real life variables.

Why would we be at war? Who would be at war with? Do we have allies? Is it a defensive war or an offensive war? Is it a siege? Does the opposing military allow for a peaceful surrender (knowing bulk of the Singapore army is made of conscripts who rather not fight)? Why would any country want to attack a financial hub?

These scenario would greatly affect your view on ""fighting for your country"". Eg: Hunkering down at the border shore is totally different from being sent to fight a proxy war somewhere else.

So with that, what do you think the most likely scenario that Singapore will get involved in a war?

Here's my exit interview.",60fqn0,jjhaha,1490005993,219,487,"It's been an interesting 5 years where I've learned a lot so I wanted to share my experience with everyone. I don't want this to be a critique but an assessment of my thoughts as I prepare to leave. I'm leaving because of family reasons. I want to be closer to my family and ready to start my own.

**EDIT: thank you for all the warm comments and excellent discussion. No matter what conclusions we come up with, in the end, Singapore will have given me more than I can ever repay with my 7% tax bracket and NETS. 

A bit of background:

* I've been in Asia for over 10 years so I'm not an Asian noob. I've bribed cops, ate dog meat, have slept in jungles, etc. 
* None of my companies that I've worked for have ever given me a ""package"". I pay my own rent, I buy my own lunch, etc. 
* Sometimes I'm more kiasu than locals. Carohell? yeah, most likely me (50% off? can? so how?.. fuck cold storage, I only buy sale items at shen siong.. I'm always the first one into a bus cause I know how to box out aunties..etc)

What I'll miss:

* Changi - more specifically, the automated immigration gates and the security check at each gate. This means I can show up 1 hour before my flight and still have time to spare to eat Texas Chicken at the Jetstar terminal. 
* sales at Uniqlo - I'll wait until the clothes I want is on sale and it always does. Now my wardrobe is about 80% uniqlo clothes. 
* Spize - Its good and the portion sizes are big, so that means I have a meal for the next day. 
* MBS - the casino. I think I'm up like $2K there and its funded a few vacations and paid for a few celebration macaroons from TWG. 
* M1 - I enjoyed getting 5gb data for $30/month and also 300MB fiber internet for $35/month, mostly without contracts. 
- * Old Airport Rd hawker - I think this place has the highest density variety+tasty. I was here at least once a month. 
- * Sheltered walkways - For having such a rainy climate, I can move around fairly easily without an umbrella. 
- * Challenger - I enjoy looking at gadgets and it was nice having one close to where I lived
- * Koi/GongCha/Fruces - I know I should cut out this habit but I'm always down for a cup of milk tea + aloe vera
- * Robertson Quay canal - Its one of the few places I run at almost every week

What I won't miss:

* Lack of fresh, variety veggies in local diet - yo! where's the veggies? its all meat + carbs. 
* Real housewives of singapore facebook group - I'm not a part of this group but I've seen examples of how crazy it gets. They will cat fight and stomp on each other to buy 2nd hand stuff. The best is the #nomaidsundays when their maids have the day off and some are proud that they've accomplished a cold storage trip by themselves. 
* choping - no need to comment on this practice
* the car traffic - for not having a large car density, i've never been in or seen so many traffic accidents. I generally fear for my life crossing the street. 
* gov't marketing - my youtube and bus rides are littered with dumb gov't marketing ads. I understand many need more etiquette training but the execution is awful. 
* Singlish - its a bit harsh on the ears. Not my favorite slang/accent. 
* lack of homegrown inspiration - I know this is a bigger discussion, but there is a lack of ""interestingness"" from local bands, films, art, etc. 
* trying hard to get closer to locals - I know most of you are introverts but damn, open up a little more
* kiasu/etiquette - again, this is a bigger discussion but this culture style is totally self inflicted and won't change until there's more enlightenment. i would say ""just chill out""

I think for most of us foreigners, we generally like it here but its hard to really love. I think its the last 3 points that discourages from really calling Singapore ""home"" and more like a transit point to somewhere else. Just a place to see and experience but can't be there for long because something is missing. 

Thanks Singapore, its been fun, we've had a lot of good memories.. but its time to bid adieu!

The week preceding raya,my sister and i had a big fight. a literal fight. kicks and punches were exchanged. It was a gradual build up til i could tolerate none of her bullshit. the last straw was when she picked my stuff from inside the room and threw it into the hall where i was at then. i lost it and that's when it started.

 I got kicked out explicitly by my dad. told me to throw the key inside after locking the gate. i went out with a big batam bag of clothes i deemed necessary and off i went into the unknown. there I was, an 18 year old kid with $64 and a bag worth of clothes to my name. this was last Thursday .

i don't really have much ride or die friends that would offer me shelter. I crashed at a friend's house for 4 days or so but the day before raya his dad subtly told me to scram. 'ah,youre still here?never go home,your parents never look for you ah?' i meekly smiled and packed my bags,lying through my teeth that I'll be home just in time for raya celebrations. 

Im not here to look for goodwill or sympathy. Just some help in pointing me to some daily rated/cheap bedspace/hotel/hostel/quarters/whatever where i can safely put my belongings on a night stand instead of cramming my wallet, phone and spectacles into my pockets everynight before sleeping . Somewhere i can rest my head on with a pillow and not tightly rolled shirts. 

If you're suggesting i get back to my family,sorry but i cant see it happening in the near future. This is the final trigger and I've decided to cut ties with them for the greater good. also some information that might help, im working 'full time' per se. I'm paid daily $75 if i turn up to work.i plan to tank this and stay at whatever place i can find til i scrape enough money for a rental room.

No. I share the view expressed by Lee Kuan Yew that if, because we become incompetent and corrupt, there is a change of government to another party, then we will live with it. We would not cry over the demise of the PAP if it happens that way. So there is democracy, we allow others to compete with us; but we set out to be the best. And given our efficiency, and the small size of Singapore, and the fact - which people do not understand - that every constituency is actually a microcosm of Singapore, then if we do well as a government, we are likely to win most of the seats. It's not like a big country where you have local factors. There are very few local factors at work in Singapore. So you either win overwhelmingly or you lose the government.

**Under your genial exterior, you are pretty tough and hard.**

I would say firm and disciplined. While there's always a logical mind at work, I show a more human side of government. But the PAP is not going to become soft and effete under my leadership. If the party were getting soft underneath, you can be sure I would not be here talking to you. I would be pushed out.

**Yet Singapore society has loosened up amazingly in the 1990s, are you prepared to let this laxity continue?** 

I am pondering over the word 'laxity.' It seems to suggest slackening. But certainly we've got to recognize what the aspirations of a younger population will be. We've got to move with the times. Of course, we've also got to bear in mind the needs of older Singaporeans. We have to balance these two segments of the population. So as Singapore changes, we move along with it. In politics, in the arts, we have to be in tune with the times.

**You said Singapore should be a fun place to live in -- not something Mr. Lee would ever have said.**

You would be surprised. He has a very stern exterior, but in fact he also knows that we've got to keep in tune with the place. Back in 1984, I put up the short manifesto for the party. We called it Vision 1999, saying that Singapore should be a fun place to live in. Of course, as PM and head of the party, he vetted the draft. He agreed very much that Singapore has got to be a fun place. Because it must be a home for Singaporeans, not just an economy. Singaporeans want fun and they've got to be able to have it here -- otherwise they will go outside for it.

**But you don't let journalists have much fun, you are always berating them -- most recently for critical articles they wrote about the police. Can't you ease up on them?**

No, there are certain things which they must learn they should not do. My home affairs minister spoke out because he perceived that the Straits Times seemed to have an agenda in going after the police. So he briefed the cabinet and said that if the respect for the police is eroded through misperception as portrayed by the Straits Times articles, it's going to make the police job much more difficult. So he had my permission to make the critical speech which he made. If there are problems with the police, then of course they have got to be heard. But there were no problems.

**Given that there are only two elected opposition MPs out of 81, isn't it important to have a robust press as a watchdog?**

I would not agree entirely with that. I mean, if things are wrong, the media can report it. I have no problem with that. But watchdog, meaning that they can investigate every matter, espousing views and setting their own agenda, I would not agree with that. My view is quite straightforward: if you want to set a political agenda for Singapore, then you have to be in the political arena. Otherwise you don't have the accountability and the responsibility of looking after the place. We have got to face the people. If we misgovern, they will chase after us. Our heads will be on the chopping block. The media's head is not on the chopping block.

**Journalists sometimes think it is.**

Well, when they go wrong, you've got to put them right.


**Doesn't this reflect an outdated 'PAP knows best' credo? Singapore now has a very sophisticated, intelligent population, they don't need a nanny any more.**

Ha, ha, that's what people think. But you must believe that the PAP knows best. If you don't believe in that, then we have no business being in government. Having said that, it doesn't mean we have a monopoly of views. We know best, but we listen to views from elsewhere. If the views are sensible, we co-opt them as our own -- or make them into our policies. So that's also part of knowing best. But in the end, I believe that we are the people who can make the best judgement of where Singapore should go.

**You don't listen to opposition views . You don't even give them much chance to speak. Once again, you recently refused Chee Soon Juan's request for a permit to speak?**

No, he can speak. A permit can be given to him to speak in certain places. But the police are against giving permits to speak in public places, because you lose control over traffic, over crowds and so on. He can apply to speak in a hotel or an indoor stadium. He can express what he wants. He can call a press conference and express views. That's not a problem.


**Senior Minister Lee says Chee will be annihilated in the next election.**

I thought that he had been annihilated already? He will stand again, of course. But he has tremendous character flaws. And I think they will be exposed again to the public. You know, we look at the opposition from two angles. One is the ideas of the opposition member. The other is the character of the opposing party. If the ideas would not do great harm to Singapore, if they challenge ours, then there's a place for the people who express them. But even though people may have fairly sound ideas, if their character is wrong -- in particular, if their integrity is suspect, then we would try and annihilate that person. Because, as I said just now, in another context, you must have the moral authority to govern Singapore.

**It seems you find nearly all opposition characters lacking in integrity.**

That's the unfortunate part of the opposition parties. They are the people we would not recruit into the PAP. So by definition, you have more good guys with us and more bad guys with them. The PAP is not an ideological party. It is a broad-based party. Many of the people who want to join us don't agree with us on everything. In our interviews of potential candidates, we ask them what are the policies you agree with and what are the policies you disagree with us. And why? Why? We want to know why. If they agree all the time, we are a little suspicious.

**But you do investigate opposition politicians pretty closely? Frankly, you are looking for something to get them.**

We study them, yes, of course. This is a serious business. If an opposition party makes headway and comprises men or women who we think are going to bring down Singapore, we have to try and keep them out of power. Because once they are in, they are going to build. And they are going to confuse the public through the wrong use of statistics, which makes government much more difficult. Ultimately what's going to be the position of Singapore, that's our concern.

**What about those who say you use the judiciary to silence critics?**

That's nonsense. What are these critics? There are many critics of the PAP in Singapore. They are not all hauled up before the judiciary. Political opponents, so long as they keep within the law, don't need safeguards. They do not have to appear before the judiciary. But if they've defamed us, we have to sue them -- because if we don't, our own integrity will be suspect. We have an understanding that if a minister is defamed and he does not sue, he must leave cabinet. By defamation, I mean if somebody says the minister is on the take or is less than honest. If he does not rebut it, if he does not dare go before the court to be interrogated by the counsel for the other side, there must be some truth in it. If there is no evidence, well, why are you not suing?

**You mentioned recently that consideration had once been given to voluntarily splitting the PAP. Was this a serious proposal, and if so, why?**

This thing was serious. It took place after we had lost a couple of seats in 1984, when we felt that the people wanted opposition. They wanted a PAP government, but they also wanted more opposition. So the dilemma was how to accommodate this without a freak election result. We wondered if it would it better to split the PAP to form a genuine opposition -- because if you split, and you're on the other side, you fight to get into government. That way people could see a contest of ideas, decent people with good ideas fighting to be in government. And whoever wins, it doesn't matter to us, because it's the best team in charge. So that's the kind of two-party system which we thought Singapore could have. But it was theoretical. And when we thought about splitting the cabinet down the middle, we all thought that Singapore would be the worse for it.

**You mentioned that BG Lee Hsien Loong and Tony Tan might lead the two sides if you had decided to do it.**

Because they happen to be deputy prime ministers, not because there's any rivalry between them. In other words, as PM I'd step aside, and then you split. Form your own little faction. But I agree, they are different characters. Tony Tan is quite conservative. He doesn't relish politicking like BG Lee, who, being a younger man, knows you've just got to go out to win people.

**Why did say you would not rule out a split in the PAP, although it would be unlikely in the next ten years?**

It was just a logical comment. How can I predict whether the PAP will split in the future? You can't predict. It could be on personality or ideology. I only mentioned ten years, because that's as far as I can see. I know Singaporeans, I know what they are like, I know their thinking, so within ten years I'm sure there'll be no split. But after ten years, I do not know who will be in the party.

**Will you lead the party into the next election?**

Yes.

**Will BG Lee Hsien Loong be the next prime minister?**

It seems to be a given that he will succeed sometime after 2002.

**You will step down after the next election?**

I would not disagree.

**And before the next election after that.**

Ideally, I should have the luxury of contemplating that.

**When you step down, you will remain in cabinet as a senior minister?**

Once you step down, you leave it to the next prime minister to decide. It's not for me to decide.

**How is your rapport with Lee Kuan Yew these days?**

Well, you know, we have, shall we say, a candid relationship. I don't know if that is the right term. An open relationship. He gives his views. I don't take offence. He told me, quite frankly, that I am his second choice as PM; but better that than to have a misunderstanding.

**He need not have said it in public.**

Well, he's got his agenda. And I think it's better that we're on the level, that he's said all these things publicly. It's better that I'm not seen to be his choice. If I were seen to be his choice alone, and I did not have the support of my colleagues, it would be much more difficult for me to do my job. But if I'm not his choice, and I was chosen by my colleagues, they will support me and they'll see that I succeed in my job.

**He spoke recently of PAP veterans being like rare gems. You are having trouble finding new gems these days?**

Yes, that's a major problem. We have technical pieces of diamond, but to get a real gem, a diamond of exceptional quality and size, that's rare.

**Will the third generation of PAP leaders be up to scratch?**

Well, there's a core group -- Lee Hsien Loong, George Yeo, Teo Chee Hean, Lim Hng Kiang. They are the kind of quality you want. They are up to scratch. Potential gems, some of them still being polished. But we haven't got the numbers yet. We must have a team, not just a core group.

**Do you still enjoy being prime minister?**

You must enjoy the job. I was a reluctant prime minister. But I think I am coping.

Singaporeans and relative to divorce court in Singapore.

Context/summary of the situation is both parents have been unhappy for a while. They don't share financial earnings or spendings, and mother is currently in a bad place financially (think liabilities like insurance plans and unemployment) Father had one cheating incident a long time ago, and because of that they went to family court and reached a settlement internally, and mother has been emotionally and sexually distant with him till today. Recently found out father has an affair while working overseas, and very likely a pregnancy is involved. Mother's behaviour is erratic at best, which is understandable but sometimes uncalled for: shouting, stalking, blaming (even early mornings and late at night) and doing everything she can to show that she hates him and wanting him to pay for what he did.

Basically want to know what I can help him with without seeking expensive lawyer consultations because both him and his parent are inexperienced, and they seemed to be entering an expensive legal battle really soon. Any sound and helpful advice will be nice and really appreciated. He has been losing sleep and suffering mentally these past few weeks while trying to maintain a day job that's taking a toll on him physically.

Am able to provide more context when necessary. 

More context: at the end of the day, mother wants the house, but she has been quite provocative and acting all entitled. Father do not want to give up the house at all. More importantly, he doesn't even feel that he committed adultery, and just wants the mother to accept it. He wants to support the pregnancy and claims that he is in love with her. Quite fucked up.

Problem is the house has been paid for under CPF, with the dad being the bigger contributor by a significant percentage. His job is relatively stable, paying well and he goes on business trips a lot. In a long legal battle, I'm afraid that he could fight for a while. More importantly is we are wishing that my friend don't come out at the bad end of the stick and end up suffering a lot of collateral damage.

461,singapore,0,From Crippling Shyness to Outgoing Chatterbox: A Cat's Take,6ekkep,HidingCat,1496292772,34,94,"#Preamble

So, I've been seeing quite a few redditors here saying that they're introverted or shy and feel they're doomed to a life of loneliness, and at the same time there've also been a few people curious about me, so I've been thinking about doing this post for some time, and here it is!

#Shy? ""Introverted""?

For those of you who think that it's hard to talk to people for whatever reason, please understand that it's not PERMANENT — behaviours can be changed and you don't always have to be this way. In fact I really hate the introvert/extrovert angle: Introversion/extroversion as most people understand it is not really anchored in any serious psychology study that I've read, and it's really a more complex thing than a simple continuum, never mind a hard a/b classification. Not to mention that introverts aren't necessarily social recluses either. 

As for me... let's start from the beginning.

#An incredibly shy kid who got better

Most babies at around the age of one year are able to say simple words like ""mama"" or ""dada""; I didn't. It took me until the age of three before I said a word, and that word was ""car"". My parents were so worried before that moment that they visited doctors multiple times to see if there was something wrong with me.

That reluctance to speak carried on till I was in primary school. I had no friends, spoke to no classmates at all, and only very reluctantly spoke to teachers when called upon. During recess I either sat in the classroom reading (I was one hell of a reader as a kid) until class resumed, or I'd sit on the benches in the canteen watching others play. I didn't buy anything to eat because that'd mean talking to the stall operators, and who has the guts for that?

Things got a bit better as I got into upper primary and made a few friends, but even then I only made a few friends for the bare minimum of a social support network and that was about it.

#The game-changers

The first big change happened during... well, you guessed it: National Service. Unlike many others, circumstances meant that I ended up in a unit that was largely geared towards reservist administration and training. For me, I had to learn to interact with a fair number of people every few weeks, and made sure that I communicated and instructed the reservists clearly. Another big influence was being around people who weren't in or affected by the narrow tunnel view that someone who was stuck in 12 years of the Singapore education system; basically, these people had the street smarts I didn't have, and I learnt very quickly from them. Looking back I think that was a big change, as it primed myself to adapt to the other changes that lay ahead. 

After NS came university; as some of you may know, I entered SMU, where every module had a group presentation, and your participation in class was also graded. The time during then helped me to focus on having a louder voice (I still don't like using it very much though), as well as granted the posture and body language needed for a successful presentation.

A few other things happened more recently that greatly added to the foundations: I helped someone I knew in a retail place that was known for its customer service, and I also did some volunteer work in my spare time. Both these experiences taught me what being sincere and positive can do to help people, and that small gestures can go a long way in touching people's lives. Speaking of being positive...

#Positivity

A few have remarked how positive I am. As mentioned, working in a positive retail environment really helped me shape my perception, as well as doing volunteering work, but what's also important is that ultimately, I've always been an idealist at heart. I've always believed in doing the ""right thing"", whatever that is. It may have come from reading too much; too much of what, I can't remember! Maybe it's all the children's books about young heroes and heroines?

It's not like I've always been this way though; I've been cynical and downcast at times (especially during that teen and young adult phase), but with age I've come to realise that I'd really rather look on the bright side than thinking the worst of everything and everyone. Life is simply too short to remain unhappy for long.

Another factor is that I've been in a pretty well-off environment; I've had loving parents despite our fair share of disputes and fights, and we've never had to worry about where the next meal is coming from. While I wouldn't say I'm rich (still can't afford a HDB flat on my own, loan or no), not being stuck in a fight for basic survival probably helps.

#So, to end...

Well, sorry to say if this didn't contain any miracle advice; if you were expecting shortcuts, there really are none to be found, and that's what life is most of the time. It is a lot of experience and hard work. The theme as you may have realised is that it took me a while to go from A to B; what I hope you take away from this is that nothing is truly permanent as long as you want to change, and that change has to be fought for — most of the rapid changes I've gone through came from being tossed in the deep end and me butting with the edges of my comfort zone. If you're thinking that you want to change, don't take as long as I did. Start today!

Extinction, solitude, stress, or materialism, are the narratives that are often used in the concept for each work.

Video Installation / Interactive

[GUILTY LANDSCAPES III](https://www.sifa.sg/sifa/programme/shows/guilty-landscapes-iii/) - A part of the [SINGAPORE INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF ARTS 2017](https://www.sifa.sg/sifa/programme/shows/)

In an interactive video installation, the protagonist on the evening news looks directly at the viewer, providing a framework for each viewer to scrutinise his or her own feelings of discomfort. Dutch theatre-maker and visual artist Dries Verhoeven asks us: What if the people we watch on the news can look back at us? What if the gaze is reversed?

Guilty Landscapes III transports images of uncomfortable responsibility into the white cube of a gallery. In the otherwise empty space, a disconcerting landscape is projected on a large wall. As soon as a viewer steps into the room, he or she becomes an integral part of the installation. Every viewer experiences a truly individualised connection to the situation on screen. Suddenly, feelings of distance and proximity seem to merge.

[NIGHT VISIONS - A solo exhibition by South Korean artist JIEUN PARK](http://www.redseagallery.com/exhibitions/night-visions)

Park's distinctive style blends large brushstrokes and splatters of ink with detailed depictions of urban landscapes at night. While capturing the excitement and magic of various cities – among these, for example, are Hong Kong, Singapore, London and New York – the works also reveal a more subdued, contemplative narrative. Through her paintings, Park hints at a paradox of urban life – being surrounded by thousands of people, yet feeling utterly alone.

She presents her new experimentations in Chinese ink within contemporary contexts, using single point and multipoint perspectives to create pictorial and abstract compositions. Moving beyond flat surfaces, Hong investigates the possibility of the 3D in ink painting, boldly reconstructing surface textures to expand our views of Chinese ink traditions through paper reliefs, challenging the definition of space that is unlimited by medium and dimension.

469,singapore,0,On dealing with examination stress,6v1a12,chintokkong,1503298692,23,90,"Saw a few posts on this sub about anxiety, stress and examinations, thought I share something here to spark some discussion on how studying and stress can be made more effective. Not sure how relevant my points would be, but hopefully they would be helpful to some students.

.

---

Firstly, appreciate how stress can work for you.

1. When our mind perceives threat/opportunity in the horizon, physical and mental resources are mobilized to help us deal with the threat/opportunity. This mobilization strains us and it is this strain that’s called ‘stress’. 

2. Treating stress as totally bad and stressing over stress is not helpful - it tends to create negative feedback loops. So instead of mobilizing more physical and mental resources to fight against the mobilization itself (thus escalating the stress level unproductively), use the heightened resources to help you in your studies instead. 

3. Just as exercise (a form of physical strain) can strengthen the body when coupled with enough nutrition and rest, mental stress can also 'strengthen' the mind when coupled with enough nutrition and rest. Stress can be good for us, so eat healthily and rest adequately to strengthen that mind of yours during periods of stress.


Secondly, associate stress more with daily targets than with long-term goals.

1. Future-oriented goals like aiming to get a certain number of As and Bs for the examination aren’t always useful. I mean, what can you actually do directly about your grades when the examination is still months away and you are not the marker of your own scripts? The truth is there’s nothing you can do directly about your grades. 

2. It is more helpful to associate your stress with daily targets instead. Direct your physical and mental resources on what you can study today rather than waste energy worrying endlessly about what grades you might get for your examination. Worrying doesn’t really get things done. Doing gets things done.

3. When stress is clearly associated with daily target, the accomplishment of it at the end of the day brings about a release of that stress, which then makes you feel happy and good about yourself. And when work is done for the day, you can relax and enjoy the rest of the hours in greater peace. This eventually creates a positive feedback loop which will motivate you to study again the next day.


Thirdly, for those who are rather behind in their studies and prone to procrastination, Keep It Simple &amp; Straightforward (KISS).

1. It’s stressful trying to catch up in your studies when you are quite far behind. I guess the tendency is to try to deny the fact or to escape the stress by indulging in distractions, hence the procrastination. Forget about studying smart for now. Simply study hard. 

2. Don’t bother coming up with some ideal fanciful daily studying plan (which you probably won’t follow anyway). Simply target to study a certain number of hours on your own every day, like for a start - 2hrs every afternoon. Strategizing on what to study may make you appear smart, but this strategizing is not actual studying. Actual studying is actual studying! Work on your TYS, redo your old test/exam papers by covering the answer with a blank piece of paper, make your own study notes and memorize them.

3. If you are prone to procrastinate, don’t go home immediately after school to bathe, to lie comfortably on the bed, to fiddle with your phone/tablet/laptop. Don’t go to the soccer field or basketball court to have a ‘quick’ game. You know clearly where that leads. Stop making excuses and stop lying to yourself just so you can take the easy way out. Intensive studying is tough. You are better off using the mental energy to understand, memorise and practice than on deceiving and tempting yourself.

4. Grab a quick meal after school if you’re hungry, then head straight to a conducive location in your school to study. Don’t even bother asking yourself whether you want to go there to study or not. It’s a stupid question. If you have wanted to study in the first place, you won’t even ask yourself the question! 

5. Shut the phone, take out the battery, make it difficult to use. Or if you have a trusted studying companion, ask him/her to change the lock code of your phone for the duration of your self-study. The problem with phone messaging is that, when you message your friends, your mind keeps anticipating a reply. The mind cannot settle down to focus on studying. Mental resources are thus wasted on resisting the temptation to check for relies. If you need help asking questions and clarifying doubts, collate them all and find a teacher or a helpful schoolmate to explain to you face-to-face.

Finally, the nature of conventional reality is that not all 100% of the students can become top 50% of the cohort. Someone will definitely be below average in terms of examination results. But if you are able to cope with the examination stress and put in the necessary hard work to study, no matter what the results, you would have learned something useful about yourself. 

Ultimately, it’s not good grades that make your life fulfilling. It’s when you have understood your own mind well enough to manage and deal with all life circumstances, then living can be fulfilling. So make good use of this stretch of intensive studying to appreciate how your mind works and to learn how you can utilise stress effectively. While studying for the examination, study yourself too. Because it’s self-knowledge (and not worldly-knowledge) that lasts you a lifetime.

Best wishes to those preparing for their coming exams!

And how effective will we be with mobilizing our NSmen into real combat? What about chain of command? How will commanders make sure they keep the morale within NS units?

The only combat we really seen was the konfrontasi period with Indonesia, and even then, it was small skirmish rather than a full blown war.

And given that a large amount of equipment is overseas, how do we get them back in time?

483,singapore,0,Is there any laws regarding false road accident claims?,7ax06g,CaiusG,1509880066,12,2,"Happened earlier today.

Was at a carpark waiting for a slot for at least 15 minutes, finally a car left, but before my father could park the car, someone cut him and took the lot instead. My father drove closer, winded down the window and shouted at him to get out of the lot. The guy retaliated saying that he was there first ( lol by there he meant 50m away, the moment the initial car left he sped in front of us and took the lot, almost hitting our car in his rush to snatch the lot ). We said that we waited 15min for a lot, he said he waited 20 hence he should get it. Just then, another car in front left, so my mum told my father to let it go. 

After we’re done parking, he approached us, saying that we hit his car when he was parking, and demanded for my father’s IC. My father refused to give it to him and explained to him in a much nicer way than I would have about how it was impossible that we hit his car. The angle was wrong, our car was scratchless ( the colour of our car makes scratches extremely visible ), there was no shards or paint chips on the floor, and the area where he claimed our car hit his was rusty. Unless the steel rusted under the paint coat, there was no way the dent was caused by us. Also, if you drive and ever got into an accident, you’d know that no matter how small, a hit will definitely be felt. There is no way a damage like his ( it was quite a big hole ) was not felt at all. He told my father to handover his IC or he will call the police, and my father called the police for him. While my father was on the phone with the police, he tried to take a video of my mother and I. I shouted at him and he deleted it. My mother tried to reason with him, and he made a sexist remark about how women should not interrupt in men matters. 

The police came and took statements, my father is going to make an official police report at his request. 

Just a question, is there any law against people who falsify claims and police reports? I looked through my father’s dashcam and we can easily prove our innocence, nowhere in the whole two minutes were the front of our car even near the spot where he claimed we hit. He does not even have a dashcam to begin with. 

I feel that such people should not be let go so easily. He was probably just hoping we’d be an easy target for us to help him pay for a new paintwork. Thankfully, because of our in-car dashcam, we can fight his claims. However, this may happen to somebody who does not have a in-car dashcam, or just pay him/accept his claim to avoid trouble.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/7ax06g/is_there_any_laws_regarding_false_road_accident/,0.0,['Does you dad have any in car video?

484,singapore,0,From GLBT Voices Singapore,79803n,STforum,1509161349,7,0,"The first time after we had done it, I remember K cupping my face and looking into my eyes. He told me seriously that he would like to see more of me, but we could never have a long term relationship. Just like that. No fuss, no qualms. I kissed him back and told him he was being silly, like I was going to fall for him.

He was studying to be a doctor at that time while I was just finishing my NS. Physically he was everything a gay guy could want but he always walled himself up emotionally. Taking him at this word, I continued to have my own discreet affairs. We weren’t dating right? But we did all the things a couple could in Singapore – dinner, movies, night cycling through East Coast Park and lying on the beach as we talked and laughed while looking up at the night sky. The couple of times we went to the clubs, I thought I’d be the jealous one but instead he got uncomfortable when guys came to talk to me and that was the end of me going clubbing, as far as he was concerned. He still refused any forms of endearment that might mean we were seeing each other or ‘dating’. Once I texted him ‘I miss you’ and his reply was ‘I’m not into that’.

Still, we became so comfortable with each other that my parents got used to having him around. I wasn’t out to them but maybe they suspected. We hung out with a small circle of friends and everyone just referred to us as a couple, even though he never acknowledged it. He became a part of my life without my notice and I began to fall for him.

We started taking short trips together over the weekends. When we were in Bali, I met a hot American Chinese and was chatting him up when K stormed up and pulled me away. I was irritated and told him off, reminding him cruelly that he didn’t want a relationship and I could damn well talk to any guy I wanted, right? He didn’t reply me, just gave me this look of silent hurt and went back to our room.

Angry at him for not telling me why he wouldn’t admit he loved me, I went off with the ABC and spent the night with him. I returned in the morning feeling stupid and extremely guilty but he didn’t say a word of reproach, which made me feel worse. I finally couldn’t take it and just told him, if he couldn’t pick up the guts to admit he loved me and be with me, then we should stop seeing each other. He sat wordlessly on the bed and just nodded.

When we got back to Singapore, I packed the clothes he left at my place and threw it out of the door. I was so mad and hurt that he wouldn’t find me good enough to be his boyfriend, yet want me to stay exclusively with him only. I started sleeping around with guys I meet everywhere – the gym, the SAFRA pool, clubs, online. But no matter how often the random sex, I just couldn’t get him out of my head.

Then 3 years later, he turned up at my door. I was rushing an assignment for school and was about to leave when he knocked. I was hesitant about talking to him or even inviting him in but he said he would just tell me what he had to say and leave. No one was at home so I gave him a drink and told him to wait in the living room while I ran to my bedroom and texted my friend ‘omg what do I do HE is here!’. My friend’s reply was of no help, ‘Fuck him and make sure u use protection.’ Gee thanks.

So I sat down with him and asked him what’s happening. I was expecting all sorts of bullshit but I was not prepared for what he was about to tell me. He was getting married, to a girl he had met when he went scuba diving in Hin Daeng, the place he had promised to bring me once I was certified. It was a promise he made to his parents and as an only child, he was going to keep it. He handed me a card that he was holding, turned out to be the wedding invitation and he asked me if I could be there.

He said that this was a duty he had to do, but wanted me to know that the time we had spent together was the happiest he ever had. He was saying all those things about how I had made him feel but never told me till now, when it was too late. I sat there numbly not knowing what to think. I was losing the guy I love to… a girl he was marrying??

I lost it. I started by telling him that he was nuts, crazy for thinking he could keep up a sham marriage. I told him that he was a selfish bastard, for making me fall in love with him and not telling me once, just once he felt the same way for me until that day, the day he told me he was getting married?! I told him he was a fool for lying to his parents, I called him all sorts of names and I finally broke down and cried, not understanding why I couldn’t be good enough for him, or even just be a girl. I raged at him while my heart was breaking, splintering, shattering.

He spent the night with me. We made love with an intensity spurred by the knowledge that it would be our last night. In between, I laid curled up crying next to him while he held me like he never had. So many instances when I would pull back from kissing him, looking at him deep into his eyes, begging him silently to change his mind, that what we had at that moment meant more than anything to him. He never did.

In the morning, I couldn't bear to watch him leave. I told him to go and not to call me. I stayed huddled in the bed, the sheets smelling of what we did during the night and refused to see him out. When I heard the door shut, I knew I should just run after him, grab his hand and… and what? What could I do at that point that hadn’t been done already to tell him how much I love him?

I finally came out of the room when my mother came home that evening and called my name. She was holding onto an unmarked letter and inside was a card from him. It only had one line and it said, “Dear B, I love you. It will always be you.” I looked up at my mum and asked how she had gotten it, she said that K was waiting downstairs when she and my dad had gotten home and told her to pass it to me. I was dumbfounded, he was downstairs the entire day?!

She also said that he confessed to loving me and that he was gay, but he couldn’t be with me and apologized for breaking my heart. She asked me if this was true, that I was gay and I broke down and cried. She then hugged me and said it was okay, she was sorry I couldn’t work things out with the guy I love but she hoped I would find another guy who was just as sweet, maybe not so handsome because it made my sister jealous.

After that day, I tried hard to forget him. It was easy at first because I had to come out to my family proper and my sister was pissed that I didn’t tell her first. I didn’t know why I took so long to do it because they were okay with it. I asked my parents one day over lunch why weren’t they upset, I mean some of my friends were almost disowned the day they came out. My father looked at me and said why would he be upset that his son has the courage to face the difficulties that came with being gay, while my mum said jokingly that she was just pleased that she wasn’t getting a daughter-in-law to fight with over her son.

On the day of his wedding, I turned off my phone and spent the day with my friends, who tried their best to cheer me up. But throughout the day, I couldn’t stop thinking about how on the other side of the island he was promising to love and cherish another person and it hurt so so bad.

Life had to go on and it did for 7 years until she turned up. Last year, I had gotten a text asking if we could meet with no explanation whatsoever. We met up at a quiet bar after work and she introduced herself as C, K’s wife. I was surprised and slightly alarmed. I told her I hadn’t heard from K in years and we had nothing going on. She said it wasn’t about that and handed me a brown envelope.

Inside was an old army tee shirt of mine, one that had my unit’s insignia. There was also a picture we had taken on one of our many short trips and many movie ticket stubs, all the ink totally faded. I asked her why she was giving me these and she said that she was sorry, but K had passed away. He woke up in the middle of the night complaining of chest pains and by the time the ambulance had arrived, he had fainted. The paramedics tried to resuscitate him but he never came around. All this took place 2 months ago.

She was clearing his things when she discovered the envelope in his desk drawer, along with an old handphone she passed to me. Inside the phone was every text message I had sent him and she knew that I meant something to him. She asked if we were lovers and I didn’t know what to say. She told me that she wasn’t angry, that she always knew that her husband kept a part of him from her but he was loyal and provided for her. They had no kids though. She wanted me to have the things he had kept and said that we both obviously loved him a lot and she was glad that someone else loved him as much as she did.

We still keep in touch, as a strange sort of friendship developed between us. She never had a gay friend before and with her, I slowly learnt of his life after we had said goodbye. She recently started seeing a nice guy and I assured her he couldn’t possibly be gay, his taste in clothes was just too atrocious. She has always told me to find a nice boyfriend myself and I need to let go of the things I wanted to but didn’t say to him.

So if K was here, I would say to him, I love you. I never stopped loving you and I never will. You made me happy more than you ever knew, even when I didn’t understand why you couldn’t love me back. You gave me peace whenever you were around and thanks to you, the first time my parents knew I was gay was when a guy told them how much he loved me. Thank you for doing that.

1,NationalServiceSG,3870,NS is a waste of time (my views),i0l1ce,Trash_Panther,1596111488,28,1,"Ns is a total waste of time and brings about more cons than pros for us sons of Singapore. Im speaking from experience.

I am currently serving national service about 8 months in and my vocation is transport operator.
As a transport operator, one would think how 'lucky' we are as we are able to get free license, but in my opinion that is merely a tiny benefit which is massively overshadowed by the cons of this vocation.

Why do i think ns is a total waste of time?

Because aside from actual driving, the rest of the time we either sit in the car or in the bunk and do nothing. On days where we do not have drivings to do, we sit in the bunk the whole day, using our phones and wasting our lives and youth while our female peers pursue uni and find jobs, enriching their lives. Speaking from experience, i find it absolutely tiring to not do anything at all the whole day and theres only so much entertainment social media and netflix can give you before u get bored. And then theres the problem of not having enough data. If ns were to be shortened to say 1 year, it wouldnt be this bad as we could take this as a long holiday but 2 years is way too long and it has stretched from a holiday to a borefest and life-waster. I could accomplish so much in these 2 years be it education wise or job wise, but i have to 'serve the nation' by doing nothing and sitting on my bed in bunk. Is this your idea of 'serving the nation'?

My next point would be how ns takes away my social life. In driving vocation we are constantly bombarded with weekend duties and details without any pity from our superiors. My female friends who are attending uni have already minimum amount of time to go out with us and now with these weekend duties and details the chances of being able to ask them out for a gathering is greatly reduced. As they make new friends in uni and go out less with us, we will soon lose contact with them and ultimately become strangers. Is this what you want, to have your friends taken away from you just because u have to 'serve the nation'? And then theres the problem of spending time with family. For stay in units like mine, and with weekend duties, we sometimes spend up to 2 or 3 weeks not being able to see our family and spend quality time with them. My parents are getting old and time is very much cherished for them and because of ns, i have very little time to spend with them. The superiors constantly tell us how we have to spend quality time with our family but isnt it ironic with the amount of weekend duties you give us, we are not able to do so?

And my third point would be the people i meet in ns. I am an easygoing person who can get along really well with anybody but the people i meet here in my unit, they make it hard for me to do so. These people are what you would call 'YPs'. They fight and smoke in bunks not caring about the rest of us and how their actions will disturb us. I cant even complain about them to the superiors because if they were to find out im a snitch, im a goner. So in camp, everyday, i live under a constant stress for my living conditions, making me depressed and moody for most of the days. Is this really what you want your mental state to be?

Now i feel that everyone has their own experience on national service but i believe i am speaking for most of us here who have to serve. I suggest ns to be shortened to at most 1.5 years or at least make sure during weekends and public holidays all ns activities are cancelled so we can go home to spend quality time with our families. I know what im saying is pointless and the system will not change anytime soon but i just want to get some things off my chest and let it all out. 

I would be happy if anyone of you can share your thoughts and views on this issue. I am open to criticism. I just want to speak my mind. I do not mean any harm.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/i0l1ce/ns_is_a_waste_of_time_my_views/,1.0,['NS somehow make us lag of two years then other ppl who dun serve.\n\nBut I would sae NS also teach u how to work with ppl and deal with ppl or suck thumb and make realise that we need to cherish the freedom we have.']

Buckle in for a wall of text. 

Also this is based on my time, things may have changed. 

**Note to those entering frontline vocation.** 

**Watch out for your mental health. You may develop PSTD after your NS, it depends on the person. It is never easy watching someone die while you are trying to save them. Seek help if you need to, the people in station are those who understand why you are going through. All of us have had to come to terms with some death or near miss while in station. Watching family members break down and cry before you is a humbling experience. Enjoy your time and take care of yourself.**

BRT - basic rescue training 

PTP - physical training phase 

FFC - Fire Fighter course 

SCC - Section Commander Course (Sergeant course)

RCC - Rota commander course (OCS for those in green)

SRU – Special rescue unit

EMT - Emergency medical technician (not to be confused with paramedic)

FF - Fire Fighter 

SC - Section commander 

RC – Rota commander

JO - Junior officer (REC – SWO)

SO – Senior officer (LTA onwards)

NSTI- National Service Training Institute 

CDA – Civil defence academy 

HTTC – Home Team Training Centre  

Rota – Rotation (Shift/ Platoon)

&amp;#x200B;

CDA and NSTI side by side and both are located at Jalan Bahar. Your whole training life is spent in Jalan Bahar. CDA and NSTI are within the same fence but are sperate buildings. Think of NSTI has a chalet and CDA hell. Also NS punishes everyone, so prepare for unfair punishment cause of an idiot somewhere, don’t let it get to you and keep doing your best. After a while you will gain enough brownie points that your SGTs will give you more favourable treatment here and there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Enlistment** 

When you enlist you are sorted into 2 enlistment batch. PTP or BRT. PTP batch will do a 3-month course with 2 months of physical training then 1 last month of Basic Rescue Training (BRT). BRT batch enters at the 2-month mark and will do their BRT together with PTP batch and POP in 4 weeks. The general rule of thumb is that BRT mainly made up of those who passed IPPT. Basically, recruit life in SCDF is streamlined af. Life here is chill and relaxed. Your SGT and PC are all NSF, so you might get to talk shit with them after 1 or 2 months when they ease off your back. 

Bring hangers, underwear, toiletries, detergent and a portable charger. Clothing is provided, get ready to strip to your underwear on the first day in bunk with your platoon to try out your no4 and admin tees (wear a underwear to enlistment, no one wants to see a naked gun on day 1). If there is sizing issues inform your PC and they will work to swap it with the correct size. Cut your hair before entering, if you cut at NSTI you will have to spend the day with itchy small hairs falling into your shirt. Camera phones are allowed, but you will be warned that you are not supposed to take photos and that provost can check your phones if needed. Most of your admin time will be spend playing on your phone, basically 7-10pm, most SGT and PC will not disturb you for playing with your phone in bunk. You will get a good morning and night view of graves, so if you are prone to those things bring some religious amulets or charms. (optional) 

Smoking is not allowed. Possession of lighters and ciggs are considered an offence. People will find a way to smuggle it in, you just need to find the lobang. 

Food is ok. There is a halal and non halal. The one vegetarian I know says his menu sucks and he would queue for the halal menu and take only the veg. Get ready to drink a lot of water from the taps. People get stomach issues almost on a weekly basis, but no one is able to find out why this happens, normally it happens on Saturdays. Never trust your Saturday morning farts. If you are a non-Muslim that eats halal food, bring some papers to proof that you require halal food, the cookhouse aunty and your SGT may need some convincing before they get off your back about why a Chinese needs halal food. Remember to scan your 11B and to wash your hands (don’t be an animal). Menu duration are short, 15 mins to 20mins, so more chewing and less talking.

As a BRT batch you basically book out 2 times and you POP and enter vocation training. Physical training in BRT is almost nonexistent, you come in and learn some basic rescue equipment, marching and POP. Recently there is a change where a group of people are selected at enlistment to enter directly into SCC and start vocational training as SC, I am unsure about the enlistment process for this group. BRT involves learning how to use chainsaws, jacks and some power tools. Learn and forget, you will not touch most of them after entering vocational training. You will be taught how to use the important ones again in vocational training. 

There will be 4 company, made of around 4 platoons of about 40 people. Very small compared to army. Delta coy is for overweight NSF, you will know it is them. No girls in NSTI, female regulars undergo their enlistment training at CDA. REC life is spent in NSTI, enjoy your time here. Perks of SCDF is free washing machines and dryers if your company or rota don’t fuck it up. You should be able to sort out some schedule with the platoon on how to schedule the washings. I spent 1 year in training and never had to go a day with dirty clothes or hand washing clothes. As a REC just keep your head down and follow the instructions. If you want, you can try to earn some awards at NSTI. Best in rescue skills, best in theory, best in physical skills, best in company/platoon. Awards do not play a factor in your eventual vocation I think, my platoon was randomly assigned vocations based on our bunk bed arrangement. Tell your SGT and PC your preferred vocation choice but do not pin your hopes on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Vocation training** 

If you are combat fit (PES A or B) you are almost guaranteed to enter frontline vocation, EMT or FF. Other vocation includes Provost (everyone’s favourite house guest), admin boys and drivers. There may be some I miss out, but these are the main ones.

Admin boys. You either sit around playing ML for hours on end or you get placed under some high ranker and will have to work as a pseudo secretary. Everyone will shit on you for not doing work and you will be surrounded by delta boys and other non-combat fit PES people. You could be assigned to Divisions, HQ, CDA/NSTI or to stations. (If you want more details on the structure, I can put it in the comment upon request)

EMT makes up the minority of frontline vocations. You get your standard rank pay + $300 as your ops pays regardless of rank and some meal allowance.  You will undergo a 1-month course at CDA to get your EMT specialist tag and be shipped off to fire stations or to NSTI MO. Prepare to shoot some IV into your veins and learn medical protocols. 

Firefighting takes the remaining frontline vocations. Standard station pay for FF is your rank pay + $400 +$150 meal allowance. If your OCS friends talk about their shitty training just wipe out your extra $550 and give them one good slap. As a LCP you can earn about the same as a SAF LTA. Make some good financial choices, learn to drive or ride. 

3 main courses, FFC, SCC and RCC. All these courses include a 1month basic firefighting training (BFFT). BFFT will be tough and nothing like NSTI. They will hit you hard in BFFT and you will do your first taste of bunker training. Some people faint on the first day from the heat, some never get used to the bunker gear and will OOC. My only advice is to drink up and sleep early. Don’t think about the days, just think about getting to the next meal and man mode and acclimatise to the heat. 

Cup noodles and 100 plus are now a currency. If your enciks allow its, bring them and ration it out during the week. Someone will have stock of other snacks around, again find the lobang. Or become the lobang. $3 for 1 cup noodle is good profit margin. 

The 1st month is BFFT and your official course is not set in stone yet. There is a total of 6 Rotas, 1-4 are FFC Rota and 5-6 are SCC Rota. During the end of BFFT they will shuffle those with leadership potential into 5 and 6 and the 2 courses will separate and follow their own schedule.  

FFC – 3months course (1-month BFFT, 2 months FFC). You POP with LCP rank. Get ready to be screw all day every day. Your job as a FF is to send the body, so they are going to throw a lot of physical training in to get you ready. Prepare to be treated like shit. My time had unlimited water parade/ happy hour (drink till you puke). Understand what a green gate is and prepare to shout a lot and carry weight. When you POP the top 4 or 5 of each FFC rota will be given the opportunity to crossover into SCC senior bar term. Easiest way to achieve this is to work hard and get a good IPPT score. If you top your Rota in IPPT score you have a good chance of scoring high and being offered SCC. People here are a mixed bag, you get the full range of 20-year-old fathers to JC kids. 

SCC – 5 months course. There is a junior and senior bar term. Junior bar is quite similar to FFC and you will be doing more physical training. After 2 months you will enter your senior bar or professional term. At this point the FFC crossover will enter SCC. During your final term you will have lessons on more specialized topics or Urban Search and Rescue, Hazmat and Marine firefighting. A lot of theory so be prepared to study during admin hours for term test. You will have scenario drills and final exercise where you will be assessed by the enciks from station. 4 awards to be won are overall best trainee, best in practical, best in theory and best in physical training. Awards don’t affect anything but getting an award mean you would be in the top 10% of your SCC and will be given the chance to crossover to RCC. People here are a bit more motivated to get into a frontline vocation, quite refreshing from the typical NS attitude. 

RCC – 7 months course. The course people are made up of international trainees and NSF from SCDF and SAF. Around 20 of them will be those who don’t make the cut for OCS and will be moved to SCDF after their 3-month BMT in SAF. A lot of salty egos in this group, a good number of them bring along the SAF NSF mindset of just doing the bear minimum. Around 5 will be international trainees, prepare to work around their language barrier but they generally know what they are doing. Some of them may have years of experience in service back in their country. And around 10 regulars. 

First 2-3 months is similar to FFC. If you are a crossover from SCC you will enter at the 3month mark. You would have spent around 1 to 4 months in your previous vocation which could be a station. The experience helps a lot and the regulars in RCC may look to you for help and guidance. Be prepared to carry some parts of the course. The content is similar to SCC except the hazmat section is beefed up and you will obtain a hazmat specialist tag on POP. Super boring relearning everything but there will be more scenario drills. 

POTENTIALLY you could POP 4 times, BRT, FFC, SCC, RCC. It has happened before, so work hard in CDA if you want to move up the ranks.

For all 3 courses you will have to do your BAPT, IPPT and H&amp;H to POP. If you move from FFC to RCC it means you have to do all of them at least 3 times. It sucks. 

BAPT – Breathing apparatus test. You have 4 physical exercise stations and a maze. The maze is super easy. 3 of the exercises are easy to pass, the main killer is the endless ladder. You must pass all 4 stations and exit the maze to pass all while controlling your breathing and making sure you do not consume too much air. Learn to be hyper conscious of your breathing rates and practise skip breathing. 

H&amp;H – heat and humidity. They will hit you with a physical exercise designed to stress you out and make you sweat. Afterwards you enter a sauna and do more exercise, the heat will get to your head but try to keep calm and endure the steam and heat. It also gives a good experience of what actual firefighting is like. People have peed their pants and fought each other to get out of the sauna. 

Bonus point is that during the hazmat weeks you will be gassed in a gas chamber. 

Also for RCC and SCC you will obtain a Fire Safety Manager Diploma and WSQ certs. Keep them, they can be used to find work outside. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Posting**

Learn what you can in CDA and prepare to learn more in station. Every Station and rota has their own culture and how to run calls. CDA will never be able to teach you everything so be humble when you enter station.

For EMT you will enter station or NSTI MO. Rank progression is slower than fire side. Work is tough, hours are bad. Get ready to see everything about a human body. You work 12 hours shifts at station along side your paramedic and a driver. Just take cue from the paramedic on what to do. 

For fire side 

After POP you either enter land station, SRU or marine. 

There is a separate specialist course all marine FF have to do and you will be assigned to fight fire from and on ships. 

SRU is an interesting place, used to be a rabz place but things have gotten better. Take care of yourself if you enter SRU, ragging may still be happening there. 

You work 24 hours and get 48 hours to rest. You maybe be arrowed random events that may eat your first day off. Culture is different for every station and every rota. 

After you POP from FFC you enter your posting as a FF. Congrats you are now the rank and file of your posting, prepare to do all the shitty work until you get your new juniors 3 months later. Enciks will target you with a lot of questions and task until they see that you can be trusted to know what to do on a fire ground. AKA boy period of 3 months. Learn fast and be smart. You get to ride the red rhino, fire engines and take all the aku bomba (fire emoji) selfies you want. 

For SCC you will enter as a SC, you can enter the above-mentioned frontline vocations or remain in CDA and NSTI as instructors. Instructor will take a 50% cut to their $400 ops pay. As a SC you now have more responsibility and will have to actively make calls and decision on incidents. Some of it may involve human lives or property so be prepared for it. You could ask your encik for guidance but some situations you have to make the calls. 

For RCC there is very limited slots to enter back into frontline. Every course there is only about 10 station that would take in a NSF LTA, so you will have to compete with the other NSF in your course for it. Luckily most of the SAF boys will want to go staff posting, so try your luck. As a RC in station prepare to work and work. You are now a regular with NSF pay, your name will appear on official documents and you will be in charge of fire investigations and putting up fire reports for people to make insurance claims. You are directly in charge of around 40 people and making sure they go home to their families. There is a lot of things to learn and a lot of staff work to do on top of your frontline operations. Do have to do audits for companies and be prepared to become a working professional and deal with important people from external companies. Your work is more akin to working 48 hours and resting 24 hours.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/jnvclq/everything_you_need_to_know_about_enlistment_in/,1.0,['the website talked about some courts to play sports. is the sports culture there very common?

The thing that is holding me back from gg to sign on is the following:
- abit above avg A level results, and can't really fight all the scholars
- physically not that fit(maybe just lazy) , never got gold in 2nd year(only can use Eliss)
- cadet (ocs) performance actually not that great....
- feel like the culture in SAF might be good in some units but toxic in other units, hence the fear of ending up under bad superiors and hating my shit life without being able to move around. 
-the pay I can fetch in any civil service is probably gonna be significantly lesser than the private sector given the above as well....

But now I really just miss putting on my boots, ilbv and field pack and gg for a walk. And I also miss the camaraderie that I had with some of my commanders and other peers

TBH as I'm typing this I'm also realizing the amount of stress injury/aches/pains that I used to have isn't there anymore and is probably the reason I'm thinking abt gg back? Maybe if I'm physically feeling all the bullshit my body has to go through again then I won't wanna do it as much anymore?

7,NationalServiceSG,3182,Dying culture and traditions in the military,hgbdvh,coachman11,1593190765,7,9,"This is going to be a long post, but here goes. It all started when I was in a meeting with the unit commanders, and I decided to acknowledge my trainer just by his appointment only, no rank no name. An encik caught on to this and gave me a lecture about how we should address people properly, by their appointment and title, or with names and so on. For example, you can call a warrant officer by ""Trainer Encik Tan"", ""Encik Tan"", or ""warrant Tan""  and never ""Trainer"", ""Trainer Tan"" or even worse, ""2nd warrant officer Tan Ah Kow"".

While he was giving me this lecture, another trainer (lets call him WO Tan) overheard our conversation and decided to chime in. WO Tan was saying how traditions and cultures such as calling your superiors are dying.

He somehow started off by ranting about the ration box. WO Tan absolutely HATES the idea of ration box because somehow or rather he blames it for causing one of such military cultures to die out. Turns out in the past, out-ration was not as efficient as it was today; Someone would bring big pots of food and the battalion will collect food with their mess tins. Usually the ones serving the food would be the leaders: your SCs, PCs, OC and so on (something like your recruits' night). After the last guy gets his food, the leaders will then eat off what is left in the pot. Sometimes food will run out and they have to come up with some way or another to satisfy their hunger; 5 oranges and so on. Furthermore, those pots that were delivered over will have a designated place for it to settle properly (i.e. a table) . The reason behind is that the men in the battalion are the ones sacrificing their lives to fight in the event a war breaks out, and the least we could do is to not place it on the floor or any "" derogatory"" surfaces; and I quote from WO Tan: ""You put the food on the floor like some fucking dog food meh, when the button press these soldiers are the ones sacrificing their lives for us you know, and you still dare to put it on the floor ask them collect and eat like dog food is it?!"".

This got me thinking about how cultures like servant leadership, leaders eat last, and respect for all mentality can be practiced today, as it has been adopted in the past (especially during the hokkien peng generation).

The next topic WO Tan went to was how we address people. As a military habit, he emphasized that we should acknowledge the presence of military personnel we are acquainted with, regardless of rank. Looking back, every time I meet WO Tan during the day he would be the first to greet me before I do (even though he outranks me by many times). WO Tan explained that it is a form of human decency and respect, and I quote: ""You wouldn't want the other party to feel like shit and question himself why did he not acknowledge my presence, am I invisible to him? Is he unhappy with me?"". He said that a simple gesture such as addressing the presence of the other party will do, or a simple nod instead of trying to siam eye contact and detour or avoid them (which I am guilty of).

Although most of us are raised to address our elders when we meet them such as our uncles and aunties we tend to forget why we do so. Furthermore, some of us are to also ""notify"" them to eat during meal times, as it was a form of respect for the elders to eat first.

All in all, I somehow got a fruitful takeaway by calling a superior just by the appointment itself. I would agree that these traditions and habits have to be cultivated and upheld in the military as it is a form of character development and respect. Even though most of us are already brought up with such cultures, we are also to understand why we are practicing such habits and not doing it for the sake of it, just like Ashram Cat. If you do not know what Ashram Cat is, I'll save that story for another time :)

Its really frustrating and it kills my motivation to carry on in this course.

I didn't understand what he scolded me so i asked my malay friends and they told me he was toxic and asked if I should consider changing instructor (I'm a chinese btw) but I refused because I wanted to have an experience with the worst instructor than my friends (who had better, much more patient &amp; kind to teach)\n\nMy first lesson on the road was pretty bad tbh, I almost swerve onto the right lane because I see oncoming vehicle and I was nervous and didn't know what to do, the instructor nagged at me that my observation skills was bad and ask me if I learn anything in the circuit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I am posting this here?**

To inform people who have been following the story about the end-result of the August-September fight to reduce the crowd on campus. Also to share with uninitiated readers of the overly bureaucratic process of trying to get the administration to understand what is happening on the ground. 

**Why did I approach the administration?**

I was worried about the health of my family members, some of whom are very frail with dementia or chemotherapy related side effects. Friends were also worried about the health of their family members. Some even had their parents ask them if they really needed to go to school, reflecting parental concern about the crowing situation on campus. 

 **What will this thread cover?**

This thread will present mostly the timeline of the process and facts relating to it. I will try my best to omit any personal opinions to allow readers to come to their own conclusion. I sincerely apologize to anyone who gets offended when they come across any unsavory stuff regarding NTU. However, I believe that we can love our University and at the same time be objective enough to discuss its shortcomings. 

There are restrictions to what I can or cannot share. For example official emails with NTU staff, or meeting transcripts can't be shared, but I will make a short summary out of it. 

# Background story

Since the start of the semester, the campus has been filled with crowds as students try to occupy study areas for their online lessons on campus. It sounds stupid to attend online lessons on campus because it defeats the purpose, but we don't have much of a choice if students have a mix of both online and physical lessons in a day with little breaks between them. Having to attend online lessons in public areas with high foot traffic further lowered the quality of education for us. The campus looked as if it was pre-pandemic times with common areas, food establishments and bus stops flooded with students. 

From [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gjgtzd/uni_ntu_school_of_biological_sciences_ama/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), we can appreciate that no other tertiary educational institute in Singapore faced such crowds on their campus. \[Opinion\] Only here in NTU, where the measures were [lackluster and ineffective](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/innb7t/table_of_ntu_precautionary_measures_and_their/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) we were forced to waddle in a health hazard.

* Disagreed with the campus being crowded, citing their 3 hourly student leader patrols from 9-6pm during week 2 of this semester 
   * Obviously you you will not see the full picture if you walk around at the hourly mark where students are in classes. The crowds start to appear at XX:20 to XX:40 every hour where students arrive for or leave their classes

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

It is my personal opinion that the administration does not see itself to be accountable to the student body, given that they could not even keep the simple promise of sending out an email. 

We students should not solely rely on the Student Union representatives to push the administration for answers or accountability as their power is limited to their willingness to ask difficult questions. We students have a responsibility to push both the University administration for accountability and also to push our Student Union to represent our voice.
