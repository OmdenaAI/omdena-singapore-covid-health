0,SGExams,27427,[A levels] Wuhan Virus in VJC,f0brmg,mousehunt123,1581088374,40,1,"apologies if this is the wrong thread, but just had to let this out...

&amp;#x200B;

there are already 33 confirmed cases of this novel-Coronavirus islandwide. and to my greatest fear, one of these cases just had to be in my school (VJC). in light of this, why hasn‚Äôt MOE started closing schools?  


drawing parallels with another country, Hong Kong (which shares a similar population density as us) has already declared an citywide emergency and started closing down schools in order to limit the spread of the virus after having 5 confirmed cases. This number pales in comparison to that of Singapore‚Äôs, yet the incumbent government seems be employing a ‚Äúsofter ‚Äú approach in dealing with this crisis.  


in the context of VJC, the teacher left the school on Jan 31, which, optimistically, was the last day the teacher interacted with her colleagues and students in the school compound. The incubation period for this virus is 1-2 weeks. By forcing us to to attend school this coming Monday (10 Feb), the school is running the risk of allowing interactions between potential virus carriers who have yet to exhibit symptoms of the virus and healthy students.  


Yes, the school administration has implemented a host of measures to combat this, such as alternative lecture seating arrangements (which mandate a seat between students), disinfecting of rooms that the teacher was thought to be teaching in, suspension of CCA sessions and blah blah. But to what extent will these solutions work effectively? Are these able to effectively ensure zero interaction between the infected and the healthy?¬† So as long as students see each other, there will be infinitely many avenues for students to interact and mingle with each other (during class, breaktimes, after school etc.)  


So why is the school administration running the risk? For learning/results?  


Wouldn‚Äôt it be more optimal to wait for the incubation period be over? Wouldn‚Äôt it more optimal to close schools while hiring professionals to disinfect the whole school compound to leave no stone unturned?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f0brmg/a_levels_wuhan_virus_in_vjc/,0.0,"['Hi!

Petition to MOE

As of 8/3/2020, COVID-19 has started worsening significantly with new cases hitting double digits and new clusters starting to form, after consecutive days of staying in the 1s and 2s. Schools being a location of mass gathering provide a habitat for large scale transmission of the virus, despite temperature taking and other precautionary measures taken, as the virus can still spread from asymptomatic (not showing symptoms) people. 

Singapore schools are capable of implementing E-learning already followed in some Secondary schools and JCs. This minimises large scale transmission üè†

2,SGExams,29931,[JC] Coping with JC while recovering,fepdk3,Testing350500_rdt,1583551617,1,1,"Hello! I'm a J1 this year and I would like to seek advice on how to manage my time such that I can study and revise well while recovering from mental illness.

So a little about what happened, I experienced a period of depression along with symptoms of psychosis prior to the start of sec 4. These symptoms only eased off near to prelims and thankfully I managed to do decently well for my O-Levels. However,  I'm still recovering and at the same time, I'm having to adjust to JC.

I am thankfull that I am coping well with the leap in academic rigour as I understand what is taught in tutorials and lectures, however, I have noticed that I have started to lack behind in actually getting work done when I am back home. 

This is because I find myself having pockets of 'down time' when I experience episodes of lingering symptoms such as unease for no apparent reason as well all trouble thinking clearly though I have ensured that my work environment is optimised for studying.        (E.g no distractions, good ventilation and proper posture)



TLDR: I'm recovering from undiagnosed mental illness and have since been recovering well and am still a perfectly normal person. 

However, symptoms still resurface occasionally and because of that, I loose time waiting for the symptoms to clear before I can resume studying after school.

I'm in JC 1 and coping well with the more rigourous syllabus but I need some advice on how to manage my time to overcome this issue that I face as because of it, I'm starting to find it hard to finish each day's work/be productive.





I'm hoping that anyone out there who may have been through a similar experience can offer some tips on how to be productive.

# 1 Curriculum

## 1.1 NUS Nursing

## Curriculum overview

Generally, the first 2 years we focus on learning the different body systems, how they function (Anatomy &amp; Physiology) and dysfunction (Pathophysiology), coupled with each condition‚Äôs nursing management and hands-on skills. Interesting modules will also be taught such as communicating effectively and being culturally sensitive in the clinical setting, basic psychology for nurses, mental health nursing, and even ethics and law. The 3rd (and final year for most) will focus more on gearing us for eventual practice in the clinical setting with modules tackling leadership and community health. Finally, we will embark on a 3-month final clinical placement to emulate the real pace and nature of work, ensuring that we are competent to practice as registered nurses upon completion.

For people who can and choose to finish with an Honours degree, they embark on a year-long research project usually in their area of interest. Faculty staff members and hospital staff will act as mentors for these projects. Some examples of research projects can be found here: [https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/Project-list-AY2018-19.pdf](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/Project-list-AY2018-19.pdf)

***Difference between honors and without honors:***

* Basic monthly starting pay for some hospitals are different, may vary from $50-100 according the the annual graduate employment survey here: [https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf)
* Some overseas masters/PhD programmes require either an honours degree (directly)¬† or a normal bachelor‚Äôs degree with at least a few years of clinical experience
* Some hospitals/employers may view an honours degree more favourably in terms of salary and/or career progression

Complete information here on the NUS Nursing website, subject to changes every year: [https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/education/bachelor-of-science-nursing-bachelor-of-science-nursing-honours/academic-information/](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/education/bachelor-of-science-nursing-bachelor-of-science-nursing-honours/academic-information/)

## Day-to-day lessons

Fun! We have fake FULL wards in school where we learn all the nursing skills, practice on mannequins that can breathe and have pulses etc. We also have these people called standardized patients who are trained actors for us to practice our communication skills. They act like real patients with real symptoms and real family issues!

## Lectures and tutorials

Some lectures are video lectures - can watch at home at the pace you want! School is only around 3 MAX 4 days a week, only 2-4hrs of lessons each day. Plenty of time to work or have CCAs. But of course, there are e-lectures to watch and tutorials to do and textbooks to read, so it‚Äôs not like you won‚Äôt have to do much studying outside those 2-4hrs/day. But if you manage your time well, it‚Äôs alright!

## For those worried about having no bio background:

There are people in Nursing who haven‚Äôt done bio since sec 1/2, and from poly who did non-science courses such as international business or mass communication.

The kind of bio that we learn is different from H2 Bio. H2 Bio deals with the very minute things like oxidative phosphorylation and ETC and Krebs cycle and all its small molecules. However, we deal with humans here. Human anatomy and physiology, the human body and how it dysfunctions. The anatomy and physiology mods are pretty similar to secondary school bio - you learn about the heart and how the blood flows in general, as well as how it dysfunctions. However, we don‚Äôt delve too deep into the molecules at all - that‚Äôs for the medical students to do. Yes, there will be a LOT of medical terms, and you have to be ready for that if you join nursing or any healthcare-related field, honestly. It‚Äôs hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, it will come naturally :)

Just like learning a new language, the bio content in nursing is like that. Once you learn the alphabets, the phonetics, you can start stringing words together. Nursing doesn‚Äôt delve into the very minute things like molecules and stuff, so no worries.

## For those scared of blood

During nursing school: We have cadaveric sessions - this means that you get to see real, preserved human bodies and you are required to touch and observe them, texture and all, during those anatomy sessions. They don‚Äôt look like normal fresh organs anymore - you can search some ‚Äúscience cadavers‚Äù to see what they look like! As for blood, generally you have to be alright with the sight of it as your first lab session will already have a finger-prick glucose test that you do on your friend (and vice versa). During clinicals, you will be exposed to wounds that may be huge and bleeding, etc, so you have to be okay with it. I do have some friends who enter nursing and medicine who are afraid of blood and needles and things like that - you can get used to it, through repeated exposure.

As a real nurse: You have to be alright with these sights as there of course may be some instances where the patient vomits blood/starts bleeding from somewhere and you have to manage the patient. If you are scared of blood and get posted to the operating theatre as an OT nurse, then you will be assisting doctors in surgeries where you WILL see these. I suggest you try to watch some youtube videos to see if you can take it. Do know that you can get used to it!! Bottomline is, you can‚Äôt be afraid of your own job.

## Lecturers/tutors

All teaching staff in ALCNS are previously doctors, nurses or pharmacists (for pharmacology). Usually, our heavily science-based modules are taught by previous doctors (eg: anatomy and physiology, pathophysiology), whereas more nursing-based modules are taught by previous or current nurses. This honestly helps a lot as our lecturers and tutors have had vast experiences in the clinical world, and therefore better able to relate what they teach with the clinical setting.

## Clinical placements

Do note that NUS Nursing students (and all other nursing students in the country) are very special. For every university holiday, half of it will be spent in the wards (eg if 3 months break, 1.5 months in the wards). But you will be reimbursed (paid) for the whole duration of placements!

## 1.2 Nursing degree vs diploma (polytechnic)

Main differences would be the pay, how fast you get promoted, and the jobscopes. For the pay, the difference will be around $800-1000 monthly, depending on the hospital (based on this [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-poly-graduates-employed-six-months-after-graduation-with-12261278](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-poly-graduates-employed-six-months-after-graduation-with-12261278) and this [https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf)). You will come out as staff nurse I with degree, and staff nurse II with diploma (I is higher than II). I is only one position away from senior staff nurse (so promotion is faster, pay goes up faster etc). For pay, degree holders earn about $3,500 a month, which is the same as Pharmacy degree holders. From government employment data from last year, Life Science degrees/Arts degree holders earn only about $3100-3300 a month on average (just refer to the MOE website above).

# 

# 2. NUS Nursing student life opportunities

## 2.1 Unrestricted Electives

You are required/allowed to take a minimum of 2 (for bachelor‚Äôs degree) or 3 (for honours degree) unrestricted elective modules outside of the faculty for the duration that you are in NUS. That means that you can take almost any module of your liking, like French, Astronomy, Forensic Science, Drama, Philosophy, etc. This allows us to explore our interests outside the nursing curriculum.

## 2.2 Local and Overseas Community Involvement Programmes

The Faculty of Medicine (Medicine and Nursing) has a lot of student-initiated CIPs both locally and overseas. You can join many things, from conducting free basic health checks in the neighbourhood, to volunteering with patients with dementia at a community hospital, to teaching basic first aid and english lessons to kids overseas - there‚Äôs really a lot of opportunities for us to give back to the community. Furthermore, you get to work with the medical students too as most of these projects are jointly planned and executed by both nursing and medicine students.

## 2.3 Student Leadership Opportunities

Similar to ‚Äústudent council‚Äù in secondary/JC, you can join the Nursing Subclub, Mednurse Club or SNASC to champion your peers‚Äô causes and hopefully make a difference in their lives and in the profession of nursing. Other leadership opportunities include but not limited to: leading CIPs, organizing freshmen orientation, nurses‚Äô day etc..

## 2.4 Exchange Programmes

ALCNS partners with several universities in different countries worldwide for student exchange programmes. Some countries include: Japan, Switzerland, Taiwan, Indonesia, Korea, etc. The exchange programmes may occur during school time or vacation time, and usually lasts 1-4 weeks. Selection process is through application and is based on the student‚Äôs own merit (academic and portfolio, contribution to the school).

# 

# 3 Admission Information

## 3.1 Indicative Grade Profiles

## A Levels 2019

10th percentile: CCD/B

90th percentile: AAA/A

## Polytechnic GPA 2019

10th percentile: 3.33/4.0

90th percentile: 3.86/4.0

## 3.2 Admission Interviews

Not for everyone. Usually only done for people with rp near the cut-off point, to prove that you are not joining nursing purely because you can‚Äôt apply to any other course with your grades. This will weed out people who have absolutely no idea about nor passion for nursing. There are people who get in with lower rp than the IGP, but please put Nursing as 1st choice as that is a factor too. The format is somewhat like a panel interview, with 1 or 2 faculty members as your interviewers. 15-30min each.

## Tips

Be prepared but do not memorize a script. Just think through the usual interview questions and some of these additional questions below. I came up with this questions, it is in no way supposed to be representative of what the school will definitely ask. This can be used for any interview/personal statement.

Motivation: Why nursing? Why healthcare?

Exploration: What have you done to cultivate this passion? Hospital attachments? Job shadowings? Talking to nurses? What did you learn?

Suitability: from your exploration, do you think that you, as a person, with your character and attitude, are fit to be a nurse? How so?

Also one qn they may ask: where do you see yourself 10 years from now? You then flex your knowledge of the 3 nursing tracks and where you intend to go.

## 3.3 Scholarships

There are 2 kinds of ‚Äúscholarships‚Äù - one is called MOH Scholarship and the other is called hospital sponsorship. The differences are below. There are also available financial help from NUS and ALCNS itself. Please refer to the NUS/ALCNS website for more information.

## MOH Scholarship

* pays for tuition fees, hostel fees, book and computer allowance
* gives you $1,100 a month (given in 6-monthly basis)
* PROS: money
* CONS: you can only put preference for a healthcare cluster, you cannot choose which hospital you wanna work at. Also, harder to get (requires excellent A Level grades (usually &gt;85 rp from what I heard) and &gt;4.0/5.0 CAP for mid-term scholarship.

## Hospital Sponsorships

* gives you $1,000 a month
* PRO: you can choose your hospital. Eg some of my classmates want to work as a paeds nurse next time, so they take sponsorship from KK hospital! Also, easier to get.
* CONS: does not pay for anything else, just monthly allowance

You don‚Äôt need to decide whether you want to take a scholarship now. Many people go for clinicals for some hospitals for 1/2yrs to see which hospital they want to get sponsored by.

# 

# 4 Nature of Work

## 4.1 Job Scope

As for job scope, you go in as SN I as mentioned earlier, which is more senior than SN II, Enrolled Nurses, healthcare attendants, etc. The implication is that you will be usually the main person in charge of a cubicle, for example, with around 4-8 patients at any given time, updating the family members, doctors, other healthcare professionals.

## DO WE JUST WASH BUTTS?

I love this question about the stigma hehe. Okay anyway, the seemingly ‚Äúdirty‚Äù jobs like cleaning butts and bathing patients and changing diapers MAY not be done (or not usually done) by staff nurses - it is usually done by nursing aides/nursing assistants/enrolled nurses.

Staff nurses‚Äô \*main\* roles are as follows:

1. Dispense medications. You will be the last check bw the dr‚Äôs orders and the pt. Some drs may order the wrong dose or wrong meds due to fatigue - the onus is on you to check whether the drug is appropriate for the patient (some drugs for heart failure cannot be used for diabetic pts etc).
2. You are THE EYES. IC of assessment of patient - skin integrity, making sure that the patient is well during the hospital stay in general. We spend the most time with patients - hence, we are the perfect people to see any subtle changes in their conditions. Side effects of medications. Psychological state. Family/patient concerns. All these subtle changes, if needed, should be immediately escalated to the doctor for further treatment.
3. Patient and family education - we spend the most time with patients. Doctors are only there for about 5min a day, hence any qns will be directed at you. Eg: ‚Äúnurse! Why does my father have an IV drip???‚Äù - have to explain that it‚Äôs because he needs to be hydrated etc as he cannot take anything by mouth before surgery etc.

Sometimes SNs may get assigned (or just do) the ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù duties due to reasons such as understaffing or skin integrity assessment. That‚Äôs honestly good, to remain competent with basic nursing care of the patients such as helping with activities of daily living (bathing, toileting, etc).

## 4.2 Salary

Nursing is actually one of the highest paid degrees in the market.¬†

As mentioned earlier, refer here:¬†

[https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf)

## 4.3 Career progression

There are 3 different tracks that nurses can pursue after a basic bachelor‚Äôs degree. After working for about maybe 1-3 years, you can take an advanced diploma or master‚Äôs degree then pursue one of the 3 tracks.¬†

They are: management, clinical and education tracks.¬†

Management - in charge of the ward, the staff, troubleshooting patient staff probs, patient patient probs, staff staff problems etc, admin stuff.

Clinical - called Advanced Practice Nurses, they will be like ‚Äúmini doctors‚Äù. If you don‚Äôt know, some clinics in the polyclinics are PURELY run by nurses alone - they can manage diseases like diabetes, hypertension etc and prescribe meds (must take extra course) without doctors. The only thing they cannot do will be surgery.¬†

Education - come back to the nursing polys/nus to teach.¬†

Occasionally, some people do clinical and education for example, this is called joint appointments. So please, let your parents know that degree nursing is really not about washing butts anymore! :)

&amp;#x200B;

# 5 Other common questions

## 5.1 Medicine vs nursing

**Know that: doctors cure, nurses care.** So everything we learn is geared towards our roles. While doctors learn much, much more in-depth stuff to pinpoint what is the dysfunction in the body exactly, nurses learn just enough so that we are able to catch any potential mistakes. For example, sometimes medications are mistakenly ordered when patients have drug allergies, or when patients have other conditions that are contraindicated for that drug. Nurses play a big role in knowing the general science so as to prevent such fatal mistakes. Short answer for theory: Medicine delves deep, deep, and wide, while nurses generally just learn the basics, good enough to catch mistakes but not deep enough to the point that we are able to treat diseases with multiple complications for example!

Also, when a patient walks in with a limp, a doctor will zoom straight into the condition. Eg: what meds can I give or surgery can I do to cure this patient? If the same patient walks into the room, nurses will look at the patient and family. Eg: He is limping, how will I help him up the bed? How will this affect his job? His family? Does he have children? What will the side effects of the meds/surgery be? Will he be able to cope?

So ask yourself, which role do you want to play?

## 5.2 Why NOT nursing?

This is not a why NOT nursing, but someone asked me if there‚Äôs anything that made me want to turn away from Nursing. From my convos with many nurses in the wards, it‚Äôs mostly these:

1. You will inevitably get attached to some pts, especially if you work as a community hospital nurse where pts there stay for 3 months or more, as compared to acute hospitals where they stay for only 3-4 days. So you have to be prepared for deaths because everybody dies eventually. While doing that, try not to get too desensitized too to the point that you lose your humanity. However, it is a privilege to be there with people in their last breaths.
2. Sick people are angry people, their relatives are angry too. Be mentally prepared to be scolded and criticized (but SG law protects healthcare workers from physical and verbal abuse). But still. However, the satisfaction is worth it when they show gratitude after recovery :)
3. Nursing is an extremely tiring job, physically and emotionally. Be prepared to work long hours with limited time for your own needs such as food or even simply toileting. While it is my intention to elevate the profession of nursing by addressing stigmas, I do not intend to over glorify the profession and give everyone the false hope that nursing is very fun and easy. It takes real guts and strength to be a nurse, and you should only join if you think you are up for the challenge to learn and push yourself.

## 5.3 Overseas nursing

I think different countries and THEN different schools have different niche areas that they focus on. For example, we import a lot of nurses from other Asian countries - firstly because they are extremely good with their skills even though the labour cost is relatively cheaper as compared to poly/nus/sit nursing graduates from Singapore. The Singapore nursing schools - ie poly/SIT and especially NUS Nursing, are trying to produce nursing leaders of the future in Singapore. Hence, on top of hands-on skills, the focus will be on cultivating that ability to lead the healthcare team that they are part of - cuz indeed, as a fresh grad, you are already in the same position as foreign nurses who may have years and years of experiences more than you.

There‚Äôs also a flip side of the coin. In other parts of the world, that is. Nursing in the US, UK, Australia, from what I heard, have much more autonomy than nurses here in Singapore - they are generally able to do more. If I‚Äôm not wrong, they are called Nurse Practitioners there, similar to our Advanced Practice Nurses in Singapore - with much more autonomy in prescribing meds/doing procedures etc (you can search all about it). Generally, their pay is higher also - but that may be due to the fact that the standard of living is much higher there as well - a fast food meal in the US can easily cost $15.¬†

I think one thing you should ask yourself is, do you want to serve your home country? If yes, you have to settle for the pay here. On tope of that, how do you want to serve your country? An overseas nursing degree, like any overseas course, will offer you insights that you can hopefully translate back to the clinical setting here in Singapore. However, getting a local degree will ensure that you are the most up to date when it comes to the Singapore healthcare system and its current issues.

Bottomline is, it‚Äôs up to you, and what is the most important for you :)

## 5.4 Dealing with deaths as a nurse

I haven‚Äôt personally experienced it as a nurse as I haven‚Äôt been in the wards long enough. However, I will answer based on my personal experience when my grandma passed away, as well as my conversations with other nurses/healthcare professionals.

1. Give yourself time to grieve. We are all humans, with real emotions and feelings. While many many years of being in healthcare may get you used to people dying / being struck with fatal illnesses everyday, someday, you may still encounter a patient whom you may get too attached to and the unthinkable happens. Please, take the time to grieve and reflect. Talk to people who understand.
2. See the bigger picture. I once performed CPR on an elderly lady (not in the hospital - at her house), and she passed on a few days later in the hospital. Though it may seem tragic, since it‚Äôs a death after all, I know that she‚Äôs in a better place now. She does not have to suffer the complexities of her diseases + any broken ribs due to the CPR, if ever.
3. Remember not to be too hard on yourself. Sometimes you may feel that it‚Äôs your fault, for not checking on the patient enough, for missing out the signs. It‚Äôs alright. Everybody makes mistakes and we all learn from them.

4,SGExams,46643,[O Levels] Need some urgent advice regarding my studies,iq11r4,madridsandthearcher,1599735122,3,1,"Hi everyone, 

I‚Äôm a Sec 4 student currently studying in an IP school and would like to ask for opinions on what to do with my current situation

So End Of Year exams are starting in about 2 weeks and I already have my practical examinations next week. However I‚Äôm actually feeling quite unmotivated sometimes and really can‚Äôt make a lot of progress on revision. Like for example I pick up a textbook with the end goal of studying 2 entire topics but in the end I just keep staring at a page in the book for like a very long time. 

This year overall has to be one of my worst years so far in terms of academics I think. Being a person that learns better in the classroom, HBL really did affect me a lot. Moreover, all of my Weighted Assessment grades are on a downward trend. WA1 everything was alright except that I just passed Physics, then I screwed up my English essay and A Math for WA2. And finally, the recent WA3, where my best grade in Science is 60%, I barely passed both A and E Math, and a very rare occurrence happened- my language subjects are now better than my Sciences. 

From what I can recall, I never used to be like this. I‚Äôm not trying to boast or show off any past academic achievements, but I can, for sure, say that for the whole of primary school I was one of the top 5 people in the entire cohort. I could concentrate in class, never had any problems with my studies, except for that one time I didn‚Äôt do too well for Science and failed Higher Chinese. Luckily my Chinese teacher had a sincere talk with me and I ended up improving. 

Fast forward to secondary school. I can also confidently say that for the past 4 years my Grade Point Average has remained almost exactly the same, in the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù range, about 3.4. And I‚Äôve been trying to score a higher GPA for so long but failed every time. It didn‚Äôt exactly help that I was placed into SBGE because of my high T score from PSLE, so the environment was very competitive. I am certain I put in significant effort into my studies, yet I see others constantly scoring higher than me, with many of my classmates having a GPA of 3.8 or 4.0 (the maximum attainable GPA)

Secondary 3 comes around and I‚Äôm no longer in the best class, but I can tell the atmosphere is still very tense and everyone is like the mugging everyday type. And then the same thing happens. Those people with a GPA lower than me in lower sec, are also achieving at least 3.7. While I‚Äôm still at the same GPA. Those friends I knew from lower sec, but who are no longer in the same class as me, as well as my CCA friends have also had their GPAs increase. 

This EOY exams is my last shot and the only chance left to prove myself before I move on to JC. But as I progressed through my secondary school years, I couldn‚Äôt help but start to question if I was suffering from any medical condition, unbeknownst to me. I already see some red flags with what people around me are telling me lately. During HBL my parents say that I got up of my seat way too many times just to get some water or walk around. I study a subject for 5 mins before I get bored and want to do another subject. And most worrying of all, at least 3 of my teachers have told me something along the lines of ‚ÄúHey, what happened to you this WA3? Your paper this time did not score very well you know! You are definitely capable of scoring well because you have so much potential and a very good grasp of the content.‚Äù

I told them that perhaps I didn‚Äôt manage my time properly and ended up not revising all of the tested topics. But I have a feeling that there is a deeper issue that has not been identified. I have tried to talk to my parents about this, and don‚Äôt get me wrong, they are usually very supportive and caring, but they have attributed my poor grades to simply not having a clear goal and not concentrating on my work. Then they refuse to continue the conversation. I know this may not be the right mindset, but at this point I can‚Äôt help but feel jealous that so many people in my cohort have good grades and are popular (like have a lot of friends) at the same time. (My social circle is like almost nonexistent and I‚Äôm alone like 95% of the time haha)

Do yall think what I have described seems to be symptoms pointing to possible anxiety, depression, ADHD etc? Any advice on how to proceed forward from here and get my studies back on track would also be very much appreciated.

i remember preparing for Os this time last year, and feeling like mildly suicidal just because of my cyclical emotional fluctuations. was stressed that my grades were slipping, especially in a particular subject X i used to like ascertain my value as a person and self-worth. i was in a mugggggger class while unmotivated because of a sheer lack of energy. this is really unrelated, but i was a victim of a crime at the beginning of the year in the process of ""getting tips for JC"". i did not have friends. now, i'm  absolutely failing subject X. and i'm realising more and more how trivial grades are. of course this won't stop you from stressing about that upcoming exam. but as i hear stories of my parents' colleagues' children getting into NUS with like (what some may view as) average grades or going somewhere and doing great in life i'm beginning to see that there are so many more paths one can walk down in life. the academic system is no longer as narrow and elitist (i say this in like a career opportunities sense not a social stigma sense)- no one cares if you were from RJC years ago. i suppose it's also counterproductive to push yourself until you break or lose your grip on... the beautiful person you are?? because of grades, which are so, so fleeting and temporary. Olvl six pointers failing JC vvv common, i'd know... IP kids, GEP kids, struggling to promote, also vvv common. it's a chasing after the wind. it's not assured no matter how hard we push ourselves, and yet we still jeopardise our mental health for it. it's a life lesson we come to grips with slowly; what is financial stability without emotional stability? what is er social prowess without that one source of true support? in the same way, i encourage you guys to take care of you, a deserving and wonderful and strong person. take care of your mental and physical health. you'll be a tiny bit more refreshed and calm as you tackle the intimidating mundaneness of your course content. and for what it's worth, i'll just say again that you are not your grades.

i feel like there's increased awareness about mental health, but i've personally yet to see a reduction in stigma. as someone with anxiety and attention deficit disorder, i mask that shit in school because i don't just think i'll get judged; i absolutely know i will. i've seen judgment and i've seen a severe lack of understanding from teachers and classmates about this kinda thing. :( i'm also here to say that if you have a mental condition that affects your ability to concentrate in any way, don't let judgment from peers hinder you from applying for the extra time that you need. those who judge you will never make for bosom friends.

6,SGExams,45267,[A levels] Tuition and retaining?,ifit24,idkwhyimusingthat101,1598245520,9,1,"
So have been diagnosed with ADHD and depression. Not a surprise as I had been seeing the symptoms since my early teens. Tried coping but O levels screwed me over and went to a not-so elite JC, taking A levels this year. My councillor said it‚Äôs best to retain as I slacked throughout the year.

All my symptoms peaked mid-last year where I started slacking but fortunately scraped through my promos. This year I couldn‚Äôt focus or do anything at school. Literally ate, slept and repeated. Unfortunately, my parents are really nice and supportive people but they have to deal with me. They went to the point of taking up extra part time jobs and work pressure so I could afford having to go to 4 atas,expensive tuitions as I told them I‚Äôll study hard and get scholarship. With my conditions and HBL, I would just stare into deep space during lessons.I know to others this might sound lazy but scientifically speaking, ADHD patients have abnormalities in the brain, causing various 
chemical imbalances in turn causing various 
stimuli. This isn‚Äôt just limited to studying too. Fortunately, with the medication,  can actually feel that I have regained my primary school cohort-topping self and actually can complete tasks, that too, retain the information.

Welp, I‚Äôm not here to rant but I am just wondering if I should ask my tuition teachers if I could sit in for their tuition lesson next year without fees after explaining my situation? If you were my tuition teacher, would you let me in? I sibling taking As next year.  I believe it is only right for them to channel their resources into him as I don‚Äôt have the right to undermine his future. Moreover, therapy and medication is not cheap. They would be crushed when they hear my plans of retaining

8,SGExams,35113,[Poly] Week 3 Burnout,gfmb0d,rascaille,1588911996,16,1,"I am currently a Year 1 Nursing student at NYP. I got in through the EAE route, thinking that nursing was the right path to take. I wanted stability after graduating from polytechnic, and my interest in the medical field fooled me into thinking that perhaps nursing was the best option. In truth, I am perfectly fine with the theory parts of this nursing course. It's the ""being a nurse"" part that stuns me. 

I am someone who is highly logical and analytical. I struggle with relating to other people's emotions, and I tend to respond to highly emotional and vulnerable situations with rational thinking and comments which others view as a lack of sympathy. This isn't to say that I do not understand how they're feeling (I am not a sociopath, by any means), it's just that the way I process emotions is different. I do not have the same tenderness and empathy that the other nursing students have. In other words, I am definitely not suited to be a nurse.

It is only the third week of school and I already recognise the symptoms of burnout. I do not enjoy attending classes, regardless if it is via Zoom or not, and every day feels like a burden. I do not see a future in which I am a registered nurse at a hospital. I lack any motivation to do anything even remotely related to school. I dread the day hospital attachments start. I can't even fake being happy when my mother asks me about how school is going.

I don't know what to do. I could transfer courses, but would the fact that I accepted the EAE offer into nursing affect that? Should I just stay in this course and tahan until university (if I can even get into university)? If I do choose to transfer, what is the process like? How long would it take?

We‚Äôre almost done with the first semester (currently taking our finals) and I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm going to fail every paper I‚Äôve taken. I haven‚Äôt done most of the assigned readings/ watched most lectures and I‚Äôve just been falling behind on work since the first day of school. 

Due to my poor mental health (upon encountering a few traumatic experiences this year) it‚Äôs been extremely hard to focus and study with brain fog/ ptsd symptoms clogging up my productivity. At this point I really know that it‚Äôs way too late for me to push up my grades for this semester and the thing about law is that your grades stay with you forever and might affect my chances to take the bar exam in future after I graduate. 

Right now I really want to take a LOA and come back next year to redo the whole year 1 again (so i come back in the first semester of 2021). I believe this would give me a good head start but I really don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just being ‚Äúlazy‚Äù + there‚Äôs so much stigmas against people who have to ‚Äòretain‚Äô and I really don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready for that. Repaying school fees for the first sem might be an issue as I‚Äôm paying for my school fees by myself. 

Does anyone have any advice towards taking LOAs in NUS specifically?

Here are some recommendations:\n\n(1) **Sem's Grades**. If you wish, you can file for a Special Consideration (SC). If your SC is approved, you will receive an Incomplete grade, which does not affect your CAP at all. And, since you are suffering from mental health issues, you will need to visit NUS UHC to get your mental health assessed, and the SC form filled out. Do take note of the deadline for SC though.\n\n(2) **Mental Health**. I recommend that you visit a counsellor / psychologist / psychiatrist to talk about your mental health, if you haven't already done so. Speaking from experience, they have helped me tremendously. NUS UHC is a very good place to start.\n\n(3) **LOA.** When I was going through depression while studying at NUS, I was offered two options, (a) take an LOA; (b) take a reduced load per semester. I know that money is an issue (but see below), but please know that you have other options besides taking a full semester load.\n\n(4) **Finances**. I encourage you to speak with the financial aid advisors at NUS, and file for some financial aid. It is not a difficult process, and you might receive some finaicial relief. Every bit helps.\n\n(5) **Some Reflections**. I don't wish to overstep here. But perhaps you might want to think about whether law is suitable for you, and the reason(s) behind your wanting to study law? Sometimes, as we live our lives, our goals and expectations change. It is perfectly fine to take stock of our lives once in a while, review our options, before moving forward again.\n\nI hope this helps. And may things go smoothly for you! Fighting!""]"
10,SGExams,53421,[A Levels] Confessions and Regrets,jkz0ae,Tragic_Accolades,1604072159,17,1,"30 October 2020, 3 days before D-Day. About time to share certain aspects I never really told anyone before and certain regrets I have about this short 2 years.

Some people reading this might know me irl especially this one guy in my sch so pls don't expose me ty.

I remember coming in to YIJC for the first time on 1 Feb 2019 just a day after receiving my JAE posting via SMS. Wearing my white and black Secondary Sch uniform and wondering if there's anyone else I know who went to YIJC. Talking to myself that day, I promised myself that I would work hard this 2 years and get a spot in LKC School of Medicine at NTU for AY2022. Man, I wished I kept myself to that promise...

From the very first day in YIJC, I already had doubts of ever going to LKCMedicine. Thought to myself on the first day of school to cut my losses and just take CFMg (Further Maths) and applied to take the selection test. Welp that didn't work, I failed the selection test, but on the bright side, my request to do double science was approved by the school. Best of all, I was also granted H1 Geography although I came from a History Elective background. Maybe LKCMedicine is fated for me? Who knows...

Being introduced to my CG and tutors for the next 2 years, we exchanged our introductions and expectations from coming to JC; we shared the doubts we had about A Levels, our O Level results lol, what H1s we took, what PW is gonna be like, etc. My PW tutor shared with me last year that it was during the first 2 weeks of school that the various tutors feedback to her about me was positive, that they thought I had the capacity to be a top student in YIJC. Delusional my tutors are, I thought...

Things went downhill after the first 2 weeks. Honestly nothing about me changed, I was just how I always was since Primary School; I slept during lectures, constantly didn't do my tutorials, came late for sch almost on a daily basis, always forgot to bring the correct subject notes for the day, etc. Remember I stated earlier that I wanted to go to LKCMedicine? You can see how that went...

CA1 came and I was excited to take my first assessment for the year. Did not thing I would do well anyway, but was just curious as towards how my progress in school was and what is the standard required of me for A Levels. Welp, ABS/D (66.25 RP counting in GP and PW) sure is a weird way to start out my JC life. Yes, I got B for Chem and S for Physics. That's what happens when you go from Combined Science to PCM I guess...

Oh and I'm sure everybody remembers the most hated PW? Like as if one member of my group dropping out of school was not bad enough, my group was literally 3 slackers and 1 leader lmao. I still remember what one of my group mates said in August right before our CA2, ""Guys... so y'all know that 2 of us are doing really badly rn (UUU/U). How bout this, let's hold on our PW progress for now and continue after our CAs."" Sound great right? Do bear in mind that we were literally the second slowest group in the school and have not even finished writing the first draft for Chapter 1 of our WR. Some of y'all reading this post might remember an earlier rant I posted a few days ago where I said something about wanting to get a B for PW and doing the bare minimum. I guess that's one thing I regret about my JC1 life, maybe if I had done more, my other 2 group mates could have gotten an A for their PW as well. If y'all are reading this, I'm sorry for being the burden teammate, I really don't deserve getting an A for PW, not like I could control the marking...

Thankfully, all of us promoted. Somehow managed to get ADE/B (67.5 RP factoring in PW and GP) and got promoted to JC2 lol. Seeing how I got an A for Physics, I thought might as well apply for H3 Physics, since I only have 9AUs because I do not take a MTL subject and I need 10AU to apply for scholarships. Ofc got rejected because D for Chem and E for Maths lol. Looking back, I regretted not studying during JC1. Maybe I might have gotten accepted for H3 Physics if I gotten a B for my Maths and Chem lol. If there was anything from my JC life I could change, it would definitely be this. Now I'm stuck in a bad financial position, not being able to afford for Uni, but also not having enough AUs to apply for damn scholarship. And don't bother about 4H2, I took Combined Science so I don't even qualify to apply for 4H2. I wouldn't be in this position right now if I had just studied in my JC1...

Ofc, JC2 was no better. One might have taught that I would buck up and strive to get a merit scholarship but guess who decided to get CDE/U for the first block exam after coming back to school lol. Covid-19 did not help anything either, with me being out of school for 4 weeks after having flu-like symptoms for over a month. Missing a lot of lessons, and the entire fricking chapters on Vectors, electromagnetic induction, and the first 4 chapters of Organic Chem did not help anything (Got BUU/U for the second block exam lol) What did I do in the 1 month I was out from school? Sleep at home the entire day lol. Did I study? No. Did I try to learn the concepts of topics that I missed? No. Did I bother asking my friends what the homework was? No, didn't even intend to do it lol. Came back to school to everyone surprised that I didn't drop out and almost 2kg of papers in the class pigeon hole waiting for my love and attention that they never got. Those 2kg of papers are currently rotting in my cupboard :(

Prelims came soon and it was the last time for me to pull myself up before the A Levels. One might think maybe I would wake up and actually do something. Well yes, but technically no. Got CDU/S (45RP), but was it because I studied? No. Sorry lah, not my fault that Prelim came out an easy paper... 

Snap back to reality, GP is in 3 days and I finally woke up my idea when study break started. If I really want to go to LKCMedicine in AY2022, I really need to get at least 86.25RP and 45 to 86.25 is a really huge jump lol. I am trying to study but honestly I just have no idea what I'm doing. I have never studied before in my entire life since P1 to JC2 and I have no idea what studying is or what it is about. Feels like I'm paddling against the wrath of a waterfall when all I have is a sampan and a spoon. 

What do I regret about my JC life? If you were not able to catch from the dissertation above, here's a short summary:

\- I regret not studying at all in this 2 years  
\- I regret not waking up after failing my core subjects time and time again even until Prelims  
\- I regret not taking JC seriously, not listening to the advice of my tutors,   
\- I regret not taking up that DSA offer to NYJC (I don't think I discussed this above)  
\- I regret not listening to my friends when they told me to buck up on my work as I was super behind the rest of the class  
\- I regret not being a proper group mate in my PW group which might have been the reason the other 2 did not get their A. It sucks enough when I bear the consequences but it sucks more when other suffer because of me :(

To anyone who plans to go to JC after the calamity of O Levels, I hope nobody turns out like me. Take JC seriously, take PW seriously, don't be a burden to your group mates. You may have been able to make it past Primary School and Secondary School from pure intelligence but I'm telling you right now from personal experience, good luck doing that for A Levels. Even the largest water tanks fully drain eventually. 

And atb to everyone taking their A Levels. JC, MI, Private, we are all in the same boat and I hope that y'all can make it to the course of your dreams.

I now have 1 week until my paper 1 for physics and chemistry and I have decided to pick up my PS4 after 3 months. The feeling I got when I turned on my console was the same feeling of looking at homework as a primary school kid. I stopped playing after like 5 minutes due to my brain going into overdrive telling me to stop and study and my entire body feeling itchy and I also felt very irritable. 

Holding the controller in my hand is the most unnatural and disgusting feeling I ever felt even though I fucking love video games. Why I labeled this as ‚Äúwithdrawal symptoms"" is due the similar symptoms. This is the first time I have stopped studying in almost 2 and a half months and I study almost 5 hours a day. Today was the first time I stopped in a while and felt this. To really test if this was something like a withdrawal, I went to my room and did some MCQ papers and 4 hours flew by. I did not feel any dread or boredom while doing the papers, hell I even felt happy and energetic.

Did o level really fuck up my brain to the point I hate the things I love and love the things I hate? Or is this just a one time thing?

I was embarrassed of my condition for a good 2 years before I finally opened up to the closest people around me.

I have kinda 'lost steam' while studying for prelims, partly due to the fact that leading up to prelims I had to go to school everyday. I preferred studying at home during COVID (or going to NLB to mug pre-COVID) and my grades were 10x better studying alone at home and just meeting my teachers for consults online / in school than having to go to school everyday, which ultimately messed my mental health even if I could suppress it during the COVID HBL season. 

I lost sleep, had binge-eating episodes, self-harmed, had suc\*d\*al thoughts - basically did everything I could to forget the shit that I've been put through because of A levels. I remember that there were nights I just looked out of my window and was tempted to leave my house, walk over to the open-air carpark nearby and kill myself, or hoping damn hard that I wouldn't wake up the next morning because I really didn't want to have to go through so much anymore. 

I know what it is like to not have parents / friends trust you. They brush you aside, discount your feelings, make you feel as if you should be the last person to feel like you're depressed / stress, tells you 'I'm feeling depressed too ok!' - that feeling sucks.

I just want to tell you, if you're suffering right now, that there is still a way out of this mess. Seek help, and seek help early. You really don't need to suffer in silence because you need to realise that the more you suffer in silence (especially for people with dysthymia) and the more you try to hide your symptoms, the less people will take you seriously (just like how people around me ignored me when I told them about my condition after 2 years). A levels are coming soon - I know it is tempting to ignore the signs of mental health problems now, but don't wait for a mental health collapse before you do anything about it. Seek help from external organisations if you really need - there are many out there that ensures anonymity and are genuinely willing to help. 

I'm not going to lie and tell you that 'it'll be better' - no, for some people, it just wouldn't. But what I can tell you is that sharing it with someone you know is willing to listen without judgement may just relieve you of the pain you are going through, even if it is just a fleeting moment. Most importantly, I've came to realise, for those who have yet to really suffer from massive stress or any mental health issues, please live a healthy lifestyle and ensure that you have enough breaks in the lead-up to As and not fall into the cycle of stress like I did.

21,SGExams,24726,[A levels] ADHD,e1x2ic,muchmuchtooGREASY,1574769988,50,1,"This isn't a topic that's talked about often, or at all here, but I just wanted to get this off my chest. Gonna be quite long cos it's literally my life story HAHA SORZ 

I'm not officially diagnosed with ADHD, but I do think that I have it. Self-diagnosis is shady af tho, so I do want to have an official diagnosis but it!! Is!! Expensive!! And I can't get my parents on board bc they are adamant that I'm fine.

I see where they are coming from tho, bc ADHD is supposed to be evident from a young age and my life isn't completely in tatters. I did well in pri sch, and wasn't a disruption in class, so my teachers never had anything to complain...except for griping that I was always reading in class, and just not listening ever. I didn't learn much in sch, but was lucky enough to have one-on-one tuition for math and sci so I couldn't not study. I never liked sitting in class, and my fidgeting and leg shaking just wouldn't stop.

Exams were (still are) boring as shit, not bc I knew how to do the qns, but i just didn't want to them bc they weren't exciting and I literally cannot force myself to concentrate. I remember in pri sch during exams I was sitting near the backdoor of the classroom, and instead of doing the paper I would just knock on the backdoor periodically (my poor classmates) to make the invigilator look at the front door and I loved seeing their confusion LOL pri sch me was lame as shit I know 

After pri sch, I went into an IP sch, and things just went downhill from there. My parents decided I didn't need as much parental supervision as pri sch me so they let me dictate my own study pace, schedule etc. Which is cool, except I have zero self-discipline whatsoever. Literally every paper, no matter the importance, that I took in IP, I studied one or two days in advance, if at all. 

Now, the thing about ADHD is not about a lack of self discipline per se, but rather the inability to prioritize things properly bc my brain insists that another thing is fun and interesting, and so we must do it NOW or we will SUFFER and DIE. This is a good time to mention that I'm 18, lol and left with 2 geog papers for my As. And since when has studying been fun and interesting? I'm literally typing this with my arms propped on geog notes. 

As I mentioned previously, my life isn't a huge mess, it's just an average sized mess, and my grades are somewhere below average, but not to the point that I'll get straight Us for A levels (which is actually pretty impressive tbh) and the thing is for some odd reason I don't even care about As that much but I need it to obtain this vague thing called a ""future"". Years of not scoring well has immunized me from feeling sad over bad grades and das not gooood. 

It's not that I can't concentrate on anything, it's that I can't concentrate on the things I NEED to concentrate on, and if i try, I just end up thinking about weird shit. (Like if I read about extractive industries for geog, I end up thinking about how they mine gold, and gold is kinda pretty, though gold necklaces aren't so great but I would really like a gold ring though I don't necessarily want to get married but getting married would be neat wow can get BTO! And in the house you can have like a cat wait but hdb cannot have cat right okay then maybe condo but condo expensive sia so I'll just break the rules my neighbor got cat anyway and she's really cute and on and on) Ya that shit isn't fun especially when it happens during exams itself oh my GOD 

In the end I'm just left with this nagging feeling that I could be MORE than what I am right now, if I could just. Do. What I actually need to do. It's not a fun feeling, and my  teachers often say stuff like ""you're not living up to your full potential, what's happening?"" And I'm like uGGggghHH and so I just feel like a MASSIVE disappointment. 

People's expectations weighed so heavily on me that at some points in time I purposely didn't study at all so that I would flunk some papers, but sadly my teachers are really good people so they continue to try their best to boost my grades up. I have some pretty great teachers. 

The worst thing is the self-doubt, I think. Bc I don't actually know whether I have ADHD, plus I only realised like this year that its symptoms fit me perfectly. I really want a diagnosis, to just know for sure whether I have it or not, if I do then what do I do then? If I don't have it, then that's GREAT, I'm actually capable of functioning like a normal person. 

IN CONCLUSION, this has been a really long rant, and I focused this on exams and studying cos SGexams right, but it does impact the rest of my life, like I frequently accidentally tune out of conversations which annoys people, or how I would put myself into the path of bicycles bc I must.

I‚Äôve been seeing a fkton of depressing posts about a levels and it‚Äôs just extremely sad to see that a set of exams can cause so many people so much distress the system really sucks. But I‚Äôve been there too and hopefully this story will allay some fears!! (people who know me irl pls don‚Äôt dox or laugh at me for posting this HAHA my case is quite recognisable if you know me personally soooo)

in j2 I got diagnosed with major depression and anxiety - my mental health had been a ticking time bomb my whole life and a‚Äôs was just the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back basically lol. it affected me to the point I couldnt even attend school for a period of time. i was from marymount jc so in comparison to everyone else I‚Äôm pretty dumb (my grades are average/below average normally) and on top of that i was wayyyyy behind on content because I kept having to pon school for health reasons. i had mental and physical symptoms so studying was actually impossible for me at points. I considered dropping out for the rest of the year then coming back to repeat j2 the following year but jc was so stressful I was hell bent on spending the least possible time there so I ended up taking a‚Äôs last year.

it was a shitty year and I felt like shit for most of it - I don‚Äôt think I need to get into this whole sob story bc anyone who‚Äôs going through a‚Äôs would know how hard it can be. 

BUT HERE‚ÄôS THE MILDLY UPLIFTING PART - my prelim grades were a mix of D/E/Us with like 1 stray B for gp, in the weeks before a‚Äôs I didn‚Äôt know any content for history, hadn‚Äôt read like 2 books for literature, only studied half the poems we had to do. i did study as hard as i could and strategised and everything, but in the end i was at most 50% prepared for the papers. I went into a‚Äôs like this no kidding I‚Äôm really not exaggerating lol. for history I had so little to write I just took a nap after spewing any feeble content knowledge I had. Lit - I didn‚Äôt know shit beyond general overarching essay points for one whole essay but I still ended up pulling my straight Us in lit to an A. 

so look I didn‚Äôt die!!!!!!!! my a‚Äôs grades weren‚Äôt great (ABD/AC - 78ish rp) and I cried like shit when I got the results but they were way better than my prelims. and the key thing is they stopped mattering after literally 2 hours tops on results day. I was well above the cut off point for the uni course I wanted and that‚Äôs basically what your a‚Äôs cert is. just a ticket into uni and nothing more.

i know this doesn‚Äôt apply to everyone because a number of yall would be aiming for 90rp and scholarships and all but my point is that if I was this fucked and still pulled through, the majority of you are safe. please please don‚Äôt ever feel like you‚Äôre screwed because you didn‚Äôt finish an essay, or you made mistakes somewhere.

It made me feel less lonely and reassured in some way. I never really wanted to talk about this irl because it just sounded so stupid out loud or it isn't even a big deal to a lot of people.

Basically I'm getting more aware that I'm showing symptoms of...something? I don't know what because whenever I search about it, the info is so vague or related to other mental illnesses. It's either symptoms of bi-polar disorder, adhd or even ocd??Even now I'm rambling/stalling to get to what I'm trying to get across smfh- 

Since p6 my sense of time/urgency kinda deteriorated. I began doing homework later and later, sometimes not at all. Everytime I wake up 1 or 2 hours earlier to finish them I blame myself and hate how I keep repeating the same mistakes. I always think that I'd be better but no It's the same thing over and over again. I have months worth of overdue work up until this point since December. I can't believe how I even got away with it especially since I have my mtl o levels next week. I either procrastinate to the extreme or just zone out while I'm doing work. 

I can't concentrate one piece of work for more than 15-30 minutes. I have to move my attention to something else. That's why I have piles of incomplete work. My friends are aware of it too. They try to make me do one at a time but I just can't. I have this strong urge to *do something else*. Whether it's a different piece of homework or just mindlessly scrolling through my phone. 

Whenever I do work in class, my mind randomly gets fuzzy and forces me to zone out and stop what I'm doing. Most of the time it's just accumulated/suppressed negative feelings that just flood my head when I'm not even having a bad day. It really hinders my progress and at this rate I know I won't be able to do well for o lvls. The thoughts are just so loud, sometimes I scratch myself or spin my pen excessively just to take my mind off it but it isn't really effective. 

Since I'm so distracted, I'm getting more disorganized and misplacing my homework/notes everywhere. It makes me feel so embarrassed and jealous that my friends can do better than me. Even though they're just as messy, they still can have stuff done on their own. It's just not fair. I only get to complete my homework when I copy off my friends or the answers.  

A lot of small random things can just set me off sometimes and I don't even know what I'm upset about. Because of this I just think that I'm overreacting so it doesn't matter. But everytime, i get back to the same spot where I'm miserable and unmotivated to go to school. It's really hard for me to get up from bed most mornings so I have to wake up an hour earlier so I won't be late. 

I haven't shared this with anyone including the school counselor because I get sidetracked easily when I talk about it. I also kind of supress it to the point that I forget about it temporarily.
 ""It's no big deal, it will go away""
My parents think it's just the exam stress. But if it is then I wouldn't be having overwhelming thoughts to cut myself again or jump off the hdb just to escape a small problem. 

I just need to know where/how I can get help about what I'm going through because I just feel very lost and confused as to why I feel like this or do alot of things impulsively. I wanna get my shit straight before I take the o lvls for my other subjects, I think there's enough time.

1,MentalHealthSG,256,The line between abuse and discipline,gy7hy9,CaptBriyani,1591512373,3,1,"Inspired by another thread on this subreddit, I wonder what many think of the parenting style some Singaporean parents seem to adopt which uses abuse as a way in order to solve any sort of problems.

Growing up I had a single mother whose parenting methods were not ideal to say the least in ny eyes. She constantly took out all her anger and fustrations on me and my older brother. Didn't make a bed cause I had to rush for tution immediately after class and really didn't have time? I come home to see her slamming all the doors in anger? Failed a test? Instant barrage of slaps and silent treatment from her for atleast a week as well as threats to put me in boys home on my birthday if I didn't do well for PSLE. Couldn't do some questions on an assessment book? Instantly slapped a number of times well as a barrage of verbal abuse.  One time i was slapped and hit by my mom just because I didn't put curry( or as indians call it dhal) on my plate
Constantly telling a 12 year old boy that he was the reason that his mother developed cancer and looked so ugly. And many many more cases.
All her constant internal anger and hatred for everyone around her led to her developing colorectal cancer and passing away in 2014
My brother and I have speculated that my mother had some form of mental illnesses as she showed symptoms of borderline personality disorder as well as bipolar disorder but never sought help for it as she did not want to lose face.

It wasn't until a few years later that I realized that her behaviour was downright abusive and that it wasn't how parents are suppoused to treat their kids. Asian cultures seem to encourage using abusive behaviours as a form of discipline regardless of the effect it has on a child and I wonder what people think about it and where the line between abuse and discipline is drawn.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSG/comments/gy7hy9/the_line_between_abuse_and_discipline/,1.0,"[""I think there is a balance somewhere;\n\ne.g. for a hot pan and a parent is trying to stop and protect child\n\n1-guides the child to touch a safe part without burning hand, and inform child about safety (most ideal)\n\n2-allows the child to touch it and prepares to pull the child away if its too much (maybe ok for older kids aka learn the hard way)\n\n3-beats the hand lightly and say 'do not touch it' (safe but IMO child doesn't really learn anything)\n\nI think anything beyond these 3 is considered abuse?\n\nI think partly why Asian cultures do this is because they see the pain of discipline in academics is worth paying for as compared to the pain of failure later in life. While I agree with this notion, I see discipline as a value that is influenced and not 'beaten into'. \n\nI do observed the fear of being beaten or abuse may drive someone to some level of success, but surely there must be better ways of motivation. Maybe once or twice it somehow works; think O levels and PSLE, which actually serves as very bad examples to us, but maybe not parents POV. Especially if their focus is academic success 'at any cost'. \n\nOverall I still see this is not healthy in the long run and has a certain ceiling towards real success in life.""]"

However, we are to expect worse days ahead and even deaths to be reported. Yet I see long queues for food at many places, and also comments like ""It's just the flu"" which are meant to assure people and reduce panic.

While I do not agree with supermarket runs and other selfish behaviour, I think we do need to at least a little bit more concerned about Covid19. Here's why:

* It's not just the elderly and those with existing medical conditions who will be critically ill. Even the young and healthy (except perhaps little children) can have their immune systems go into overdrive and attack their organs.  [https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/here-is-what-coronavirus-does-to-the-body/](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/here-is-what-coronavirus-does-to-the-body/).
* Dr Richard Hatchett--Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations--wiho has 20 years of experience dealing with infectious diseases considers Covid19 to be more frightening than Ebola, MERS and Sars due to its infectiousness and much higher fatality rate than flu (compared to what was initially predicted). [https://youtu.be/dcJDpV-igjs](https://youtu.be/dcJDpV-igjs) 
* Even if local healthcare is capable of handling Covid19, it will not be able to do so if hospitals are overwhelmed by huge numbers of cases. This is what happened in Wuhan and is happening in Italy.  I find this report by a surgeon in Italy to be extremely compelling and moving: [https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ff8hns/testimony\_of\_a\_surgeon\_working\_in\_bergamo\_in\_the/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=ios\_app&amp;utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ff8hns/testimony_of_a_surgeon_working_in_bergamo_in_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

So can we all be at least a bit more concerned and continue to play our part in fighting this virus? We will not win the war by panicking and stockpiling; by blaming governments and countries, people of various races, etc. This is a global war! Be vigilant but stay calm. Stay home if you have even just some respiratory symptoms (and isolate from family members if need be) and see a doctor immediately if it worsens.

There is no panic among Singaporeans and the ""healthy shouldn't wear masks"" campaign had been so effective that now there is a major social stigma against wearing masks.  

Those wearing masks are ridiculed at schools, get criticized at work and get odd stares on public transport.  So what happens when people, especially the old and vulnerable, have mild symptoms?  They DO NOT WEAR masks because of the social stigma.  We can see this at clinics where patients are coughing/sneezing without masks.  We see this in public transport where people are coughing/sneezing without masks.  We see this in the SAFRA Jurong cluster where people with symptoms go about their work and social activities with no care and no masks.

The situation needs to be righted.  I believe our biggest problem in containing the virus spread in Singapore is getting those with symptoms to wear masks and avoid activities.  Some Ministers and officials can pretend to have symptoms and wear masks in public to show that it's OK to wear masks.

In this situation where it seems even people with very mild symptoms can cause a new cluster, we need to ensure that anybody who suspects they might be sick won't feel bad wearing a mask. So instead of looking at people wearing masks with accusing looks and calling them ""kiasi"" or irresponsible, we should instead be saying ""thanks for considering the health of those around you"". Because they might be sick and you just can't see it yet.

Of course the question is where are those masks going to come from? Well, the four masks per family were a month ago, so even if people are responsibly wearing them, you can expect many families will have used theirs up by now.

Unfortunately with the virus here to stay, and masks wasted unnecessarily -- noting that it is mathematically unrealistic to have enough for everyone over a prolonged period, we are starting to see sick people without masks (refer to recent anecdotes of sneezing/coughing openly in trains in daily threads) which is a very bad scenario as global infections start to skyrocket and spread over here.\n\nI think the govt planned ahead in the right manner by minimizing infections through rigorous contact tracing and being transparent about our current situation to build trust.

 ‚ÄùDon‚Äôt Pray Pray‚Äù...... Hope Your Children Speak Proper English!

I had a chance to listen to the condensed version of Chan Chun Sing‚Äôs recent closed-door dialogue.

The first thing I will advise is that all parents should stop their children from listening to it. It is a disgraceful glorification of Singlish, which has no place in a 1st World Country, where proper English should be taught and spoken. If our children were to speak like him in that audio, it would be the death-knell of the career prospects for many, unless you are an elite. Chan Chun Sing is really better suited to being Phua Chu Kang‚Äôs colleague if he chooses to speak in that manner!

Second, it was equally disgraceful that he chose to describe Singaporeans as ‚ÄúIdiots‚Äù, ‚ÄúSuckers‚Äù and ‚ÄúDisgraceful‚Äù. Many Singaporeans expressed their outrage to me about his remarks and I fully understand how they feel! From this incident, Chan Chun Sing shows himself to be cut from the same elitist cloth as his Party colleague Goh Chok Tong, who described those earning less than $500K as ‚Äúmediocre‚Äù.And this from a Party that professes to be - With You, For You, For Singapore!

Chan Chun Sing should know that many Singaporeans have lost confidence in how the government is handling the crisis. We now have the highest number of infections outside of China, despite being the furthest Asian country away, apart from Indonesia. Day after day our infections are increasing when other places such as Macau have not seen an increase in 11 days. That is what led to the recent panic-buying.

And is there anything unusual for people to want to get hold of masks? As far as I am aware, SINGAPORE is the only Asian country where the government advises its citizens not to use the mask, unless you are sick. The fact is that more and more people are now aware that wearing the mask is important to prevent the spread of the disease. Even the Hong Kong Society For Infectious Diseases has advised people to wear masks at all times in public areas, regardless of whether symptoms of Covid-19 is present. It is disgraceful that for weeks now, Singaporeans have not been able to purchase adequate masks for use.

It also uses a lot of manpower and I\'m really not sure if it is the best way"".\n\n&gt; Agreeing that there are infected people who present other symptoms before fever, Mr Gan said organisations that are doing the screening should also look out for people who do not appear to be well. ""If he doesn\'t look well, please advise him to go back and rest rather than rely solely on temperature taking.""\n\n&gt; He also appealed to people who are not feeling well to ""please see a doctor"", and if they remain sick a few days later, to please see the same doctor who would then have the person\'s history.\n\n&gt; Mr Gan fielded questions from about 10 MPs over the coronavirus outbreak, ranging from why general practitioners (GPs) cannot be given kits to test for the virus, to the risk posed by people returning from China.\n\n&gt; Mr Yee Chia Hsing (Chua Chu Kang GRC) pointed out that several confirmed cases had seen more than one doctor before being sent to hospital. Would it not be better if GPs were given testing kits so they can be sure, he asked.\n\n&gt; Mr Gan replied: ""Every day we have about 30,000 people down with flu-like symptoms like runny nose, cough and cold and so on. So it is not possible to test all 30,000 of them.""\n\n&gt; Furthermore, not all GPs may be familiar with the special techniques required to take the swabs for the test, and ""this can be quite a hazardous process"" that could expose the GP to unnecessary risk should the person have the virus.\n\n&gt; Such tests are better done at hospitals, which have trained personnel and facilities for this.\n\n&gt; Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far\n\n&gt; This is also why the multi-ministry task force has recommended that people with such symptoms be given five days of medical leave - most people with the normal cold, for example, would recover in that time, said Mr Gan.\n\n&gt; But those who do not need not panic since there are some illnesses that take longer.\n\n&gt; This is why they should return to the same doctor, who can then make a clinical judgment on whether the person may have the coronavirus.\n\n&gt; He asked employers to allow staff who have been given five days of MC to stay away from work.\n\n&gt; ""And if the doctor gives you an MC, stay at home throughout the MC period. Don\'t go around and don\'t go and queue up to buy toilet paper and so on,"" he said, referring to the panic buying that occurred when Singapore raised the risk assessment of the coronavirus outbreak to code orange, the second-highest level.\n\n&gt; ""Please stay at home and if you need help, always there\'s an MOH hotline that you can call if you need some help. And if you are very ill and you need the ambulance, you can always call for an ambulance and we will convey you to the hospital.""\n\n&gt; As to the risk posed by people returning from China, who will be served 14-day stay-home notices - a measure that kicks in on Feb 18 midnight - Mr Gan emphasised that these are not people who have the coronavirus infection, nor are they close contacts of people who have the virus.\n\n&gt; They are told to stay home for 14 days as they had been exposed to a community that carries that risk. This is to minimise any risk of spread from them, said Mr Gan.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

 Case 44 is a 37 year-old male Singapore Citizen with no recent travel history to China.

He went to KTPH on 6 February where he was immediately isolated. Subsequent test results confirmed 2019-nCoV infection on 9 February afternoon.Prior to hospital admission, he had gone to work at Certis Cisco Centre (20 Jalan Afifi), and had been on duty at Chingay 2020. Prior to onset of symptoms, he had served Quarantine Orders on two individuals from Wuhan who were subsequently tested positive for 2019-nCoV. He had not served any Quarantine Order after onset of symptoms. He stays at Sembawang Drive.

I have a few hard questions today about CISCO and MOH‚Äôs handling of nCOV case 44

1. What biosafety measures and instructions are CISCO staff taking before, during and after serving the quarantine orders?
2. What kind of interaction did the CISCO officer have with the 2 patients?
3. Why was the CISCO officer not put in quarantine from their families or on restricted duties after working with potentially infected patients?
4. Whose idea at CISCO was it to place a person who was in relatively close contact - explaining the quarantine order - and then staffing one of the biggest public events?
5. Where areas and locations was the officer positioned while on duty at Chingay?
6. Should members of the public have contracted the nCov at Chingay, what measures are available to compensate them? Save for CISCO knowingly or negligently placing on duty a staff with exposure to nCOV at a large community event, thousands of members of the public would not have been exposed to this.
7. How many other CISCO officers are in similar circumstances of having served quarantine orders and then performed duties in crowds? What has been done to monitor or quarantine them?
8. Are there any other people served with quarantine orders that may have been infected by such CISCO officers?
9. What steps are CISCO amd MOH taking to prevent a repeat of this incident?

So here in this sub and in general all across social media there're a lot of condemnation pointed towards people who are hoarding/stockpiling. We see pictures of people selling mask at higher prices, aiming to get a profit out of this, and we see empty shelves in supermarket due to panic buying and hoarding of food items and for some reason tissue papers.

But why is stockpiling NOW bad? Assuming people are stockpiling 'just enough'. The virus seems to spreading fast and without any symptoms. Currently there are 40 confirmed cases. Considering the population density and Singapore, I think it might just get worse and worse. If the situation become worse, then going out shopping in upcoming weeks will will put people at higher risk right?

When that happens, those most at risk are the people close to us, such as family members, colleagues and close friends,"" said Professor Leo.\n\n&gt; She called on people to protect themselves, those around them and the community by being socially responsible.\n\n&gt; This means remaining at home, not paying visits to others and avoiding older family members, who are most at risk of complications from the disease.\n\n&gt; While it was previously unclear if asymptomatic spread is an issue, this has changed as scientists learn more about the virus. Newer findings now suggest that those who do not display symptoms of the disease could be spreading it widely without knowing it.\n\n&gt; Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases expert who practises at Rophi Clinic at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said that studies done in the United States, China and Italy show that more than half to about 70 per cent of those with Covid-19 are either asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms, but they can shed the virus for up to four weeks.\n\n&gt; He said this could mean that circuit breakers may have to be in force beyond May 4 to really stem disease transmission as these individuals would need about six weeks (an incubation period of up to 14 days plus four weeks) to stop being infectious.\n\n&gt; Related Story Coronavirus: Rising number of local unlinked cases in past 14 days\n\n&gt; Related Story Coronavirus: New study finds at least 10 patients in Singapore caught virus from those without symptoms\n\n&gt; Dr Leong also said the number of asymptomatic persons with Covid-19 here would add to herd immunity, but there had to be a large enough infected population for herd immunity to be acquired.\n\n&gt; ""At this rate, it could take at least two to three years for that to happen,"" he said.\n\n&gt; People should instead adhere to the strict circuit breaker measures in place to curtail such potentially widespread community transmissions.\n\n&gt; Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, programme leader of the infectious diseases programme at the National University of Singapore\'s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said people who do not show symptoms throughout their infection would escape detection.\n\n&gt; However, it is known that a significant proportion of such asymptomatic infections exists because of the extensive testing done on cruise ships such as the Diamond Princess and in countries such as Iceland, South Korea and Germany, and when work and family clusters are investigated, including in China.\n\n&gt; ""We know from work by MOH (Ministry of Health) that pre-symptomatic transmission of the virus can occur, and this is possibly also true from asymptomatic cases,"" said Prof Hsu.\n\n&gt; There have now been almost 3,000 cases of Covid-19 here.\n\n&gt; An article in the medical journal BMJ noted that around four in five coronavirus infections in China cause no illness.\n\n&gt; Related Story China sees rises in new coronavirus cases, asymptomatic patients\n\n&gt; Related Story Chinese experts express concerns over rise in asymptomatic coronavirus carriers\n\n&gt; On April 1, China began publishing daily figures on the number of new asymptomatic coronavirus cases. Its National Health Commission reported that about 78 per cent, or 130, of 166 new infections identified in the 24 hours to the afternoon of April 1 were asymptomatic.\n\n&gt; The top US infectious diseases expert, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci, also noted about a week ago that rough estimates indicate that about 25 per cent to 50 per cent of those with Covid-19 may not show any symptoms. It is also why masks or face coverings are now advised so that people can use them to block the droplets that escape from their mouths when they talk or exhale.\n\n&gt; What is also now clear about the disease is that it is highly infectious at the start, when a person has yet to show symptoms or is showing very mild symptoms. This means he can make others very sick when he is only mildly ill.\n\n&gt; This is contrary to common sense thinking to stay away from others only when someone is very sick, and is one of the reasons the authorities have called for the public to stay home.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

34,singapore,227366,Consequences of not fully declaring medical conditions to uni?,fxz3vh,cather04,1586461167,17,1,"I'm enrolling in a local University this year and I understand that I'll have to do a health screening including a self-declaration.

During junior college, I was seriously depressed and got the balls to seek help from IMH. When medications did not seem to work out, I was given a blood test, found that I had an underactive thyroid at that time which contributes to depression-like symptoms and I was treated for underactive thyroid at a polyclinic. (Though not exactly simple, my depression history can be traced back into upper sec.)

Now all's good; I no longer take any thyroid hormone replacements from polyclinic, and my medicine from IMH side is being reduced. I have been depression-free for over a year. However, I still have forthcoming appointments on both sides for check-up and these are unlikely to stop before uni health screening. While I'll likely eventually go off medication if status quo is maintained, it can't happen before this soon.

**The thing is, I do not want the University to be privy to any of this information, regardless of whether I actually have the condition.** I am a very high functioning individual (applying to competitive courses, with straight As for my A levels.) Never have I requested special arrangements for exams, so no special marking on my A level certificate. I simply don't think they know what's best for me, and I'm very tired of being stereotyped and demeaned based on my mental health history. (A dentist once asked me if I could take the ""stress"" of braces treatment when I told him my existing medications!) My parents are of the opinion that I should not tick ""yes"" for the relevant questions on the declaration form, and agree to fund all expenses separate from the university should any issues arise in future.

Well my first concern is: will the University find out? Like, will the health screening doctor access NEHR for my records? What about in future when I see a University doctor (if I go NUS they have the UHC), who will see my NEHR information when updating it, and realise I have had a shit tonne of blood tests done in IMH and polyclinic, with ongoing appointments?

My second concern is: what would happen should they find out? **Will I be expelled?** Coz I'm fine if they don't cover me for subsidy for existing conditions. I'm fine with anything. As long as I'm not going to be expelled.

In a way, I really really want to live like this never happened. I'm really, really fine now, anyway.

36,singapore,227201,[Long] Looking at numbers and case studies - Was a lockdown necessary?,fxmiwo,yingyn,1586409847,38,0,"The soft lockdown ""Circuit Breaker"" has affected all our lives - most businesses are shut, families and loved ones may not be able to see each other, and simple activities we used to take for granted can no longer be carried out. A lot of my friends seem to think that this action was made out of necessity, and I was unsure if that was the case. More jobs will be lost as a result, and the economic contraction more severe. I think this question comes in 2 parts. First, is the CB necessary, given the state we were in a few days earlier. Second, could a different strategy been used to avoid the state we were in a few days earlier. So, in my lunchtime WFH, i decided to look at some case studies and numbers.

**Looking around us in Asia for examples**
A lot of people within this sub seems to compare us to Malaysia, or to the US/UK. But as well all know, these countries are vastly different - the presence of soft and hard infrastructure for one. For example, its difficult for the US to ramp up testing to be able to keep up with their testing needs given their large population. So let us look at the countries/regions that the world usually compares Singapore with - Hong Kong, Taiwan and sometimes South Korea (collectively, the 4 of us SG included are considered to be the Asian tigers)

**Hong Kong**
HK policies for now seem to be in a state similar to how we were pre-CB. From SCMP *""Hong Kong has since late March banned public gatherings of more than four people, while cinemas, fitness centres, bars, pubs and other leisure venues have been ordered to close for two weeks. Restaurants also have to keep tables 1.5 metres apart.""* Note that there are some discussions if a lockdown (i.e. closing of non-essential businesses) is necessary. To date, HK has 961 cases, 4 deaths out of a population of 7.4m.

**Taiwan**
Taiwan seems to be the greatest example of a successful coronavirus response. From Japantimes *""Yet nearly 100 days in, Taiwan has just 376 confirmed cases and five fatalities while restaurants, bars, schools, universities and offices remain open.** 376 cases, 5 deaths off a population of 24m. No lock down of any kind

**South Korea**
Any case study cited globally as a success story - despite an early spread, SK managed to curb local transmissions without locking down or closing essential businesses. While they have a total of 10.4k cases and 204 deaths off a population of 51m population, their recent daily case count has been hovering around 50 for the past 3-4days.

**So why and how was this managed?**
**Because Singaporeans don't listen? Not really**
This was the part which really got me scratching my head. 
Initially, I thought that it might have been something often cited by Reddit - that Singaporeans have been out and about too much, becoming complacent due to our early success. **The numbers say otherwise**. Google is now publishing a mobility report to help Governments better tackle the virus, and the most recent report as of 29 Mar shows that our mobility is in line with these other countries. In fact, our Retail and Recreation mobility has dropped by 28% - higher than the 19% and 9% fall of SK and Taiwan respectively. Only HK's fall is higher - 35%. There are a number of statistics here as well, I won't go into each of them, but generally it seems that comparatively, we have reduced our activity as much as if not more than other countries 

**Because the government didn't shut down public transport? Not really either**
There's a lot of criticisms about the government's action not to restrict public transport, with detractors saying that even transient contact may be dangerous. Again, the numbers show that this may not be the case. Mobility through transit stations in Singapore is i more than the 3 other countries. SG saw a fall of 40%, as compared to -45%, -24% and -17% in HK, SK and TW respectively. If transit is to blame, these countries should have seen a similar surge.

**Because schools are open? Maybe, though probably not**
There has been quite some debate about whether schools should stay open as well. There aren't any hard data points I could find about this, but Taiwan has managed to keep cases low while keeping schools open. That, plus the fact that few of our clusters are schools and the school clusters primarily involve adults, prove that this may not be the case. I.e. the schools are just as likely to be hit as any other workplace. But since I lack any hard data to prove this (maybe the kids are asymptomatic and spreading it around, some may say), I will refrain from comment.

**My hypothesis - lack of aggressive testing**
Well, this is purely my opinion, and one which I welcome criticisms / evidence that suggest otherwise. I came across a reddit post 1-2days earlier that said that Singapore doesn't test all flu like symptoms on the first day of having coughs, but only if it persists or the individual shows pneumonia-like symptoms. Furthermore, SK, TW and (as far as news reports seem to insinuate), HK, all allow for voluntary testing - i.e. anyone can get tested, but they will cover the cost of tests themselves for $20-$60 depending. I've since confirmed this with friends who have recently visited doctors for minor coughs, but please tell me I'm wrong if otherwise. If true, this may be reason why community spread got out of hand as quickly as it did. Both WHO and doctors who fought at the epicentre in Wuhan have spoken about the need for rigorous and extensive testing throughout the community to stem the spread.

**And hence my final point and conclusion**
I think the government has done well, in general, but has put in place a little too lax of a testing regime. Extensive contact tracing, effective to curb spreads where we know exactly where potential patients are coming from (e.g. China) worked wonders for us, but seems to work less well in a time where the virus is spreading rampantly within the community.

Do I think that the government should have held off on the CB? Yes - I think they should have instead put forth an aggressive testing regime like in SK and TW. Could I possibly be wrong? Yes. It's very possible or even likely that the government had access to more data than I to conclude that the situation was getting out of hand to the extent that nothing but a CB would work. Cases in SK, TW and HK (which is likely, as noted earlier) could surge, prolonging the damage. But I also think that we need to, as a populace, be conscious of the fact that there are always alternatives and potentially better solutions, and there needs to be discourse on what the best course of action is. Both during the pandemic, for alternative solutions, and after the pandemic, for accountability and future learning.

43,singapore,225265,"Would the correct initial response to Covid have been to initiate a full border closure immediately, rather than delay?",ftcw4p,BEaSTGiN,1585789910,20,1,"I think that although there was a delay between the time China released news of the virus and the time the outbreak occured (thus no way to have stopped the first batch of tourists/returnees from Wuhan from entering SG), we could have stopped the vast majority of cases from entering Singapore by closing our borders to at least all flights from China, on the first week we received notice of the virus.

So some of you may say, that is an unreasonable course of action at the time because it was not announced as a pandemic yet, etc. so to close our borders immediately on the premise of a possibly contained virus is uncalled for. But I think that any kind of easily contact spread virus = grounds for at least immediate border closure to all flights originating from the country of the epidemic. We did not do this for MERS-CoV because MERS is difficult to transmit from person to person even with close contact, so the chances of it become a pandemic is low. But all viruses that are easily contact spread from person to person such as Covid have high potential to become pandemics. It is a cause to raise the alarm immediately. This is especially the case for Singapore because the majority of our tourists come from China and we get large numbers of Chinese tourists every day (before Covid) and therefore we are one of the most at risk communities. 

Now that we only made the decision to totally close borders two weeks ago, we take on an unnecessary increase in casualties and economic damage. Since the end outcome was total border closure anyway, the net loss for the country = present and future costs incurred due to additional influx of cases - revenue earned from keeping borders open for a few more weeks. If I do very simplistic calculations based on tourism and investment gains from 2018, the immediate loss incurred from a border closure on day 1 of receiving notice, is about 3 billion's worth in 3 weeks - far less than the 40+ billion we are setting aside for current and future measures.

Of course, there would be some more cases after border closure due to people getting infected with the first wave of tourists/returnees but not manifesting symptoms until 2 weeks later (hence possibly spreading it during this time). But I think it would be far less than the amount we currently have due to keeping borders open for another few weeks before closure, letting more infected people enter and spreading the disease. 

My opinion is that the initial low number of cases (80-100) and the slow rate of increase (several to ten a day) made us complacent of the situation, that we overlooked the possibility that it was the calm before the storm and that there were many potential cases still brewing in our midst (now showing symptoms). So now we have the second wave, which is all the people who came in before and during those few weeks when the borders were still open/ those that interacted with them.

44,singapore,225191,"Was closing our borders immediately the correct response to Covid, rather than delaying?",fsyxjm,BEaSTGiN,1585744468,1,1,"I think that although there was a delay between the time China released news of the virus and the time the outbreak occured (thus no way to have stopped the first batch of tourists/returnees from Wuhan from entering SG), we could have stopped the vast majority of cases from entering Singapore by closing our borders to at least all flights originating from Wuhan or perhaps all of China, on the first week we received notice of the virus.

So some of you may say,  that is an unreasonable course of action at the time because it was not announced as a pandemic yet, etc. so to close our borders immediately on the premise of a possibly contained virus is uncalled for. But I think that any kind of easily contact spread virus = grounds for at least immediate border closure to all flights originating from the country of the epidemic. We did not do this for MERS-CoV because MERS is difficult to transmit from person to person even with close contact, so the chances of it become a pandemic is low. But all viruses that are easily contact spread from person to person such as Covid have high potential to become pandemics. It is a cause to raise the alarm immediately. This is especially the case for Singapore because the majority of our tourists come from China and we get large numbers of Chinese tourists every day (before Covid) and therefore we are one of the most at risk communities. 

Now that we only made the decision to close borders two weeks ago, we take on an unnecessary increase in casualties and economic damage. Since the end outcome was total border closure anyway, the net loss for the country = present and future costs incurred due to additional influx of cases - revenue earned from keeping borders open for a few more weeks. If I do very simplistic calculations based on tourism and investment gains from 2018, the immediate loss incurred from a border closure on day 1 of receiving notice, is about 3 billion's worth in 3 weeks - far less than the 40+ billion we are setting aside for current and future measures.

Of course, there would be some more cases after border closure due to people getting infected with the first wave of tourists/returnees but not manifesting symptoms until 2 weeks later (hence possibly spreading it during this time). But I think it would be far less than the amount we currently have due to keeping borders open for another few weeks before closure, letting more infected people enter and spreading the disease. 

My opinion is that the initial low number of cases (80-100) and the slow rate of increase (several to ten a day) made us complacent of the situation, that we overlooked the possibility that it was the calm before the storm and that there were many potential cases still brewing in our midst (now showing symptoms).

Once it has been proven that it cannot spread asymptomatic, only then can we relax on our measures.\n\n- Do not solely rely on temperature screening.

We learnt the hard way when Taiwan stopped the export of masks from our factories.\n\n- In addition to the previous point, we should diversity our imports and their supply chain. I think we did pretty well on this but the majority of the supply chain is in China.

On my social media, I still see many of my friends flouting this (and mocking this) in public places (&gt;10 people and no distancing). 

Normally I‚Äôm not that anal about wanting to whistle-blow, but some of them are people who returned from Europe and ASEAN countries right before the SHN and border bans kick in. So they returned in early March from Europe/ Australia/ Vietnam/ returned from KL and JB by car a day before the lockdown. They narrowly avoided our SHN regulations. (PS they are different groups of people in my different classes).

To make matters worse, some of them had a fever and were coughing but didn‚Äôt seek medical advice because they‚Äôre foreign students. They‚Äôre now complaining on social media about our draconian and unconstitutional laws (the new IDA regulations) and don‚Äôt seem to take this seriously. Our university gave out thermometers in late Jan/ early Feb but some of them didn‚Äôt collect it until late March when the school passed very strict sanctions on violation of temperature screening rules in school. The same people from the latter group almost didn‚Äôt declare their temperatures beforehand because they posted their temperature taking attendance rate (1-3%) online with an ‚Äúoops‚Äù caption.

Now I see their social media and I‚Äôm concerned. I went to PHPC a few days ago to get my respiratory symptoms checked (no fever).

The taxi driver you sit in an enclosed space with, the commuters you come in contact with on public transports, the people working in an enclosed space with you, they're gonna be suffering too.


Have you ever thought about you overloading the hospitals? That people who needs it more can't be treated because of you being selfish? Have you read up on the situation in other countries? There are countries with insufficient test kits and people are infecting more people without even realising it. There's an incubation period of 2 weeks where there's no symptoms shown and you could very well be spreading it. There isn't a cure for it right now, the doctors won't be able to save those who are in critical condition. They are going to see a patient slowly deteriorate knowing they can't do anything about it. 


Those who work have no choice but those who don't, please stay home. People are worried about the economy falling but if the situation continues to worsen, shops would have to be closed, companies would be forced to layoff employees, people would lose their jobs, people would no longer have income to support their families, mass recessions.

So much so, that in Singapore I've been seeing two sides of the coin on a daily basis. I've seen people who rush at the earliest indication of a worsening situation to buy an unnecessary amount of groceries and provisions. I've seen people sharing every bit of information they can access about the pandemic to their families and friends, regardless of its accuracy or credibility. I've seen people also sharing posts and videos, that not only contain no factual information, but that are designed to fear monger those who watch it. 

However, I've also seen large gatherings of students in public places after school. I've seen people who are sick, and travel on public transport without a face mask. I've overheard people talking about other countries, and how their situation is markedly worse than Singapore's ""as their country doesn't manage these things well"" or ""because their government doesn't know how to handle"". 

Both what Dr. Balakrishnan and PM Lee said during their CNBC interview and National Address, respectively, should resonate strongly with us as a nation. 

As Singaporean citizens, PRs, or residents, we are extremely fortunate that our government, healthcare services, and workers who are dealing with the pandemic, have been able to guide us in handling the COVID-19 situation in the best way possible. 

Whilst we are currently being held in high regard for our country's management of this outbreak since it began at the tail-end of 2019, we cannot let this be a reason for us to become complacent. We have been able to effectively approach COVID-19 due not only to our infrastructure, but also to our actions as individuals. 

Our government's advisory has lead us on the best path so far to combating the severity of this pandemic, and whilst we should be confident in their abilities to guide us going forward, we must always remember that each of us contributes to combating this virus effectively. It is up to us to play our part and work together with each other to continue Singapore's effective management of COVID-19.

Whatever demographic you may be, take care of your personal hygiene, and be respectful of it to those around you. Practice social distancing, even if you are young and are feeling well, because even if you carry COVID-19 but do not show any symptoms, by going out to public common spaces, you could transmit to someone who is much more susceptible to the virus than you are. Always check news sources to ensure information is factual and correct. Do not share media if it does not come from a credible source.

We have been able to set an example to the world on how to combat this virus, so let us all continue to work together to keep ourselves safe, well informed, and prepared for whatever may come by taking a rational and sensible approach to new information as it becomes available to us.

Overnight in Asia, we hosted a call with Professor John Nicholls, a clinical professor in pathology at The University of Hong Kong and expert on coronaviruses. He was a key member of the research team at The University of Hong Kong which isolated and characterized the novel SARS coronavirus in 2003. He has been studying coronaviruses for 25 years. Below are my notes transcribing the call. 

Quick summary: 

Look at the fatality rate outside of Wuhan - it‚Äôs below 1%. The correct comparison is not SARS or MERS but a bad cold which kills people who already have other health issues. This virus will burn itself out in May when temperatures rise. Wash your hands.
 
My notes from the call below:
 
Q&amp;A Session with Professor Nicholls:
 
What is the actual scale of the outbreak? How much larger is it compared to the official ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù cases?
 
People are saying a 2.2 to 2.4% fatality rate total. However recent information is very worthy - if you look at the cases outside of China the mortality rate is &lt;1%. [Only 2 fatalities outside of mainland China]. Two potential reasons: 1) either China‚Äôs healthcare isn‚Äôt as good ‚Äì that‚Äôs probably not the case, 2) What is probably right is that just as with SARS there‚Äôs probably much stricter guidelines in mainland China for a case to be considered positive. So the 20,000 cases in China is probably only the severe cases; the folks that actually went to the hospital and got tested. The Chinese healthcare system is very overwhelmed with all the tests going through. So my thinking is this is actually not as severe a disease as is being suggested. The fatality rate is probably only 0.8%-1%. There‚Äôs a vast underreporting of cases in China. Compared to SARS and MERS we are talking about a coronavirus that has a mortality rate of 8 to 10 times less deadly to SARS to MERS. So a correct comparison is not SARS or MERS but a severe cold. Basically, this is a severe form of the cold.
 
You mentioned a shortage of testing kit can you talk more about that?
 
There are two ways to detect a virus: 1) Through the genetic material ‚Äì DNA or RNA or, 2) to detect the protein of the virus. The rapid tests used in a doctors‚Äô labs look at the protein. The problem with that is that you need an antibody to pick it up. And it takes 8-12 weeks to make commercial antibodies. So right now for the diagnostics tests they are using PCR which give you a turnaround in 1-2 hours. But then you need to run a machine and run 96 runs in 1 hour but then you have to a batch of samples so there‚Äôs another delay of 5-6 hours for patient presentation. So that will lead to some problems you can‚Äôt turnaround in 5-10 mins which is what you want when a patient shows up to the emergency room. Because right now you also have influenza going around so what you want is to be able to rule out influenza so you can treat the patients correctly for coronavirus. So that may be why they missed some of the earlier cases.
 
Your colleague at HKU estimated that the size of the infected population on Jan 25th was 75K with a doubling time of 6.4 days. So by Feb first we would have 150k infected. How accurate do you think these models are and how accurate have they been in the past?
 
Those figures did not take into account restriction on travel, quarantine etc. These reports are likely on the high side. This is not taking into account social distancing. Historically, these models have not been all that accurate.
 
When do you think this thing will peak?

Three things the virus does not like: 1) sunlight, 2) temperature, and 3) humidity. To make you guys really worried. A coronavirus can survive on a stainless steel surface for 36 hours. It hangs around for quite a bit.
 
Sunlight will cut the virus ability to grow in half so the half-life will be 2.5 mins and in the dark it‚Äôs about 13 mins to 20 mins. Sunlight is really good at killing viruses. That‚Äôs why I believe that Australia and the southern hemisphere will not see any great infections rates because they have lots of sunlight and they are in the middle of summer. And Wuhan and Beijing is still cold which is why there is high infection rates.
 
In regards to temperature, the virus can remain intact at 4 degrees or 10 degrees for a longer period of time. But at 30 degrees then you get inactivation. And high humidity the virus doesn‚Äôt like it either. That is why I think SARS stopped around May and June in 2003 ‚Äì that‚Äôs when there‚Äôs more sunlight and more humidity. The environment is a crucial factor. The environment will be unfavourable for growth around May. The evidence is to look at the common cold ‚Äì it‚Äôs always during winter. So the natural environment will not be favourable in Asia in about May.
 
The second factor is that of personal contact. With SARS once it was discovered that the virus was spread through the fecal oral route, there was much less emphasis on the masks, and far more emphasis on disinfection and washing hands. HK has far more cleanliness (than China) and they are very aware of social hygiene. And other countries will be more aware of the social hygiene (than China). So in those countries you should see less outbreaks and spreading. A couple days ago the fecal-oral route of transmission was confirmed in Shenzhen. In China, most of the latrines are open-  there‚Äôs more chance of phermites (?) being spread. But in other countries the sanitations systems tends to closed. My personal view is that this will be a bad cold and it will all be over by May.
 
People talk about the vaccine and this is the big problem that people get from movies. Where in the movie they come out with a vaccine and then three days later it‚Äôs all over the world and everybody is saved. In reality this does not happen because for a vaccine you need to go through clinical trials ‚Äì is it safe and will it work. The last thing you want to do is rush a vaccine too early. If you get any severe reactions, then the anti-vaxxer will just say ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù. You are talking about a working vaccine in 1 to 2 years. With SARS, in 6 months the virus was all gone and it pretty much never came back. SARS pretty much found a sweet spot of the perfect environment to develop and hasn‚Äôt come back. So no pharmaceutical company will spend millions and millions to develop a vaccine for something which may never come back. It is Hollywood to think that vaccines will save the world. The social conditions are what will control the virus ‚Äì the cleaning of hands, isolating sick people etc‚Ä¶
 
What do we know about the transmission rate? It‚Äôs been estimated around 2.2 to 2.68. What percent of the patients are transmitting while being asymptomatic?
 
This is a big problem when you talk about asymptomatic that means you have a good diagnostic test- where you can say they are asymptomatic (which we don‚Äôt have with this virus).
 
We actually looked at this with MERS where people were saying it had a high fatality. We went to camel abattoirs and took serums from the abattoir workers and found that quite a few had low infections with no symptoms. This is what should have been done at the initial stages at the seafood market. But to do that you need a good diagnostic test. A good diagnostic test is necessary to determine to the transmission rate. Now we have normal human airways and we can now look at how long it takes the virus to replicate in that environment. And that will be very useful to determine those who are asymptomatic carriers.
 
Any sense of whether the estimates of the reproductive number the R0 of 2.5 or 2.7.  Do you think that is high or low. What does that mean?
 
Measles was about 10-15 and influenza is just below 2. I think it‚Äôs about 2.2 as it‚Äôs being transmitted within the community.
 
Have we seen any super spreaders? We saw that with SARS and MERS.
 
There‚Äôs talk about that but the epidemiologists are still overwhelmed so no clear answer. But I don‚Äôt think there are any super spreaders.
 
What is the percentage of people transmitting the virus while being asymptomatic?
 
Unlike SARS, patients were symptomatic at about day 5, some of these cases may be asymptomatic until about day 7. That‚Äôs based on the first publications. Asymptomatic is probably the first 5 days.
 
There‚Äôs a paper published looking a familial cluster with a boy who was shredding the virus and he was asymptomatic.
 
That‚Äôs something about kids and we saw this with SARS. Very few kids had very severe disease. We are trying to determine if this is a virus which we call low (unintelligible) kind of inducer or high (unintelligible) kind of inducer.  SARS is high [unintelligible] kind of inducer. This means that when it infects the lower part of the lung, the body develops a very severe reaction against it and leads to lots of inflation and scarring. In SARS what we found is that after the first 10 to 15 days it wasn‚Äôt the virus killing the patients it was the body‚Äôs reaction.
 
We are doing testing on this now. Is this virus in the MERS or SARS kind picture or is this the other type of virus which is a milder coronavirus like the NL63 or the 229. I think this will be a mild (unintelligible) kind inducer.
 
Case fatality is about 2.5% or so? Do you expect this to change over time? And are you seeing any difference among the young population and older population in terms or mortality rate?

SARS went really for people in their 30 or 50 years. And MERS on the other hand basically is if you have co-morbidity ‚Äì try and find somebody in the middle east who does not smoke or does not have high blood pressure etc.. The data coming out of China seems to indicate that it‚Äôs those with the co-morbidity are most at risk. For the seasonal influenza that‚Äôs also what we find. It‚Äôs the people with the co-morbidity that have the increase mortality rate.  Having said that there‚Äôs a guy in the Philippines who died in his mid-30.
 
I think this looks more like the seasonal influenza where those who die have to co-morbidity.  Now that we have better case control definitions outside of mainland China, we will get a true assessment of the fatality rate. I would now put it at about 0.8% to 1%.  When you look at all the death reports ‚Äì separate out the deaths from mainland China and outside China.
 
Mortality rate in China ‚Äì is much higher? Why?
 
Its related to the environment. In the high income countries you don‚Äôt have as high a population density, higher level of environment control and hygiene. In Indonesia ‚Äì it‚Äôs unlikely to spread much as it‚Äôs very hot and humid. Would this virus move to Africa? I think that‚Äôs unlikely ‚Äì too hot there‚Äôs not a lot of travel there. Europe ‚Äì possibility higher transmission but environmental care is higher.
 
At this stage it‚Äôs a really bad cold which can cause problems in people. People are talking about the ‚Äúlethal virus‚Äù but seasonal influenza can cause deaths in elderly but we don‚Äôt call that ‚Äúthe lethal influenza‚Äù.
 
There‚Äôs news reports that antivirals are being used and that it‚Äôs working what are your thoughts on that?
 
With SARS it didn‚Äôt seem to work at all with the commercially available antivirals. But there seems to be good effects with the case in Washington with the Gilead agent. And it sounds like China will be using it.
 
Interferon works and it has quite a bit of benefit.
 
The problem with the antivirals ‚Äì because the virus has different ways of replicating within the cell, finding a nice common target has been difficult. But the Gilead agent appears to me to be very promising. We now have the virus growing in our labs/cultures so can now test it to see what will work and not work.
 
Would the opening of the hospitals in China change anything?
What we found with SARS in HK was that a contributing factor to the spread was the overwhelming of the HK healthcare system. Hospitals and doctors were overwhelmed. When China built these Wuhan hospitals ‚Äì it‚Äôs to take the work load off the staff which is likely exhausted.  
 
In HK with SARS we found quite a lot of infection of healthcare workers as they are close and doing invasive procedures. But this time around there is not much evidence of the healthcare workers getting sick or dying (but maybe China is not reporting it) so this may suggest that I think it is not being spread by close aerosol contact but more by the fecal-oral route or with droplets. So it will not be as contagious within hospitals. So getting the two hospitals built it will take a lot of the work load off the other hospitals so it should be a big benefit.
 
The recovery rate now higher than the deaths rate? Thoughts on that?
What we found is that in HK with SARS we didn‚Äôt know how long to treat a patient for. Now in China they are using the SARS model but treating patients for shorter time periods so that they don‚Äôt get the secondary problems that they did with Sars. Getting actual data on recovery from the mainland is still a bit of a challenge.
 
I‚Äôd consider a patient recovered if he‚Äôs been discharged. The problem is that with SARS, there were quite a bit of people where the steroid were very beneficial to treat the acute stage and we didn‚Äôt know how long the virus would live for so we kept them on the steroids for a long period of time and they came out with all sorts of secondary problems due to the immunosuppression.
 
I haven‚Äôt seen any data on the quality of life of those who have been discharged.
 
Evidence of E-coli?
Secondary infection are most likely the cause of deaths of the patients in the Philippines and HK.
 
What does it mean for a patient to have recovered?
That means the patient has been discharged from the hospital. That‚Äôs the criteria for Hong Kong. But there‚Äôs no good data or guidelines on this.
 
What is the probability that this will be contained and eradicated or will it be endemic in the human population?
If it is like SARS it will not be endemic. It most likely will be a hit and run just like SARS. People talk about mutation but what we found with SARS was that there was no mutation and we have been tracking MERS and we have not seen any severe mutation. This is unlike the common coronavirus which when they replicate they don‚Äôt have a ‚Äùspell check‚Äù so they mutate. So if this virus follows the same path as SARS or MERS it won‚Äôt mutate.  This will not be endemic. I think it will burn itself out in about 6 months.
 
Does mortality rate or fatality rate typically increase over time? That was apparently the case with SARS. 
With SARS we didn‚Äôt know how long the virus was alive for. So with SARS in the later stages people were not dying of SARS but of the complications of SARS which is why the mortality rate increased. But now people are much more aware of the dangers of over immunosuppression. So the death rate shouldn‚Äôt be more severe. Especially with the new hospitals being established which should take some of the workload off of the healthcare workers from Wuhan.
 
If we look at the serious cases being reported it‚Äôs about 13% of the total cases being reported. If we assume a 50% mortality rate for the severe cases than we are looking at a mortality rate of 5-6%. Is that a fair assumption?

In Hubei, the milder cases are not making it to the hospital. Because they are so overwhelmed that milder cases are being sent away. So that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important not to look at the mortality rate in Wuhan but to look at the mortality rate in Shanghai or Shenzhen or outside of Wuhan. It‚Äôs very important to dissect it out.
 
Would it be too early to make conclusion outside of Wuhan? It‚Äôs still really early days outside of Wuhan? Are we making assumption with very little data and very early data?

That‚Äôs all the data we have to work with. When you are dealing with an epidemic at the early stages ‚Äì there‚Äôs such a variable. But now for political reason people are far more aware of the virus so it won‚Äôt be as epidemic as it was early on. There‚Äôs far more awareness and controlled environment and changes in social behaviour. Which I‚Äôm not sure is taken into account in the models. So it should spread far less outside of Wuhan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f06uuc/clsa_conference_call_with_coronavirus_expert/,0.0,"['&gt; Three things the virus does not like: 1) sunlight, 2) temperature, and 3) humidity.   \n\n""Really meh...""  \nTime to fit in more outdoor exercise in the next month or two.']"

If even asymptomatic people can spread the virus, then it will be much, much harder to slow its spread.\n\n&gt; Doctors in China claimed asymptomatic transmission was possible, and a letter published on Jan 30 in the New England Journal of Medicine appeared to back them up.\n\n&gt; In the letter, scientists described a cluster of infections in Germany that had started with a traveller from Shanghai. The traveller had seemed healthy during her four-day visit to Bavaria, the researchers reported, and started feeling ill only after she boarded a return flight to China.\n\n&gt; That report heightened anxiety among scientists worldwide, who said the finding suggested that containment of the coronavirus would be nearly impossible.\n\n&gt; But now health officials in Germany have raised doubts about the accuracy of that report. The visitor to Germany had ""mild unspecific symptoms"" while she was still in Germany, said Ms Marieke Degen, a spokesman with the Robert Koch Institute, Germany\'s public health institute, headquartered in Berlin.\n\n&gt; The woman\'s symptoms, including back pain, had been vague, and she had taken antipyretic medication, according to Bavarian health authorities and scientists at the institute. Antipyretic drugs are used not only to relieve fever, but also as painkillers and for their anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n&gt; Health officials reported their findings last week to the Early Warning and Response System of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Ms Degen said; their criticism was first reported by Science magazine.\n\n&gt; Whatever the inaccuracies in the journal report, many experts remain concerned about the potential for the coronavirus to be spread by asymptomatic individuals, in large part because of anecdotal information received from their colleagues in China.\n\n&gt; ""This paper may or may not be flawed - it needs further investigation,"" said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Guess what is the school going to do due to MOE uping measures against coronavirus?

1. No physical contact. Orientation group leaders don't touch the new JC1.

2. Cancelation of mass games and mass dances. Basically any activities that has a big concentration of people.

3. No lunch or dinner together in school. Go home and eat.

This is where the rant begins and with current info I have, these measures are rather ineffective and simply put, dumb.

Firstly, what if someone injure themselves, are you not going to help them because physical contact prohibited? When you are moving from locations to locations with a lot of people, chances of accidentally touching people is very high.

Secondly, without having meals or mass activities, how is the JC1 cohort going ro bond with each other and make friends? Their orientation experience is practically ruined. They might as well not come to school or cancel orientation all together because they probably come to school just for admin talks and information on subjects. These information can be disseminated online and let these JC1 students access on school website.

These measures are not practical. What should be done or could be done is to ensure the JC1

1. Take temperature every morning.
2. Do not come to school if there are any signs of symptoms.
3. Wash hands or use hand sanitizer before every activities.
4. Do not touch anyone or your own face.

Preventive measures should be implemented properly and not in such an extreme manner. I understand how contagious Wu Han is, but suitable measures should be taken and not just go nuclear. I have no problems if these measures are reasonable. This wastes the efforts and logistics put in by the people planning orientation and I truly feel bad for them. Most importantly, the new JC1 students will not have an experience they can remember throughout their time.

67,singapore,212412,Coronavirus: S'pore reports first cases of local transmission; 4 out of 6 new cases did not travel to China,eynxb2,eaterasers,1580810797,16,1,"SINGAPORE - Singapore has recorded its first cases of local coronavirus transmission, with four women here infected who had not travelled to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.

Two work at Yong Thai Hang, a Chinese health products shop in Cavan Road in Lavender which caters to Chinese tour groups.

The third is a maid of one of the women, while the fourth is a tour guide who had taken groups to the same shop.

The tour group in question has since returned to China.

In addition, another two confirmed cases were announced on Tuesday (Feb 4).

The two were among a group of 92 people flown back to Singapore from Wuhan on a Scoot flight last Thursday. Before this, another two on the same flight had been reported as confirmed cases.

In total, there are now 24 confirmed cases in Singapore.


The new cases constitute ""limited local transmission"", the Health Ministry said on Tuesday.

""There is however no widespread evidence of widespread community transmission,"" said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong at a press conference.

""It is possible that there could be broader community spread despite our best efforts,"" he told reporters.

Should that happen, Singapore will consider additional measures to reduce human-to-human interactions, such as cancelling mass gatherings, suspending schools, and paring down non-essential care services, to slow the spread of disease.

The country has been preparing for such clusters, and measures implemented so far have been directed towards preventing and containing the risk of spread beyond such local clusters, to the broader community, MOH said.

As surveillance has been stepped up, more such local clusters are expected, including more cases of local transmission, it added.

The ministry has also started contact tracing so as to ringfence the cluster and limit further spread.

Cases with limited community transmission are not unexpected, said Mr Gan, who co-chairs a multi-ministry task force to defend the country against the virus.

""This is a scenario which we are prepared for,"" he said, noting that efforts will help reduce the risk of escalation.

""As the situation evolves we will step up our posture accordingly to further contain the situation in Singapore.""

With local transmission happening here, the Government is stepping up cleaning of public areas, as well as measures to lower the risk for vulnerable groups such as young children and the elderly.

To keep students safe, for instance, schools will implement staggered recess times, and stop activities such as mass assemblies and school camps. Eldercare facilities will also suspend excursions and large-scale gatherings.

As an added precaution, the authorities said they are also contacting people with similar profiles to the four cases of local transmission, who have had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to China.

In addition, all patients with pneumonia at public hospitals have been tested for the 2019-nCoV, as the virus is called, since last week.

Current evidence suggests that the virus can be spread by droplets from infected individuals, and the best way to prevent this is through personal hygiene and social responsibility. Businesses and organisations are also advised to clean their premises more often, especially high-traffic areas.

The earlier 18 confirmed cases of the virus here were all imported, comprising 16 Chinese nationals and two Singaporeans who had all travelled recently to Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province.

One has been discharged, said the ministry on Tuesday.

The update was given after a two-day lull on Sunday and Monday, when no new cases were reported.

The coronavirus outbreak shows no signs of abating, and while Singapore has put in place multiple lines of defence to check cases coming in from abroad or being passed within the community, it must prepare for a long fight against the virus, Mr Gan told Parliament on Monday.

It was first reported in Wuhan late last year. As of Monday, it had infected more than 20,000 people and claimed over 420 lives, mainly in China.

Outside mainland China, there have been close to 300 cases and two deaths, one each in Hong Kong and the Philippines.

Global authorities have warned of more person-to-person spread, with the United States, Thailand, South Korea and Hong Kong all reporting local transmission.

On Tuesday, Malaysian health authorities also confirmed the first citizen to be infected with the new coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 10. They said the 41-year-old Malaysian had travelled to Singapore for a meeting last month with colleagues from China - including one from Wuhan. But he showed symptoms only on Jan 29, nearly a week after he returned to Malaysia.

Chinese data suggest that the new virus, while much more contagious than Sars, is significantly less lethal, although such numbers can evolve rapidly. It very likely passed from certain wild animals to humans at the Wuhan's South China Seafood Market and then evolved into human-to-human transmission.

Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei and all non-essential travel to China, while visitors with recent travel to China or those with Chinese passports will not be allowed entry.

The six new cases:

- The 19th case is a 28-year-old Singapore resident, a woman who had no recent travel history to China. She works as a salesperson at health product shop Yong Thai Hang at 24, Cavan Road in Jalan Besar, that primarily served Chinese tourists.

She developed a sore throat and fever last Wednesday (Jan 29) and was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) last Thursday, but was discharged from hospital after her chest X-Ray result came back negative for pneumonia.

She did not leave her home at Jalan Bukit Merah from Friday to Sunday and was admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on Monday.

- The 20th case is a 48-year-old Singapore resident, a woman who also had no recent travel history to China. She lived at Hougang Street 61 and also worked at Yong Thai Hang.

She reported symptoms on Jan 25 and was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on Monday.

- The 21st case is a 44-year-old Indonesian woman who also had no recent travel history to China. She is the domestic helper of case 19, and stayed with her employer in her home at Jalan Bukit Merah. She reported symptoms on Sunday and did not leave her home since then.

She was admitted to SGH on Monday.

The 22nd and 23rd cases are Singapore residents evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30. They did not have symptoms when they boarded the flight and were quarantined when they landed in Singapore.

The two cases tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday even though they still showed no symptoms.

They are now warded in isolation rooms at NCID.

All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were, as an added precaution, tested for the coronavirus.

Case 24 is a 32-year-old Singapore resident who has no recent travel history in China.

She is a tour guide who brought tour groups to Yong Thai Hang, the same shop where cases 19 and 20 worked.

The tour guide did not show any symptoms when she went to NCID on Monday. She was immediately isolated and is now warded in an isolation room in the centre.

She tested positive for the virus on Tuesday afternoon.

Heres what i found from a straits times article
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/current-estimate-is-20-of-wuhan-virus-patients-will-become-severely-ill-says

Q: WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF THE WUHAN VIRUS?

A: The common symptoms include fever, cough, in more severe cases, shortness of breath, especially when there is pneumonia. Occasionally some symptoms may be absent, for example fever.

Q: HOW DO I KNOW IF THE COUGHING, FEVER AND OTHER RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS THAT I HAVE IS THE COMMON COLD, FLU, DENGUE OR THE WUHAN VIRUS?

A: It is not possible to distinguish clearly between the common cold, influenza and the 2019-novel coronavirus.

Even influenza, which is more common, can lead to severe disease and pneumonia. It also causes death.
However, unlike in Wuhan, there is currently no widespread community transmission in Singapore.
Hence, we would be concerned about a possible 2019-novel coronavirus infection only if one has travelled to China or if one has been in contact with a known case of the infection.
As for dengue, respiratory symptoms are less common and fever, rash, muscle aches and headaches are more common.

78,singapore,210769,A rant about the the current discussion on the coronavirus,ev0q9n,Bryanlegend,1580186779,365,1,"In this midst of the novel coronavirus spreading around the world, there seems to be a certain narrative around some commenters in this sub and even from the health minister himself, that somehow Singaporeans are revealing their xenophobic tendencies when reacting to the outbreak. I think it is absolutely abhorrent to be making political insinuations at this current juncture, given that this is completely a non political issue and any attempts to view it from that lens should be utterly rejected.

Now to be clear, my heart goes out to the people in China who are fighting the outbreak. But at the same time, it is a false dichotomy to suggest that being empathetic to their plight cannot coexist with taking more actions, drastic or otherwise, to assuage the worry and anxiety of the populace here in our own country.

It is not xenophobic to suggest that Singapore should consider a travel ban on China or other more drastic quarantine measures. With the first 4 cases in Singapore, I was initially convinced that current measures for screening were adequate. But given the new emergence of an asymptomatic carrier, it would appear that such methods are no longer foolproof. If the government‚Äôs only reaction is to invoke a 14 days leave of absence for those who travelled to China, then I think like many other commenters I have little faith that it will be effective, due to many other factors. If a travel ban is not feasible, it is the government‚Äôs responsibility to come up with other measures, but more must be done.

It is not anti-immigration to suggest that Singapore‚Äôs inclination towards foreign immigration makes it more susceptible to viruses and diseases that might be spread from overseas. We can do a cost-benefit analysis another day, but we cannot deny this is one of the drawbacks an open immigration policy will incur.

It is not racist to condemn people who partake and endorse the culture of eating ÈáéÂë≥. Obviously not all Chinese people partake in this, but the fact remain that many zoonotic diseases are derived from improper handling of bushmeats or wild animals and anyone in support of these, whether in a personal or group capacity, should be condemned.

It is not discrimination to want to avoid being in the vicinity of anyone from Wuhan/China, or who travelled to these locations in the past 14 days, given the existence of asymptomatic carriers, and the high virulence of the virus. It is a matter of basic public health consideration.

It is not bias to doubt the veracity of official information, or any other information derived from China‚Äôs official updates, given the history of China‚Äôs censorship and past handling of SARS.

It is not sensationalist to suggest that the virus could be much more serious than the cases that have happened in Singapore. Many of my friends and family are still convinced that the virus is no more lethal than a normal flu, since the perception given is that everything is under control, with no deaths in Singapore as of right now. In fact, because the virus exhibits symptoms extremely similar to the normal flu for a healthy individual, more care must be taken to prevent the vulnerable from being infected. Otherwise, it would just be a ticking time bomb before someone who is vulnerable gets infected.

So please, the next time before you start making xenophobic claims, remember that just because you‚Äôre healthy and strong and can likely resist the virus, does not mean you can invalidate the concerns of those who have a weaker immune system, painting all their concerns, worries, suggestions in the same brush as xenophobia and overreactions, because these are the people who have a genuine cause for concern.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ev0q9n/a_rant_about_the_the_current_discussion_on_the/,0.0,"['Why do you talk like that?

As for those with respiratory symptoms such as a cough or runny nose, a surgical mask will do and an N95 mask is not necessary, stressed the chief of Singapore\'s infectious diseases centre.\n\n&gt; Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), said surgical masks can help block large-particle droplets from reaching others.\n\n&gt; ""For people without any respiratory symptoms, there is no need to put on a surgical mask. We need to have a community effort - for those individuals who display symptoms, put on a mask. This will give safety margins to many of the people without symptoms around them,"" Prof Leo told reporters at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) on Saturday (Jan 25).\n\n&gt; She was speaking on the sidelines of a visit by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong to the hospital on the first day of Chinese New Year.\n\n&gt; Prof Leo explained that surgical masks, which have two layers, are well-designed to reduce exposure of the wearer\'s respiratory secretions to others.\n\n&gt; ""The inner layer is able to absorb many of the secretions that we release from our respiratory system. The masks are therefore able to capture droplets we produce when we cough, sneeze or talk,"" she said.\n\n&gt; Stressing that most viruses spread through the transmission of droplets, Prof Leo added: ""There are large particles that you have to catch and surgical masks are good enough to do that.""\n\n&gt; In contrast, the N95 mask is a specially-designed respirator used in environments such as hospitals.\n\n&gt; ""In healthcare settings, you use the N95 mask because it\'s a very concentrated area where you take care of patients. All healthcare workers have to go through fittings to make sure a particular brand of N95 can fit well onto their faces and that there are no gaps in between,"" said Prof Leo.\n\n&gt; N95 masks, which are tighter fitting, are designed to effectively filter airborne particles. They have been used in Singapore during haze situations.\n\n&gt; Masks have been flying off the shelves here since the Wuhan virus outbreak.\n\n&gt; Related Story Wuhan virus: Key moments of the outbreak so far\n\n&gt; Checks by The Straits Times at five pharmacies on Wednesday found that four had run out of N95 masks and three were out of surgical masks.\n\n&gt; Three people in Singapore are confirmed to have the Wuhan virus, as at the last update by MOH on Friday afternoon.\n\n&gt; The first confirmed case is a 66-year-old man from Wuhan who is here on holiday. He is currently in stable condition at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH).\n\n&gt; His 37-year-old son who was travelling with him has since been confirmed to have the virus too. He is also at SGH and in stable condition.\n\n&gt; In addition, another Chinese tourist - a 53-year-old woman from Wuhan who came separately from the two men - has been confirmed as having the virus. She is warded at the NCID and her condition is stable.\n\n&gt; Prof Leo said: ""This is still a very new virus and we are still in the learning curve. The important thing is to understand it\'s a disease that can be transmitted between humans. We therefore have to observe personal hygiene to protect ourselves and the community.""\n\n&gt; Related Story Wuhan virus: All public hospitals in Singapore capable of treating confirmed patients\n\n&gt; Speaking to the media at TTSH, Mr Gan urged the public to observe personal hygiene while enjoying the Chinese New Year festivities.\n\n&gt; He also thanked all healthcare workers who are on duty during the festive period.\n\n&gt; ""Many of them have sacrificed their festive holidays. Instead of being with their family members, they have come back to work in order to take care of our patients and loved ones,"" said Mr Gan.\n\n&gt; Many healthcare workers, including private general practitioners (GPs), are at the front line of virus outbreaks and play an important role in the detection of suspected cases, the minister added.\n\n&gt; MOH has been working with GPs, clinics and hospitals to ensure that adequate protective gears are provided to them, he said.\n\n&gt; Mr Gan visited more than 40 staff members and patients in several wards, handing out red packets and oranges.\n\n&gt; He also joined more than 50 TTSH staff in a lo hei toss.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

Also according to Chinese news, the sheer amount of people that escaped Wuhan before the lockdown comes up to hundreds of thousands, for example about 60,000 of them to Beijing and another 50,000 to Shanghai. Other nearby cities also have at least tens of thousands of people that left from Wuhan.

I mean of course I'm not saying that these people all got infected recently - they could just be discovered but... this is pretty serious right? The suspected cases have also increased to 2000++ and the hospitals in Wuhan are actually asking for donations of masks and supplies because they're running out. Deaths have also increased from 7, 14, 27 and now 41. Previously patients were older or younger people, but as of today there was one death of a 37 year old with no existing medical conditions (3 days fever and passed away), and one death of a doctor aged 62. 

Not that I want to spread fear or whatever, but shouldn't we be doing something pro-active instead of doing something reactive when shit hits the fan??? I have elderly at home (90++ years old), and I just lost my grandfather last week to some other lung related illness. He was in his early 70s and that really sucked.

By George Yeo

Singapore, 17 January 2020

&amp;#x200B;

**Human Solidarity in a Fragmenting World**

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

&amp;#x200B;

I first heard of Prof Ransome from my elder brother, Peter.  He is 7 years my senior.  When he was in Medical School, I was in Secondary School and shared a room with him in our old house at East Coast Terrace.  He would often tell me stories about this remarkable English doctor who could diagnose diseases accurately, often based only on observation, palpation and even by smell.  

&amp;#x200B;

When Dr Sayampanathan asked me early last year if I could deliver the Gordon Arthur Ransome Oration, I resonated immediately, my mind going back to stories I heard a long time ago.  I thank the Singapore  Academy of Medicine for giving me this signal honour.

&amp;#x200B;

This Oration was originally planned to be held in Hong Kong last December in conjunction with an event co-organized by the Academies of Medicine of Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.  Unfortunately, that event had to be cancelled because of the unsettled situation in Hong Kong.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hong Kong**

&amp;#x200B;

No one expected the protests which began in June last year to become so big and to last so long. As a legislator of many years, I decided to download the Extradition Bill and read it for myself. Frankly, I did not find the proposed amendments to existing laws unreasonable.  It did not seem right that one could  commit rape or murder in China and find sanctuary in Hong Kong.  

&amp;#x200B;

However, most Hongkongers viewed the Bill differently and were outraged that the Chief Executive Carrie Lam was determined to get it passed despite mass opposition. Looking back, the Bill was only the spark that set off a forest fire.  For many years after the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997, the fuel load in the forest had been building up.  Social injustice had gotten worse.  Most parents in Hong Kong no longer believed that their children could do better than them.  As a result, there is not a sense of hope and, without a sense of hope, society turns sour.  The lack of affordable housing is egregious.  

&amp;#x200B;

During colonial times, the HK civil service was conditioned to take instructions from London.  The British approach was to govern firmly but lightly unless their core interests were affected, leaving people to fend for themselves.  After 1997, Beijing left Hong Kong to govern itself, not giving instructions the way London did. However, the HK Adminstration changed little; vested interests remained comfortably in place; and political leadership was lacking.  Hong Kong has a well-developed social and economic establishment but not a political establishment.  Under the British, it was not desirable for Hong Kong to have its own political culture.  Perhaps China should have been more interventionist after 1997 but, for a variety of reasons, including the selfish interest of groups from the Mainland which found Hong Kong‚Äôs separate status convenient, it left things be.

&amp;#x200B;

Worse, the people of Hong Kong had to struggle with an identity crisis.  Older Hongkongers had fled the Mainland during earlier periods of upheaval and distrusted Beijing - 1949, the Great Leap Forward, the mass famine of the early 60‚Äôs, the Cultural Revolution and June 4th.  The majority of teachers from Primary One to University are anti-Mainland and pass prejudices against China, especially against the Chinese Communist Party, on to their charges.  To be a student leader in university, you have to honour June 4th.  Most Hongkongers know that they cannot be independent but many prefer not to identify themselves as Chinese citizens.  At the top, they hold multiple passports.  

&amp;#x200B;

When Deng Xiaoping proposed One Country, Two Systems, the precondition for it to work was that Hongkongers must not only love Hong Kong, they must also love China.  ‰∏ÄÂõΩ‰∏§Âà∂ÔºåÁà±ÂõΩÁà±Ê∏ØÔºåÊ∏Ø‰∫∫Ê≤ªÊ∏Ø. In fact, loving China should come first but it will take time and much effort for that to be put right.  National education in Hong Kong has been neglected for too long.

&amp;#x200B;

After leaving government in 2011, I joined Robert Kuok in Hong Kong.  My wife and I shuttle back and forth between the two cities. Hong Kong has become for us a second home.  We now have our own social circle there including a number of young Hongkongers interested in politics.  Some of them are yellow, some are blue; all feel deeply for Hong Kong.  We ourselves have developed an affection for Hong Kong and its people, and decided, after my retirement as Chairman of Kerry Logistics last year, to buy an apartment near Hong Kong University. Like many others, we were shocked by the rapid deterioration of Hong Kong in the last 8 months.  Unlike many others, we remain cautiously optimistic for Hong Kong‚Äôs long term future because of its special position half-in and half-out of China and the resilience of its people. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is however not my intention to talk principally about Hong Kong today.  The reason for my raising Hong Kong is because there are larger, deeper forces at work in Hong Kong which affect the whole world.  We have to be mindful of them because they affect us in Singapore too.  These forces are unleashed by technology and challenge us morally.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to highlight four in particular - the social media revolution, fragmentation and reconfiguration of human society, growing wealth and income inequality, and mass manipulation by new masters of the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

**Social Media Revolution**

&amp;#x200B;

First, the social media revolution.

&amp;#x200B;

When the Internet arrived in the 90‚Äôs, many  saw it as liberating.  It became much easier to access information.  Patients have already googled their symptoms before seeing doctors and everything the doctor said and prescribed could be counter checked on the net.  

&amp;#x200B;

In the same way, teachers are challenged by students, and government leaders by the citizenry. At home, parents have come to accept that, for many things and in many areas, they have to rely on their children for information and advice.  

&amp;#x200B;

The social media revolution has disrupted old relationships.  Everywhere, we see hierarchies breaking down.  Old institutions, once preserved and sustained by ritual, secrecy, information asymmetry, hypocrisy, deception and force are being corroded.  Traditional leaders are dragged down from their ivory towers and shown to be quite ordinary and fallible after all, their hypocrisy and corruption exposed by ubiquitous cameras and microphones. 

&amp;#x200B;

When Pope Francis smacked an Asian lady twice on the arm after she grabbed him by his sleeve in St Peter‚Äôs Square and refused to let go, it immediately became news all over the world.  The Pope quickly apologised the day after.  A Mainland Chinese friend of mine told me that it actually made the Pope look quite good because it showed him to be human.  It is just as well that Francis, since becoming Pope, frequently declares himself a sinner.

&amp;#x200B;

Old leadership models have become obsolete.  Whether it is Pope Francis, President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Elon Musk or Greta Thunberg, we are in a new situation.  It sometimes seems as if a necessary qualification for leadership is to be publicly a sinner. The term used nowadays is ‚Äòauthenticity‚Äô although that too is often manufactured.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fragmentation and Reconfiguration of Human Society**

&amp;#x200B;

Human society takes time to adjust to new technologies.  The IT revolution shows no sign of abating.  In fact it is setting off concomitant change in other technological fields like biomedicine, material science and manufacturing.  These changes in turn act upon one another, often in unexpected ways, causing even further disruption to the old order. 

&amp;#x200B;

In his analysis of economic cycles, the Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, wrote about creative destruction.  What we see all around is the destructive phase of the technological revolution which is fragmenting human society.  This fragmentation, which is the second force I am highlighting today, defines the age we live in.

&amp;#x200B;

Going back to Hong Kong, what characterises the protest movement is its fluid, leaderless, organic character.  The social media reinforces beliefs and biases.  Those who are yellow watch yellow sites, get angrier and become more yellow.  For many, police officers have become the villains and even their family members are targeted. For those who are blue, the demonstrators are cockroaches to be smacked down. Views become highly, absurdly polarised.  We hear of couples breaking up and parents who are no longer able to talk to their children.  Unmediated positive feedback loops quickly become unstable. The same phenomenon is evident in the US today, Taiwan during the recent elections, the UK when the Brexit debate was raging, and in many other countries.

&amp;#x200B;

Fragmentation is however not the end state.  Gradually, the fragments recombine in new ways, similar to the pattern of neural networks. Nodes grow and compete with other nodes with which they are linked through multiple pathways.  There is a biological quality about these new forms of organization.  It is almost as if we are witnessing a Cambrian explosion of diverse organisational species.  Those which successfully adapt to the new environment proliferate while others reach dead ends.  Apple, Samsung and Huawei have very different organisational structures and systems.  Which among them will still be successful ten years from now no one can foretell but for sure that there will be new winners and losers.  

&amp;#x200B;

Losing faith in existing institutions, there is at one level a reversion to tribal networks of trust. Some of these networks are based on ethnicity and religion.  Some years ago, Joel Koetkin in his book ‚ÄòTribes‚Äô wrote about the tribal networks which undergird global commerce like those of the Mormons, Jews, Parsees, Jains, Armenians and Chinese.  Among the Chinese, there are regional networks which stand out like the Wenzhou connection.  We also see new tribal networks forming around specific causes such as LGBT rights, climate activism, even veganism.

&amp;#x200B;

There is an obverse and negative side to this phenomenon.  Networks like Al Qaeda and ISIS have similar morphologies but are destructive.  Anti-Semitism has also become more pronounced fuelled by groups which corroborate each other‚Äôs prejudices on the Internet.   Positive or negative, politicians everywhere are quick to pick up populist causes to win votes, undermining the civil society which is the bedrock of democracy.

&amp;#x200B;

Political systems are subject to the same creative destruction.  Western democratic systems no longer function well. Long-established political parties are fissuring. In many democracies, domestic political debate have become toxic. The seeming success of China‚Äôs system is an affront to western liberal democracies.  China‚Äôs authoritarian Communism is not supposed to work well.  Yet it has raised hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and enabled the country to join the front rank of nations in many fields causing the US to view it as a strategic threat. China sees its own system as unique and does not seek to export it to others.  But China‚Äôs relative success does give hope and heart to many developing countries that there are other ways to the future.  They do not have to take the path of western liberal democracies.  I say ‚Äòrelative success‚Äô because China too faces enormous challenges.  Political systems and organisations which are unable to evolve to new needs become dysfunctional and unstable.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, at all levels, from the family to companies to political structures, we see continuing fragmentation, experimentation and reconfiguration.  It is a process which can be described as Darwinian.

&amp;#x200B;

**Growing Wealth and Income Inequality**

&amp;#x200B;

The third force impacting society today is growing wealth and income inequality.

&amp;#x200B;

Wealth and income inequality in Hong Kong is an important underlying cause of the current unrest.  According to a recent study by the Asian Competitiveness Institute at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, the inequality has gotten worse in recent years.  Without a strong injection of socialism, Hong Kong society will remain fractured.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is worldwide and not confined to Hong Kong alone.  The impact of technological change on individual fortunes is uneven.  Once upon a time, hardworking, responsible employees could expect their lives to improve year by year.  Today many feel they are struggling to run up a downward-moving escalator.  Those whose work are repetitive are at great risk.  Their jobs can be outsourced to countries where labor is cheaper.  Or be replaced by robots and algorithms. 

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast, those who are well-placed to seize new opportunities created by fragmentation prosper. For example, among new graduates, computer engineers command among the highest salaries.  Many companies remain stuck in the past.  Those who are able to disrupt them become rich and are lionized.  When we look at the league table of the most successful companies in the world,  the top positions are increasingly held by those in technology.  In Singapore, Sea, which is a company specialising in gaming and e-commerce - a company which most Singaporeans have not heard of - has quite suddenly become one of the top companies, with a capitalisation half that of Singapore Telecoms.  

&amp;#x200B;

The flood of global liquidity released by central banks after the Global Financial Crisis has unfairly benefited a relatively small group of companies and individuals, accentuating wealth and income inequality in the world. Those who are well-connected to governments and to wealthy families, especially in high finance and tech, are able to access cheap money while the great majority of small and medium enterprises pay higher interest rates.  Inflation in asset prices have skewed wealth further to those who are already wealthy.  In many developing countries, those already invested in asset classes like property get richer while the rest struggle to buy a first home.  This is being perpetuated down one generation.  Many successful start-ups are founded by young men and women who are themselves scions of wealthy well-connected families.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing inequality of wealth and income exacerbates existing class and ethnic divisions in society.  In many countries, large groups resent being systematically disadvantaged and left behind. This frustration, though still inchoate, has become widespread. ‚ÄòYellow jacket‚Äô protests in France are part of this phenomenon. There are eerie similarities between the protests in Hong Kong and those far away in Barcelona and Santiago.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mass Manipulation by the New Masters of the Universe**

&amp;#x200B;

The fourth force challenging us is the way big data and the social media are being used to manipulate the way we think.

&amp;#x200B;

The first phase of the internet revolution opened the floodgates to information access and eroded old power structures.  For a short while, there was an exhilarating sense of equalisation.  That phase has ended. We are increasingly discovering how our minds are being manipulated by new masters of the universe.  

&amp;#x200B;

Companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Alibaba and Tencent make use of the enormous data they collect to squeeze out competitors and influence our preferences often without our knowledge.  In Singapore and elsewhere, a very high percentage of ad revenues is cornered by Google and Facebook because of the eyeballs they have captured.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks after the HK unrest started, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, in quick succession, blocked hundreds of sites which they claim besmirched protesters, giving the reason that these sites originated from China.  Sites which supported the protesters were untouched.  It is unclear who made these decisions but I don‚Äôt think they were made in Hong Kong. There is no doubt that the way friction is increased or reduced in different parts of the Internet can significantly sway public opinion.   Trapped in an old mindset, the Hong Kong Government was unable or unwilling to intervene.

&amp;#x200B;

Other governments have no such inhibitions.  India routinely shuts down the Internet in various cities when there are riots to calm public anger.  Kashmir was denied the Internet for months, a decision which the Indian Supreme Court judged unlawful earlier this week. When mass demonstrations erupted in Iran after fuel prices were raised, the government switched off Facebook causing Secretary Pompeo to threaten sanctions on those responsible.  In the battle for hearts and minds in Iran, the US actively intervenes in the way Facebook, Twitter and Instagram cover developments in the country.  Sympathetic coverage of General Suleimani has been systematically blocked.

&amp;#x200B;

The big powers devote considerable resources to the exploitation of the social media for political purposes.  Domestically, they may be constrained by national law.  Externally, there are no restrictions.  In 2013, Edward Snowden revealed the existence of Prism, an incredible system developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA) to collect internet information worldwide.  All governments would love to have such a capability but none can hope to, and certainly not on the same scale as the US except, possibly, China one day.

&amp;#x200B;

A key reason for the US campaign against Huawei is the fear that China may not only develop a similar surveillance capability but Chinese equipment and Chinese systems will make it harder for the US to maintain the same surveillance reach.  For some countries like Singapore, the only safe assumption is that all systems expose us to external intelligence penetration.  We have to find ways to protect ourselves and accept that nothing is foolproof.  The challenge is made much harder with increasing dependence on clouds. 

&amp;#x200B;

China makes no pretense about controlling the Internet.  President Xi himself declared that the development of the Internet is an integral part of national development and not separate from it.  All internet providers in China accept the leadership of the Communist Party. They have no choice. In fact, China is probably the first country to make extensive use of big data for national governance.  Big data analysis has enabled China to overcome a problem which afflicted its governance system over the centuries.  Because of the size of the country, there are many layers of administration making it hard for Beijing to know what‚Äôs happening on the ground.  Corrupt officials often succeed in covering up problems by working with counterparts one level above to suppress complaints.  When problems do reach the Centre, it is because they have already become big and serious.  To overcome this defect, Chinese dynasties develop elaborate systems of inspection from the Imperial Court.  Wrongs do get righted but they are so rare, the stories are immortalised in Chinese operas.  With big data analysis, it is easier for Beijing to be alerted earlier.  Information systems monitor the overall shape of data.  When there are signs of inflammation, Beijing zoom in to find out more. Once lower level officials know that it is hard to cover up, they behave better.  In fact, securities agencies like the NSA use similar methods to spot potential terrorist attacks by monitoring internet chatter.

&amp;#x200B;

In Xinjiang, China is criticized by western and Muslim countries for the way information is collected and used, including the mass deployment of facial recognition.  Whether the Chinese method of curbing terrorism is more effective than the western method of acting forcefully only when the evidence has become clear is still an open question.  The difference is not unlike the methods used for treating cancer.  The western method of tackling terrorism is akin to surgery and chemotherapy such as the use of Predator drones to kill terrorists.  The Chinese method is to treat the body politic holistically, gradually boosting its immunity.  Immunotherapy however requires patience and a deeper understanding of complex reality.  

&amp;#x200B;

For many westerners, China has become George Orwell‚Äôs 1984.  For many Chinese, the loss of privacy is a price worth paying for safety and convenience.  There is probably no safer big country than China today. But will the centralization of control lead to massive abuse one day? The Chinese Communist Party is not immune to the same forces of change in the world.  It has to evolve in response to new circumstances.  By cracking down on corruption and re-establishing moral authority, President Xi Jinping has bought time for China and the Communist Party.  

&amp;#x200B;

In the US, what intelligence and law enforcement agencies are allowed to do is the subject of a raging debate. Trump has raged against fake news since his Presidential campaign. Is the deep state out of control?  Well it depends on whom you ask.  There is also growing reaction against the big tech companies.  Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren is campaigning for their breakup, which alarms Mark Zuckerberg. She is a policy wonk and has thought through the implications of such a move.

&amp;#x200B;

In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation, commonly known as GDPR, came into force two years ago.  In provides some safeguard to the misuse or abuse of data collection.  This may make it more difficult for Europe to catch up with the US and China in AI.  However, the use of facial recognition technology is not likely to be held back because it is simply too useful.  

&amp;#x200B;

Thus we see in the world today a range of responses to the challenge of big data, in particular, the loss of privacy and the mass manipulation of public opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

In Singapore, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act, commonly known as POFMA, is a brave attempt to stem the same incoming tide.  It is not easy but we should not stop trying.

&amp;#x200B;

**Moral Challenge**

&amp;#x200B;

The revolution in IT is enabling the collection, storage and processing of data on an unprecedented scale without theoretical limit.  It is almost as if nothing that happens will ever be forgotten again.  In China, to ensure better disease control, there is an effort to recognise every pig either facially or from the back.  The pig population in China is almost half a billion.  For computer engineers, this is a trivial problem.  Every detail of every human being on the planet living today and in the future will eventually be monitored, recorded and analysed.  With AI, his probable behaviour will also be known.  It is a scary prospect.

&amp;#x200B;

This leap in the collective intelligence of human beings has a god-like quality about it.  There does not seem to be any phenomenon which we cannot as a species potentially understand.  

(As an aside, I do not believe that the kind of AI (Artificial Intelligence) Elon Musk talks about can replace collective human intelligence.  AI requires either that there is sufficient past data about collective human behaviour to predict the future or that the rules of collective human behaviour can be repeatedly simulated.  Neither condition exists.  The history of human civilisation is too short and too complex for AI to ever master.)

&amp;#x200B;

That which the technological revolution has unleashed is however two-edged.  There is always a temptation to weaponise the newest technology in order to gain a military advantage.  In the biological world, you either produce or you take away from someone else what he has produced.  Anything which lives must solve the dual challenge of production and security.  Thus every new technology is used for both creation and destruction, for both good and evil.  

&amp;#x200B;

It takes time for the moral sense of human beings to catch up with new technologies and to tame them.  In the last century, mechanisation, mass production and nuclear energy led to the slaughter of over a hundred million people.  Whether we will be wiser in this century is still an open question.  There is an air of hubris in the way the new masters of the universe view their growing capabilities.  This hubris infects us at all levels - state agencies which are carried away by the use of technology; politicians who rely on clever data analytics to manipulate voters; generals who fantasise unstoppable spears and impregnable shields; economists who believe that the manipulation of money supply can rid us of economic cycles; corporate leaders whose ambitions know no bounds; successful tribes and wealthy individuals who are convinced of their own genetic superiority; scientists who tinker with germ lines to improve the quality of human beings; and computer engineers who see AI as the ultimate.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Memento Mori**

&amp;#x200B;

It is said that in Roman times, a victorious general in a triumphal procession would have behind him a slave whispering into his ears ‚Äòmemento mori‚Äô which means ‚Äòremember, you will die‚Äô.  It is a warning against hubris, a call to humility and restraint when one is successful.

&amp;#x200B;

Whether as parents, teachers, doctors, government ministers or corporate leaders, we must therefore not lose our moral sense in the pursuit of achievement and success.  It is important to contemplate human weakness, and the meaning of suffering and death.  It is in pathos that we forge group solidarity.  In an age of fragmentation, solidarity is vital.  In everything we do, we must not ignore those who are wounded or have fallen by the wayside.  Without this social glue, civilized society breaks down.

&amp;#x200B;

Tectonic change has caused the old edifices to crumble into smaller pieces.  We must rebuild but with the expectation that the ground will continue to quake.  We need simpler structures which are flexibly linked to one another, like those in a Middle Eastern souk.  Above all, we need solidarity which is the instinct to connect and bond.

&amp;#x200B;

Solidarity

&amp;#x200B;

Human society cannot be organized on the basis of law and the market alone.  Laws only mark outer boundaries.  Laws can require parents to look after children. Laws cannot make parents love their children, or vice versa. The market is a powerful way of allocating resources in a complex economy.  But the market alone cannot solve many human problems.  We are all familiar with Adam Smith‚Äôs ‚Äòinvisible hand‚Äô but we often forget that he was first and foremost a moral philosopher.  Take the healthcare system for example.  If doctors are only bound to their patients by the money nexus, many diseases will be poorly treated or mistreated however clever AI systems become.

&amp;#x200B;

Human society needs solidarity as a cohesive force to bind human beings together in cooperative effort.  In traditional Confucius teaching, stress is put on five core values:  ‰ªÅ‰πâÁ§ºÊô∫‰ø° - broadly speaking meaning benevolence, justice, proper behaviour, wisdom and trust.  All moral systems incorporate and elaborate these values.  These values are deep in our nature and probably encoded in our DNA.  

&amp;#x200B;

In order to remain relevant, these moral systems, which include religion and ideology, must adapt to new challenges thrown up by technology.  Take Á§º or proper behaviour as an example.  For human beings to interact, we need protocols facilitating communication and cooperation.  When individuals are masked, whether in public or on the Internet, protocols are hard to establish.  In anonymous settings, individuals quickly become irresponsible and abusive.  Civilised behaviour requires behavioral responses which are generally agreed to and therefore predictable.  Interestingly, it is protocols like TCP/IP which made possible the Internet in the first place. The fact of the matter is that there can be no freedom without accountability. Without a moral sense, the new freedom which technology offers destroys itself.  

&amp;#x200B;

At the heart of the situation in Hong Kong today is a moral crisis. Two nights ago in Hong Kong, I had dinner with Gary Wong, a young Hong Kong political leader whom I have known for some years.  Together with Jasper Tsang, former President of Legco, Raymond Mak, another young political leader whom I had dinner with the night PolyU was encircled and five others, they decided in the late evening of 18 November to enter PolyU which was then under siege by Hong Kong Police in order to persuade the few hundred remaining diehard protestors to leave.  They made the decision after receiving a WhatsApp message from a young girl in PolyU with a heartrending plea for help. After consulting Government leaders, the Police agreed for the group to enter on the understanding that the Police could not ensure their safety.  Indeed, they were greeted by arrows on the draw pointed at them as they crossed the barricade. The campus was a war zone.  They were shocked that among the protestors were many who were well-educated, some from well-to-do families. There were some girls who were as young as 12. Eventually, they succeeded in persuading some 70 protestors to leave.  There were loud cheers when they came out. Not only by the crowd outside PolyU, but by many all over Hong Kong watching the drama on television and the social media. Chief Executive Carrie Lam decided wisely that those below the age of 18 could go home once they had their names registered. 

&amp;#x200B;

The polarization  in Hong Kong had reached a point when protestors who wanted to leave did not believe they could trust the authorities.  The majority of Hong Kong youth today has developed a visceral antipathy toward the Hong Kong Police,  Yet it was not long ago when the Hong Kong Police was rated among the best in the world.  And, from the other side, among many in authority and the older generation, there is anger and grief vis-a-vis a younger generation which had seemingly turned wayward.  It will take time to clean the wounds and for the wounds to heal.  China has despatched former Party Secretary of Qinghai and Shanxi, Luo Huining, to Hong Kong.  He is new to Hong Kong and will bring a fresh mind to bear on the problems.  He will have to work with Hong Kong leaders who showed physical and moral courage, and wisdom, during the recent crisis to restore solidarity in Hong Kong and between Hong Kong and the Mainland.

&amp;#x200B;

In all fields, we need moral leadership.  The great danger today is the revolution in technology outpacing the evolution of our moral sense. Whether in the private, public or people sector, in grappling with economic and technical questions, we should never de-emphasise moral considerations.  It is common nowadays for decisions to be taken in an amoral way. An indifferent, amoral approach in a period of rapid technological change is possibly the greatest danger to humankind today. We must not be beguiled by a so-called post-truth world.  The more complex the world becomes, the more must we affirm that which is at the core of our humanity.

The human quality of Prof Gordon Arthur Ransome as described by Prof Seah Cheng Siang is therefore worth recalling.

‚ÄúHe is always ready to render a helping hand when a fellow doctor himself is in trouble.  ...he has an ever constant ear which in itself is therapy.  Time appears to him to be of no consequence when it comes to giving it to someone else.  The distressed talks on and he listens. A few careful chosen words of advice now and then provides the panacea.‚Äù

**Abstract**

&amp;#x200B;

Information technology is altering power relationships in human society.  The first stage is destructive.  Old institutions and hierarchies, preserved and sustained by ritual, secrecy, information asymmetry, hypocrisy, deception and force are being corroded.  For example, the social media has forced leaders down from their ivory towers revealing them for what they are, warts and all. The relationship between parents and children, teachers and students, priests and laity, government and governed is all changing causing great stress to traditional society.  The old world is fragmenting.  The pieces are however reconnecting in new ways with patterns more akin to neural networks.  New nodes are forming with multiple connections in ceaseless competition with other nodes.  This reconfiguration is still in the initial stages.  The gathering and processing of vast amounts of data create new power centers. Edward Snowden revealed the scope of US National Security Agency‚Äôs Prism project.  The Chinese Government is concentrating more data than anyone else and using it not only for surveillance but also to reduce corruption and improve governance.  Huawei is but one example of the overt and covert competition for data at the political level.  Commercially, tech conglomerates like Facebook, Google, Amazon, Tencent and Alibaba have been expanding at the expense of traditional players.  There is now a growing political backlash at them.  In the west, there are calls to limit their power either by breaking them up or regulating them more tightly especially in the way they make use of private data.  In China, all tech companies know that they cannot afford to run afoul of the Chinese Communist Party.  Will big data and AI lead to ever growing concentration of power?  Is the future 1984?  Or will clever computer minds succeed in creating decentralized internet webs and decentralized AI?  It will take time for human relationships and human institutions to adapt to the revolution in technology.  In the meantime, we must expect a long transition marked by disruption and confusion.  All major advances in technology are marked by a choice between good and evil. Our moral sense is still struggling to catch up with the new powers being unleashed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/er8vrm/human_solidarity_in_a_fragmenting_world_by_george/,0.0,['my moral sense and solidarity cant allow me to put up a staunch defense for a convicted pedophile']

88,singapore,237002,A discussion on advocacy and activism in Singapore,gofcww,Bryanlegend,1590135524,110,1,"I am writing this as a current Social Work student, and this piece is wholly my opinion. This also serves as a discussion piece for those of you interested in this topic to leave any relevant comments, and I will try my best to engage constructively. I will not provide a TL;DR version as it is best to read this in full if you want to fully understand what I am trying to say.

For those of you familiar with Social Work, one of the core values of the Social Work profession, as defined in the Code of Professional Ethics, is Social Justice. Advocacy and activism is also defined as key concepts in Social Work to achieve social justice and people empowerment. However, in Singapore‚Äôs context, and especially among peers and educators in the Social Work field, I feel that activism/advocacy has always been the elephant in the room. While many Social Workers here can empathise with the plights of those who actively seek to invoke change through advocacy/activism, very few are inclined to trod down the same path, as such actions are often seen as taboo or socially unacceptable, and often does not bode well in terms of career prospects.

Both advocacy and activism against the current status quo have always been actively discouraged in Singapore‚Äôs context, and some activists like Jolovan Wham and Kirsten Han sometimes run afoul of the law while trying to promote certain social changes. Other activists/advocates might not run afoul of the law, but are still often vilified by mainstream media or pro-incumbent commentators as agitators working against national interests, or simply just do-gooders with scant regard of national unity in times of crises. This is especially eminent in the context of COVID-19, where migrant workers rights have been extensively discussed. However, this can also refer to long-standing activism in other areas, including LGBT rights and free speech advocates (most notably those against POFMA)

I‚Äôm writing this piece because I have grown increasingly frustrated with the narrative that social activist/advocates are people who are ungrateful and who choose to only focus on the negatives. It is akin to saying healthcare workers are pessimists for monitoring and focusing on the debilitating symptoms of patients. Social Workers exist to bring about changes in marginalised sectors in the community to the best of their abilities. It is their job to identify discriminatory or negative traits of society and to bring them to light in order to remedy them. It is blatant disrespect to assume that activism (i.e. civil disobedience etc) is their first course of action when it is very likely to be their last resort, after negotiation and communications with relevant authorities have failed over a period of time.

However, my quip is not solely with people who oppose any change to the status quo with all their vehement fervour, or who openly deride such activists/advocates.

Certain people who are conservative in some religious groups will always be against LGBT rights. Certain people with business and political interests will always cite the trade-offs between migrant worker safety and economic viability, and if forced to choose one, will choose one. Certain people (and governments!) who value a paternalistic stance on collective security will never view free speech in a positive light.

What really irks me is how the seemingly average and moderate Singaporean remains critical of activism and advocacy, despite them being sympathetic to the various causes. In my many conversations with friends and family (or even strangers online) regarding said topics, they invariably follow the same vein of thought. 

‚ÄúOh I support LGBT rights, I just don‚Äôt think they should make such a huge fuss about 377A because it‚Äôs not enforced, and besides we just need to wait until society is less conservative and more ready. No point for conflict now and no point to go protest at Pink Dot.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh I absolutely agree that there should transparency and accountability in migrant worker issues. We definitely need to do more for them. It‚Äôs just that this is not the right time to discuss it when everyone is busy working on it and since it‚Äôs such a huge national crisis we cannot be divisive. Maybe when this is all over we can come back and relook this topic.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah I don‚Äôt think POFMA is a good idea. But I think people should just follow and not challenge it at all. If there‚Äôs anything wrong they can just go to the courts or appeal against it, and time will tell if they are right‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah our nurses are being paid quite lowly and some of them are angry that they are valued less than swabbers, but we need swabbers urgently, so let‚Äôs just talk about nurse wages another time and focus at the thing at hand.‚Äù

Realise the one thing in common? It‚Äôs always about waiting for the right time, for the right environment, but no one can put it at a definitive date, and we are all expected to just go along with it.

I understand Singapore cannot change overnight. We cannot suddenly become kinder, less racially divisive, and less discriminatory of certain minority groups. But we cannot continue to be enablers of injustices as well, however passive that might be, however socially convenient it might be to do so. 

In Martin Luther King‚Äôs words, justice delayed is justice denied. I leave an excerpt of his Letter from a Birmingham Jail, in which he addressed white moderates who seemingly agree with his aims, but not his actions. I feel this is especially relevant in virtually all struggles minorities and persecuted members of societies face today, and not just in Singapore.

(‚ÄúFirst, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;"" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.‚Äù)

I will admit, I myself have been a passive enabler on many occasions, choosing to be civil and going with the flow rather than proactively seeking change. But as I look at protests and civil disobediences throughout the world, something frightens me as a prospective Social Worker. I look at how police brutality is rampant in Hong Kong protests, and yet there are people clamouring for peace and for protestors to just pack it up for the sake of economic stability. I look at how students with no political or protest experiences are thrusted into the fray overnight, for simply standing up to the values they believe in and have been taught their entire lives. I look at how ordinary citizens are arrested and beaten up, simply for refusing to give up their hard earned right to protest against what they perceive to be an unjust system.

While I am thankful that there is no basis for such violence and malignancy in Singapore, there remains a small part of my conscience nibbling at me. What if one day, the Singapore I fight for is no longer the Singapore I know? What if one day, as a Social Worker, one of the causes I am so passionate in becomes taboo to speak about? Do I remain civil and back down? Or is there something in this world worth fighting for, and worth standing up for, even if the consequences placed upon me by the state or authorities would be severe? Would I have to dissent according to my best and most genuine intentions or should I reluctantly acquiesce for the sake of civility, and become the very same ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù that enabled the injustice I had worked so hard to prevent all these years?

Already, dissent is strongly frowned upon here. I read with great disappointment that the simple act of holding a cardboard with a smiley face can be considered a violation of the Public Order Act and is liable for police investigation. 

You might say, it‚Äôs his problem for choosing to support climate justice activists, for not following the law against public assembly, for doing it despite being already placed in the public spotlight.

But think about it, what if one day the thing you so strongly believes in becomes a criminal offence, or something socially unacceptable? What if you have to forgo your dignity to the profession and calling you undertook or the values that have defined you as an unique human being?

The people on the right side today are often on the wrong side in history. Change often comes at the expense of the status quo. Let‚Äôs be kinder and less critical of people who spend their lives fighting what they perceive to be an unjust system. I am not saying you should join and support them at all costs, but at the very least, understand where they are coming from.

90,singapore,235712,Living in isolation with major depression,gkp274,porowhale,1589605730,159,1,"In the midst of a depressive episode, I left my family and rented an apartment on the opposite side of Singapore. For once, I felt free and independent. I no longer had to tiptoe around eggshells, nor did I ever burst into tears over toxic remarks made by my family members. I could give myself some distance while working on my issues. I was able to choose the people who were allowed into my life and new home. For awhile, my life felt okay, until the announcement of the Circuit Breaker. 


In an instant, I no longer had any physical or face to face contact with my friends and loved ones. I worked from home alone behind a laptop screen, and ate takeouts for weeks. As someone who relied on social interaction and a fixed routine to deal with my mental illness, I felt ruined by the pandemic. 


I didn't leave the house, let alone my bed. Empty shelves in the supermarket meant that I survived mainly on frozen snacks. I stopped taking my antidepressants. I no longer took care of my personal hygiene. Trash and dishes piled up while I began to break down. Work became even more overwhelming than usual, and my isolation felt suffocating. 


I was aware that I could leave my house at any time to take a walk, to take a deep breath and comfort myself. As many apathetic people would tell me, ""Just stop thinking about the negative!"". But leaving the house was a goal that was too far away. Taking a step outside felt too exhausting, too much for me to handle. Leaving the house still meant that I'll be alone. I would never be able run into the arms of my loved ones. After all, we're not allowed to interact with anyone outside, and I was also 30km away from them. News broke that a relative of mine had committed suicide. No funeral or proper goodbyes could be held. 


Extensions of the circuit breaker and discussions on how long it'll take before life could get back to normal made it hard for me to breathe. Normalcy is all I hoped for, and hope was fading. I felt driven over the edge. I still am. 


Prior to the circuit breaker, I spent years in therapy. I made really good progress, and was told that I could finally graduate from my therapist at the start of this year. The pandemic left me with loose ends regarding my therapy, my relationship with my family, and progression in my life.


I can empathize with online videos on social media of people throwing furniture off buildings, of people making a scene in public. I wanted to act like a child, screaming and throwing fits in public so that I can somehow be heard. I wanted people to give in to my selfish requests. I felt angry over everyone and every country which played a part in the spread of the virus. I felt frustration over the changes I was forced to endure. 


Isolation felt like a personal attack towards me. Logic told me that I was being ridiculous, but depression told me that everything that has happened was done on purpose because I didn't deserve love and social interaction. I didn't deserve the normalcy that I desperately wanted. I am not allowed to be happy. I am not permitted good things in my life. I believe that had I not have gone through therapy, I would have already fallen apart.


To end this off, here are some of the things I've done to keep myself sane:

- Forcing myself to take a shower

 Taking a shower regularly gives me a push to take care of other parts of myself, such as skincare and dental hygiene. Rather than just showers, the more accurate term would be to create a list of 'bare minimums'. I can spend my day doing nothing, but I must at least complete my 'bare minimums' such as taking a shower, eating breakfast and taking my pills.


- Befriending myself

 Like the movie ""Inside Out"", I envision my feelings as individual components of who I am. My sadness and anger often dominates my mind, but I remind myself that these are just emotions inside of me, and not who I am as a person. I don't have to act how they want me to, I just have to acknowledge that these feelings exists.


- Mothering myself

 Similar to befriending myself, I remind myself to be kind. I am understanding of my problems, and acknowledge its existence. I am patient towards myself and celebrate small achievements like getting myself out of bed. Like a mother towards a child, I only want the best for myself, and will encourage myself gently.


- Don't suppress your emotions

 Even if you're afraid of rejection, speak to someone you trust or go to an anonymous public platform to share your thoughts and mental state. Being vulnerable opens up conversations, and may provide you with support. Writing is something that I've always found cathartic, and was also a method my therapist encouraged me to do.


Everyone is having a tough time during the pandemic. This is a known fact. You're not alone if you have depressive symptoms. It is okay to not come out of circuit breaker mastering new languages or having a summer-ready body. Those are privileges that not everyone can afford. 


Depression is equivalent to the common cold, in the realm of mental disorders. Job loss, grief, and social isolation are events that many face, and its okay to not feel okay. It is okay to be anxious and cry. But for the sake of your own mental well-being, for the sake of what is best for yourself, please keep moving no matter how paralyzing or meaningless it may feel.

I wrote this mainly to share how i've been coping with the circuit breaker, and to jot down all the thoughts that have been intruding my mind. These are things that i've been wanting to say to my boss, to my family and my friends. I try not to share my feelings with them in-depth because I don't want to cause unnecessary worry or panic. I'm more or less stable, just that it takes me time to get a hold of myself.

These cases ARE NOT included in the total number. 

**Why are we not swabbing everyone?**

There a few dorms where the number of positive swabs are so high (such as S11) that statistically if someone presents with respiratory symptoms, they are highly likely to be infected with covid and therefore there is not much point to confirming via swabs testing as these swabs can then be used for other unknown cases including those who are asymptomtic. 

**What does this mean in terms of the total number of daily cases?**

It means that the number of cases for example today which was around 600 does not represent the true number of cases since these are only cases confirmed via swabs. It is possible that several hundred more cases have been confirmed to have covid via clinical diagnosis

**Does that mean the daily statistics are useless?**

Yes and no. These clinically confirmed cases seem to just be carried out in dorms, however, as far as I know anyway, people in the community are still being confirmed solely via swabs

**Does this mean the govt are hiding the truth?**

No. Please bare in mind the current situation for everyone is extremely difficult and the workload for doctors, nurses, cleaners, volunteers including dentists etc is very heavy.

Hello redditors,

This is my first post and I need advice on a domestic issue and I will fully greatly appreciate your help because I am at my wit ends. If there‚Äôs any lawyers / policy makers that are knowledgeable about the system, I hope you can leave a comment or a word of advice.

Context: I am Male of aged 19 and serving my national service, so I do not have a lot of time to handle it. Both my parents are in the household and I have a brother.

So the problem is that my brother has been greatly addicted to psychiatric medication, since 2016 and he overdoses frequently and often stay in his room and close his door. He has many medication, 2 stimulants, around 3 anti depressants, 5 for social anxiety and a lot more, I really get confused by all the name. He has schizophrenia, ADHD, OCD, depression. For me, I am also diagnosed with ADHD when I was 16, studying for my O levels. Back then, all these medications and psychiatric conditions are very new to me. When I tried taking Ritalin (stimulant), I felt it made me really easily agitated and irritated, so I stopped. Even though I find it extremely difficult to focus in class and often find myself in trouble with the disciplinary master, I managed to get by. However, I left my medications around and my brother also complained of the inability to focus. Since Ritalin is prescribed to treat ADHD people for their inability to focus, my brother decided to try some. And initially, it allowed him to focus more so he started taking more and more medications to the points he was aggressive and started developing psychosis episode. During my O-level period, when I was within the one month phase where I was taking O levels, he developed the worse psychosis episode so far and my safety was threatened, and so I called the police before I sat for one of my papers. The police did not take action and gave him a firm warning.

Since then, his psychosis started manifesting into many other psychiatric conditions because the symptoms overlap greatly. After being diagnosed with many other psychiatric conditions, he started taking many medications to treat each of his condition. And even so, there may be times he overdosed and he threatened the safety of my parents with a pen knife, so he had to be admitted to IMH. However, what I am worried about is that IMH discharged him, because they do not deal with a case of overdosage on stimulants, and all these medications that were initially prescribed to him were by a private psychiatrist, who willingly prescribed him any medication. He has a big room because he always complained that he is too untidy and needed more space but his whole room is filled with piles and piles of online anecdotal and scientific information about all the psychiatric medications. So when he go to the psychiatrist, the psychiatrist overly prescribed him because he wants to earn money. (Not saying all big generally that‚Äôs the case) And after painfully and blood sweatingly explaining your him that the private psychiatrist are sucking our money dry, he went to the psychiatrist to share his concerns about cutting down and the psychiatrist became sarcastic and said that my brother is crazy. So we decided to go to IMH A&amp;E clinic to get cheaper and more controlled medications.

However the problem is that he still keeps overdosing on medications and when we try to work with him to cut down, he will take coffee powder and eat it. Then he keeps complaining about us controlling his medications and say that he needs stability in his life. We have been going through this struggle for 4 years and it has really affected our family emotional state. And we have been patient, provided him family support, but he can‚Äôt cut it out completely. We sent him to NUH psychiatric ward and he got banned because of ‚Äúbad manners‚Äù. And we called the police on him because he pointed a pen knife at us and he got discharged later because he is above 21 and they do not take cases of stimulant addiction. And now, he is still taking too much medication. He complains we control too much, so if we give him 7 days of medication, he completes it in 4-5 days and try to last the 2-3 days without medication. And it is not healthy, and he becomes aggressive and the problem keeps going back and forth because we don‚Äôt see a light at the end of the tunnel. He is trying to go back to NTU but honestly, I think he will fail his course again and be academically banned from the school. But our main concern first is to really take these medications away from him. He always seem so pessimistic in life, and we have really did our best to tell him that life has a lot of sufferings and we shouldn‚Äôt use medications as a solution. But he keep acknowledging but still is unable to stave himself off the medication. We have tried psychotherapy too but he says some of them are either too uncomfortable, or too superstitious. And every time we ask him, when can we throw away some of the useless medications, he keep saying later and later and it has been delaying for 4 years already. I don‚Äôt see where this will end until we make a very bold and difficult move.

Any advice will be appreciated. We would really like to take the medications away from him. And even if we use police force or maybe forced to be tied to the bed to detoxify, we are really willing to go these extreme measures for him to stop taking these medications.

I do understand some of you may think medications are needed for him, but he is taking at such an uncontrolled rate that every time we don‚Äôt check in, he overdoses. Please advise, redditors.

During therapy, the therapist can also talk to the brother about why he is taking more than the prescribed dosage of medication. Understanding the function behind taking excessive doses might help to modify this maladaptive behaviour.']"

They then had one month school holiday after the June holidays were brought forward to May 5.\n\n&gt; The student from Hwa Chong Institution was last in school on April 7, before the start of full HBL.\n\n&gt; Of the other four cases, three were last in school on June 3, while one went to school on June 2, MOE said.\n\n&gt; Three of the five cases had onset of symptoms on June 3, while one began having symptoms on June 2 and the other, on May 31.\n\n&gt; MOE said all five were screened when entering their schools, and did not have a fever or visible flu-like symptoms.\n\n&gt; Contact tracing and investigations are currently ongoing.\n\n&gt; The students and staff who are on home quarantine will be swabbed for Covid-19 twice - once before the start of the quarantine and once at the end, said MOE.\n\n&gt; MOE said arrangements for all schools, including the five affected schools, remain unchanged.\n\n&gt; This means that for this coming week from Monday, Primary 1, 2, 3 and 6 students, as well as Secondary 3, 4 and 5 students will attend classes in school, while the remaining levels will be on Home-Based Learning, based on the earlier announced weekly rotation schedule.\n\n&gt; Graduating cohorts of Primary 6 and Secondary 4 and 5 attend classes in schools Mondays to Fridays.\n\n&gt; The rest rotate weekly between learning in school and learning at home.\n\n&gt; Last week, those in Primary 4 and 5 as well as those in Secondary 1 and 2 returned to school. They will be doing home-based learning (HBL) this week.\n\n&gt; The ministry noted that some of the students on LOA have registered for the Mother Tongue Language (MTL) examinations on June 18.\n\n&gt; As their LOA ends on June 17, they can still take the examination, it said, adding that the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board will apply special consideration during grading for these students. The students can also opt to take the year-end MTL examinations instead.\n\n&gt; In its statement, MOE said the schools have implemented a set of comprehensive safe management measures to bring students back in a careful and safe manner.\n\n&gt; ""Nevertheless, it is extremely important that each of us exercises personal responsibility. We would like to remind all parents, staff and students that if a student or any family member is unwell, the student should not go to school,"" it said.\n\n&gt; The ministry also gave the assurance that while it expects to see such confirmed cases from time to time, those at risk of being infected will be quickly isolated to prevent the virus from spreading and allow schools to continue.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"
104,singapore,239955,Serving NS with mental health struggles - what I learnt,gxr5kz,user_terminal,1591450733,53,1,"Some brief background about me: I am a 19yo currently serving NS. I entered NS with a PES B1 status but struggled with anxiety issues for a while and have been seing a psychiatrist, from whom I received a memo just in case of any issues in camp. Told my platoon commander about it and after discussion I decided to carry on with the basic training as my symptoms had been in remission for a while.

I decided that the probability of me entering into a frontline vocation that might worsen my mental health condition was significant, and also felt some recurrence of anxiety midway through the training, so I decided to hand my memo over to the doctor in the medical centre. Placed on light duty until training was disrupted by Covid, and now awaiting posting to a non-frontline vocation.

I wrote this post because I just wanted to share my experiences and encourage those who are currently in NS and struggling with past or current mental health conditions. Ok so here goes:

Most people weren't hostile to me, they just didn't understand.

So the response of most of my platoonmates after I went to the medical centre went along the lines of ""you look fine, I didn't know you had this problem"". Thankfully I didn't receive any verbal abuse from anyone in my platoon, they are all great people with whom I shared great memories with. Nonetheless, some probably didn't know how to react knowing my condition, and may have some preconceived mindset of people with mental health conditions being ""violent, unpredictable and dangerous"" and so interacted with me far less than before. I totally understand why they did that and don't blame them at all. But hopefully through my actions of kindness I can change their perception of people with mental health struggles.

Some people gave well-intentioned advice but it did get on my nerves after a while.

I heard from my family members constant advice not to report my condition in NS, in case a downgraded PES status affects my job prospects in future. Definitely, that has to be considered for those considering working in the civil service, but for me, such advice was often given with the implicit statement that my mental health issues are somehow not as real or as damaging as a physical condition. Which honestly made me rather irritated. But maybe I'm just reading too much into it. But anyways, my advice would be to always prioritise health over wealth. Those who have suffered from mental health issues know how awful the experience can be during the darkest moments.

I think some people looked down on me because of my condition, but I won't let that bother me.

Especially some of the sirs and sergeants, who have this mentality that being a ""man"" means having big muscles and being aggressive and brave. To them, having anxiety issues is a weakness. In response, I quote a character from my favourite fictional show: ""if you know pain and hardship, it's easier to be kind to others. It is different from weakness"". A true ""man"" (or ""woman"") is one who can show kindness to others. And for us who have struggled with mental health issues, we have developed a bravery and resilience of a different sort, and I would say, a better sort than the gung-ho heroism of some men. Because while we are resilient in the face of our own struggles, we learn how to be kind to others, as we know that a smiling face can hide many personal struggles and battles. ""Be kind to others, as everyone is fighting his own battles""

And also, there are certainly many healthy people who use mental health issues as a means to ""chao keng"", and this gives us a bad name. But I don't let that affect me. People can think whatever they want about me. Definitely I want to find people who can understand and emphatise with my situation, but I'm not going around begging for sympathy. And I won't let some people's harsh comments affect me.

I expect this post to get some nasty comments. To my brothers in NS who have also struggled, or are struggling with, mental health conditions, my advice for you would be to throw such comments out of the window. And to those who are afraid of declaring their conditions, my advice is to always protect your health, even if it means ""losing face"". Because if you lose your health, you lose everything. Do what you deem best for yourself.

I'm thinking something like randomly test people in the community, e.g. who are going to MRT, entering markets etc.

Pros: It's good forward surveillance that overcomes some issues with testing only patients with respiratory symptoms (depends on their willingness to report sick in the first place). If the prevalence is indeed as low as the current rates suggest, we can use pooled testing to make sure it's not even that big a drain on resources (e.g. if 10 pooled samples return negative, we can clear them all. and it's likely we will get mostly pooled negatives given the low rate of community cases)

109,singapore,255301,What to do about inconsiderate (?) people who don‚Äôt wear masks?,i14g67,specornot210,1596187006,8,1,"Hey all, 

Some background first: recently I have been going back to teach my primary school cousin tuition at my aunty‚Äôs house. The thing is, because we live in the same HDB block with several other family members, sometimes they would just come over to my aunty‚Äôs house to hang out. 

I have this other partially autistic cousin (who‚Äôs about 40+ years old) who understandably almost completely lacks social awareness. He doesn‚Äôt want to wear a mask. Any attempts to make him wear a mask or cover his mouth causes him to react aggressively. My aunties have resorted to just barely acknowledging his existence as he constantly badgers anyone non stop who pays him attention (like looking through your stuff/ asking rly inane questions for hours). My aunty normally just lets him in to her house for him to read the papers etc. she tried locking him out before but he would persistently bang the doors and shout a lot until she responded. 

I don‚Äôt think they want to commit him into IMH because they still see him as family. But still it‚Äôs pretty troubling.

The main point though is that this guy has been coughing non stop for the past month or 2. Recently, like the past 2-3 weeks, he comes to my aunty‚Äôs house a lot and just coughs like a fish out of water, attempts again to ask him to cover his mouth or wear a mask are useless. Yet he comes and coughs and coughs like as though he swallowed thorns or sth, my aunties have resorted to just staying away from him when he coughs. 

So here‚Äôs the problem: It‚Äôs quite scary because he doesn‚Äôt wear a mask, so I‚Äôm not sure if he does so when he walks around etc. (probably not Lel) so idk if he has actually caught Covid yet only possesses the milder symptoms. If so my entire aunty‚Äôs family and myself are at risk. 

Yet again because he‚Äôs autistic I‚Äôm not sure if he can be held responsible or accountable for such behaviour. Additionally, any attempt apart from coercive action would seem to fail. 

I haven‚Äôt developed any covid symptoms despite teaching my primary school cousin for about a month(?) yet I‚Äôm concerned for my aunties and kiddo cousin.

I've had a cough for the last week, no big deal, its not covid-19 nor do I have any other symptoms. My mother went to the pharmacy and got smooth talked into buying a $20 bottle of expectorant (cough medicine that thins out the mucus, helping you to cough it up) because the pharmacist told her its ""very good"". Its behind the counter medication which requires you to show the pharmacist your IC.

Now, shes under the impression that beacuse she had to show her IC when buying it, it is the good stuff and will cure the cough in no time.

I tried to explain that the stuff behind the counter is behind the counter to prevent people from overusing them, and does not necessarily mean that they are ""very good"" and will cure you quickly.

She started shouting ""don't argue, the pharmacist recommended it, i had to use my IC to buy it, it is very good, you won't die if you drink it"".

I also tried to explain that the expectorant wont ""cure"" the cough because thats not how it works, and that there are different types of coughs that it might not be suitable for, but you can imagine how that went.

All I tried to do was correct the misunderstanding she had, and she reacted badly because she won't accept the possibility that she might be wrong.

The double irony? Just last night, she was telling me all kinds of TCM things that had no scientific basis, like how eating chicken is bad for coughs but now shes praising the pharmacist (western medication) for smooth talking her into buying a $20 bottle of cough medicine which might not be even appropriate.

112,singapore,250836,Looking for Psychiatric Inpatient Recommendation (yes another mental health post),hqc8oz,elaborateruser,1594632614,14,1,"best option for inpatient? specifically asking for inpatient treatment because my insurance plan covers outpatient to a small limit and I've already hit that, while inpatient is up to 10k+. Am thinking of making use of it. Also kind of in a rush since my plan is ending this month, so I thought A&amp;E would be ideal because most hospitals ive called said their next available appt is in August earliest.

However I've seen and heard too many bad reviews about IMH inpatient, so I'm thinking NUH or other hospitals instead. Considering private ones as well. Just called NUH and they gave me an appointment in September so fuck that, and don't allow walk-ins/A&amp;E for psychiatric purposes either according to the person on the line (although I could still pull the ""I'm suicidal"" to oblige them to give me proper and prompt treatment).

Don't bother recommending KTPH even though its the nearest one near me, I just called and even after waiting half an hour on the line no one answered. They also once rejected my polyclinic referral (ISN""T THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF A REFERRAL???!!) I have no idea what they're doing, and even my private psych, who's relatively accomplished in his specialty and has even worked there before, specifically mentioned to avoid KTPH for psychiatric treatment too lol. He also did recommend CGH but it's a bit far for me, but if anyone has experience there do let me know.

Also for additional info I don't have a specific condition, I have a little bit of this and that (i.e. mostly Anxiety but with depressive symptoms and possibly Bipolar as well) with ADHD as an identified underlying cause. 

I do have a diagnosis and memo from a private psych ive been seeing prior to hitting my insurance plan limit. He recommended IMH but I didn't ask about inpatient. I'm sure IMH's outpatient can't be that bad since I just need my meds, even if I meet a shitty doc, they're still obligated to prescribe my meds and thats all I need. So I'll go IMH for long term outpatient treatment but from what I gather, definitely not inpatient.

**TLDR: looking for inpatient psychiatric recommendations that ISN'T IMH or KTPH. Anyone who has stayed at more than 1 inpatient hospital (for comparison), I would appreciate your input.  Thanks.**

Dear Prime Minister Mr Lee Hsien Loong,
 
The objective of this article is to highlight the incompetency in handling the COVID-19 by your team of leaders. The word, ‚Äúleaders‚Äù in this article is referring to your consultants, parliament members, ministers and yourself involved in the handling of the COVID-19 situation in Singapore.

Firstly, the initial message given to the public: 
‚ÄúDO NOT WEAR A MASK IF YOU ARE WELL‚Äù ‚Äì this is an absolute no brainer statement made.

Please refer to the MOH link dated 29 Jan 2020, for evidence 
https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/2019-ncov/english_advisory-on-wearing-masks.pdf

Please refer to the MOH link dated 4 Feb 2020 V3, for evidence
https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/practise-good-personal-hygiene---english-(05-feb).pdf

I am an average common man. Through my friends in China, I came to know that wearing a mask is critical to protect ourselves from this disease. At that time, it is already known that the virus can be spread to another person before the infected person realises that they have the virus. 

Please refer to the MOH Link dated 3 Feb 2020, Read point 20.
https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/ministerial-statement-on-whole-of-government-response-to-the-2019-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)

Even though this form of transmission is uncommon according to MOH, what did the government do to mitigate the threat effectively.

The government advised its citizens to wear a mask only if they were displaying symptoms associated with Covid-19. Rather than to make it mandatory for the whole population, only a weak advice was given. Many people do not heed this advice whether it be due to a lack of masks ‚Äìmost masks were obtained via personal expenses at the time- or due to other reasons. With many individuals not heeding this advice, the rampant spread of Covid-19 occurred. Masks were only made mandatory for all on the 14th of April as announced by Minister for national Development, Mr Lawrence Wong. Due to the delay in implementing a strict regulation of wearing masks in public, the number of cases had seen a spike from 596 cases on the 19th of April to 1426 on the 20th of April. According to World Health Organisation (WHO) most Covid-19 cases have an average of 5-6 days before the onset of symptoms with the longest being up to 14 days. The delay in implementing mandatory usage of masks in the public has led to such a rampant spread in the Covid-19. How could the leaders lack such common sense that the lack of mask usage would lead to the spread of the virus. 

With my little common sense, I made arrangements and shipped in surgical masks from Portugal and N95 masks from USA. I started to receive the masks on 17 February onwards.

I gave the surgical and N95 mask to my parents and asked them to use it together with hand sanitisers. My sister and myself also lectured to my parents on the importance of using face masks and hand sanitiser along with frequent hand washing. Both my parents work together and live together.

My parents have their own shop in Singapore shopping centre. I even told my father in early march to close his shop until the situation gets better.

My mother took my advice and religiously used the face mask along with hand sanitisers. However, my father trusted our governments stand on ‚ÄúDo not wear a mask if you are well‚Äù. Almost every week I met him and told him to use the facemask but he kept telling me that he is well and so there was no need to wear it. At times, he just wore it to please me in my presence and once I left the shop, he would remove it. 

Unfortunately, my father started feeling unwell on 5 April 2020. From 5 April, my father started to wear a mask. He followed the government advise. On the 6 April he consulted the Doctor for his fever. There was no other symptoms. Doctor suspected he is likely to have normal flu. The fever didn‚Äôt stop even with medication, so on 7 April, my mother brough my father to the same doctor. Again, there was no other symptoms expect the fever. The doctor told my parents to monitor closely. Later in the afternoon he developed very high fever, above 39 degrees Celsius. My mother immediately brought him to TTSH A&amp;E. From the X Ray report there was a slight inflammation in the lungs, and was admitted for pneumonia in TTSH. On 8 April morning about 5 am, I received a call from the hospital, ‚ÄúMy father is COVID-19 positive, and he is transferred to NCID‚Äù. There he succumbed to COVID-19 on the 27 April 2020.

If the PAP government have not made such an incompetent statement ‚ÄúDO NOT WEAR A MASK IF YOU ARE WELL‚Äù, may be my father is alive today.

If my father did not trust the PAP government advice on this matter, may be he is alive today.

The last words from my father before he when into the ventilator
To my mother ‚ÄúIt is better to die‚Äù
When I called to find out why he said that. He told me ‚ÄúHe cannot take it. It is causing him a lot of discomfort and suffering‚Äù

His suffering is still haunting me.

Another, critical area of incompetency was in Feb 2020, we all are aware about the 5 Bangladesh workers from Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site were infected with COVID-19. 

Don‚Äôt your leaders know these workers might go to Mustafa Centre?
Don‚Äôt your leaders know they live in overcrowded communal living spaces?
Don‚Äôt your leaders know they socialise on Sundays in densely populated are with fellow workers from different living space across the island?
Don‚Äôt your leaders know this will link to many living spaces across our country?

As a common man, I could only list the above few. I am sure many more details have to be mitigated to prevent a disaster.

What was the immediate action taken to mitigate the disaster we are in now? If your leaders responsibly mitigated every element of threat seriously, we wouldn‚Äôt be in this situation now. Maybe my father is alive now. Next to Singapore Shopping centre where my father has a shop is the 9 Penang lane cluster. 

Please refer to the MOH Link dated 12 April 2020, for evidence.
https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/32-more-cases-discharged-233-new-cases-of-covid-19-infection-confirmed

Please refer to the MOH Link, showing case 1647 was confirm on 8 April 2020.
https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annex9-4.pdf

Many of construction workers patronise my father‚Äôs shop for drinks and snacks. My mother who works with my father told me, many of the workers bought lots of paracetamol on the last 1 week of his business. Hence, I highly suspect my father would have contracted it from one of them. Although our incompetent team still have not established a link to my father in its website.

Please refer to the MOH Link, showing case #1595, which is my fathers, still showing blank for link.
https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annex---summary-of-confirmed-cases---8apr2020.pdf

Key points:
1. if the PAP government have not made an incompetent statement ‚ÄúDO NOT WEAR A MASK IF YOU ARE WELL‚Äù
2. address the first few cases of Bangladeshi workers seriously in detail and mitigate all treats.

If the COVID-19 situation was handled with competency right from day one, we would not have to waste $93 billion. This is the citizens hard-earned money.

Please refer to the link for the amount of Singaporean money wasted.
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/fortitude-budget-covid-19-parliament-passes-heng-swee-keat-12808172

It clearly shows, some of the leaders in the PAP government are incompetent in handling the COVID-19 situation. Which leads more than 43,000 people infected, and cost the public a lot of pain, stress as well as $93 billion lost to cushion the damage caused by the rampant spread of Covid-19 to the nation. I am not saying you could have saved it all, but you could have made the situation a lot better and spent much less if you had done the right thing with foresight.

In a private sector, if someone made an irrevocable mistake that leads to a few billion dollars lost, he or she would have been fired immediately. In the army, if an officer made a terrible mistake, he or she would be sacked or reprimanded and when the contract term ends, he or she will not be re-contracted.

Why can the following countries do better?
Hong Kong
Taiwan
New Zealand
Are their leader betters than ours?

Where is the accountability and ownership among our leaders? Was anyone responsible fired or asked to step down? 

I am not expecting a response to this article. I just hope you can employ the best person for the job. So that our country will not suffer from such situations again. There will be other challenges in the future for which we will need the best leaders in the world.

I have had the misfortune of working under tyrant bosses. Every position that I have landed into so far in my 2.5 years of working is actually a ‚Äòhot‚Äô seat - high turnover. 

I think I am spiraling into depression where self-doubt, anxiety, stress, fear are my best friends already. I am really not ok. 

Not sure if you can see it but here was what I had described [job situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ik7p59/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/g3ly7r4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

TLDR: My mental health is suffering. Physical symptoms show. I experience dread and nausea just thinking about work. Working from home is bad enough but when I actually have to report back to office (where its just my boss and I in office)... holy shit the fear is real. I know I wont stay long in my current position (definitely before end of 2020)  but everyday feels like a torture. My boss sorta knows my intention to leave too. 

But it is covid-19 pandemic we live in. Everyone is trying to save jobs.... people I talk to tell me not to quit. Because it is practical. 

At this stage, I have a verbal offer from a Ministry but as you know, they take a hell of a long time (this Ministry took 3 months to call me for interview). Some people tell me verbal offers dont count. I also have a few interviews that I am awaiting the results for... 
To some people, the above accounts for naught. But to me, they are symbols of hope. 

For myself, my savings are sufficient to tide me through 6-8 months. But what strikes me is the uncertainty and the stigma that comes with unemployment.

Overall global statistics death rate is 2 to 3% but most are elderly and sick with complications already. The true death rate may be much lower due to the fact a lot who are infected did not report due to no or mild symptoms.

Sweden did not lock down their economy and so far their curve is flattening.

Here's the story:

Basically my father was the ""victim"" of this pandemic. In addition to this, he recently had a relapse in his cancer condition which cause his immune system to weaken with the addition of chemotherapy and all.
My father was in close contact with his friend (COVID-19 positive) as they met up to exercise together in an open area (i shall not state where) on Saturday (08/08). The thing is his friend fetched his wife who was feeling unwell in the afternoon and she was tested positive. So, he had asked the doctor to send him for testing and turned out positive. However, my dad was only informed by the health officials he was a close contact after 2 whole days (basically Monday) and told him to effectively start quarantining and stay at home until officials come in person to decide whether they need to move him to a facility (which could arrive ""anytime""). What was worse, the officials who called my dad do not have a definite answer on how to handle cancer relapse patients like him if he were to be sent to a quarantine facility (we have a maid here to take care of the daily basic necessities at home). To add on to my frustration, they called today and told my dad that they will not send officials over and probably will not do swabbing. In addition to that, they told us that only my dad needs quarantine. The rest of us immediate household members can do whatever we want and go out whenever we want. They will only do a video call with my dad later in the day to check on him.

There are many things that ticks me off:

Why does his friend did not tell my father about his/his wife's positive testing?

Why the officials took 2 whole days to finally trace back to my dad as his close contact?

Why can't the officials just conduct swabbing now and at the end of 14 days of SHN?

Why are the officials slacking on the pandemic by not physically sending people over to see if my dad can be quarantined at home effectively?

Why does testing have to only be done on people who display symptoms? There are asymptomatic cases out there too.

Will the officials take full responsibility for being incompetent in informing us and not upholding the measures to ensure our health and well-being?

Are these many of the few things that many other countries see us as the ""gold standard"" for? Is economy more important than a pandemic right now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/i7msl0/how_the_officials_handle_potential_covid19/,1.0,"['for all the big questions at the end, this could have just been simply avoided by the dad managing the risk better by reducing contact with others, especially with his condition']"

121,singapore,266995,A story of a cancer ridden NSF. Journey from PES A to PES F.,it7khs,LGFBOOM,1600172135,282,1,"Hi all,

I've been told by many to share my highly peculiar and unusual story, so here I am doing so. 

I returned to Singapore from studying overseas in September 2019 a month before my enlistment. I met up with old friends, picked up a temp job as a packer to pass time and earn a little bit of extra cash before entering my new journey in NS. 

October 8th 2019: Today, I enlist in the Singapore Police Force at the Home Team Academy. My parents flew to Singapore to witness my right of passage from an ""Ah Boy"" to a ""Man"". A few days before entering camp I developed possibly one of the worst coughs I've ever had and thought to myself; 

""You can't go to the MO on your first week you'll look like a chao keng warrior"" 

Despite the bad cough, I was genuinely enjoying my time in the Police Officer Basic Course (SPF's BMT). I made good friends whom I hung out with on the week-ends and volunteered for positions in camp. Physically, I was doing the best I could as I wanted to reach my goal of an IPPT score of 95. My first IPPT I was handed a score of 84 with which I was content but wanted to improve on. 

As weeks went by, I decided it was now ok to go to the MO and get treated for my cough. I was given some basic medications to treat coughs. Thankfully, those medications did help to bring the symptoms down and I was feeling a hell of a lot better. That was around the time I took my 2nd IPPT and improved to 91. I mention these IPPT scores not to show off but to show you how unexpected a sickness may arrive, even when you think you are in the pink of health. 

Mid-November: I notice a lump in my neck!

While having swimming lessons at HTA, which by the way, honestly is a beautiful camp, I felt slight discomfort while doing different types of strokes. I felt my neck and realised there was a large lump. I didn't think much of it, and assumed it was my lymph nodes swelling up because of my cough. A few days after that discovery, the antibiotics and cough syrup I received started to wear off and my cough came back in full force. I went to the MO once again, but this time mentioned my inflated Lymph Nodes. I was given another round of antibiotics and was told; if the lymph nodes don't swell down come back. 

A Christmas surprise: My lymph nodes never decreased in size. 

We were lucky enough to receive a few days Block leave to celebrate Christmas and the New Year's. I quickly flew back to KL to see my friends and family. Despite having an amazing time there, the fact that my lymph nodes kept increasing in size was keeping me from fully enjoying myself. My flight back to SG was on a Sunday morning and I had to report back to camp by Sunday evening. As soon as I landed, I went to the nearest clinic right before closing time. The doctor took down my symptoms and told me he suspected there was a slight chance this might be Tuberculosis which itself carries a 6 month treatment plan. He gave me a few days MC and referred me to Polyclinic to get an x-ray. By the way, big-ups to the Singapore Public health care system; it's truly out of this world. Anyways, the x-ray came back inconclusive so, I was sent to Changi General Hospital for an MRI on the 31st of December and this is where things took a turn towards the dark. The doctor came back with the results and mentioned it might be tuberculosis, or it might be a cancer of the lymph nodes. My face went pale, and immediately felt the need to cry. We were not sure of it yet, so I told myself; I'm 18, fit and healthy. There is no way in hell I have cancer. To confirm doctor's suspicions, I was sent to SGH where I met, in my opinion the world's best oncologist. There, they suggested I did a biopsy (small procedure on my neck to remove a lymph node) and a PET-Scan (heavily prevalent scan to detect cancer growth over time). 

January 10th brought my life's most devastating news yet: I was alone. I went to see my Oncologist to get my results. My parents had important things to attend to overseas and were instead with me on the phone during the meeting. My doctor asked my parents to fly down and I assumed the worst. She wanted my parents to be here with my while she announces the news but I couldn't handle the wait and asked her bluntly; did I have cancer, yes or no.

122,singapore,277290,A story of a cancer ridden NSF. Journey from PES A to PES F.,jk2tp3,LGFBOOM,1603942253,144,1,"\[REPOST\] - I am now officially discharged from NS and am in a better position to share my story. Thank you to everyone who sent kind and thoughtful messages when I first posted. Much love &lt;3

Hi all,

I've been told by many to share my highly peculiar and unusual story, so here I am doing so.

I returned to Singapore from studying overseas in September 2019 a month before my enlistment. I met up with old friends, picked up a temp job as a packer to pass time and earn a little bit of extra cash before entering my new journey in NS.

October 8th 2019: Today, I enlist in the Singapore Police Force at the Home Team Academy. My parents flew to Singapore to witness my rite of passage from an ""Ah Boy"" to a ""Man"". A few days before entering camp I developed possibly the worst cough and thought to myself;

""You can't go to the MO on your first week you'll look like a chao keng warrior""

Despite the bad cough, I was genuinely enjoying my time in the Police Officer Basic Course (SPF's BMT). I made good friends whom I hung out with on the week-ends and volunteered for positions in camp. Physically, I was doing the best I could as I wanted to reach my goal of an IPPT score of 95. My first IPPT I was handed a score of 84 with which I was content but wanted to improve on.

As weeks went by, I decided it was now ok to go to the MO and get treated for my cough (it had started getting better by itself prior to that so didn‚Äôt see the urgency). I was given some basic medications to treat coughs. Thankfully, those medications did help to bring the symptoms down and I was feeling a hell of a lot better. That was around the time I took my 2nd IPPT and improved to 91. I mention these IPPT scores not to show off but to show you how unexpected a sickness may arrive, even when you think you are in the pink of health.

Mid-November: I notice a lump in my neck!

While having swimming lessons at HTA, which by the way, honestly is a beautiful camp, I felt slight discomfort while doing different types of strokes. I felt my neck and realised there was a large lump. I didn't think much of it, and assumed it was my lymph nodes swelling up because of my cough. A few days after that discovery, the antibiotics and cough syrup I received started to wear off and my cough came back in full force. I went to the MO once again, but this time mentioned my inflated Lymph Nodes. I was given another round of antibiotics and was told; if the lymph nodes don't swell down come back.

A Christmas surprise: My lymph nodes never decreased in size.

We were lucky enough to receive a few days Block leave to celebrate Christmas and the New Year's. I quickly flew back to KL to see my friends and family. Despite having an amazing time there, the fact that my lymph nodes kept increasing in size was keeping me from fully enjoying myself. My flight back to SG was on a Sunday morning and I had to report back to camp by Sunday evening. As soon as I landed, I went to the nearest clinic right before closing time. The doctor took down my symptoms and told me he suspected there was a slight chance this might be Tuberculosis which itself carries a 6 month treatment plan. He gave me a few days MC and referred me to Polyclinic to get an x-ray. By the way, big-ups to the Singapore Public health care system; it's truly out of this world. Anyways, the x-ray came back inconclusive so, I was sent to Changi General Hospital for an MRI on the 31st of December and this is where things took a turn towards the dark. The doctor came back with the results and mentioned it might be tuberculosis, or it might be a cancer of the lymph nodes. My face went pale, and immediately felt the need to cry. We were not sure of it yet, so I told myself; I'm 18, fit and healthy. There is no way in hell I have cancer. To confirm doctor's suspicions, I was sent to SGH where I met, in my opinion the world's best oncologist. There, they suggested I did a biopsy (small procedure on my neck to remove a lymph node) and a PET-Scan (heavily prevalent scan to detect cancer growth over time).

January 10th brought my life's most devastating news yet: I was alone. I went to see my Oncologist to get my results. My parents had important things to attend to overseas and were instead with me on the phone during the meeting. My doctor asked my parents to fly down and I assumed the worst. She wanted my parents to be here with my while she announces the news but I couldn't handle the wait and asked her bluntly; did I have cancer, yes or no. She nodded sympathetically, and my whole life flashed before my eyes. I felt like breaking down. I cannot find words intense enough to describe the absolutely horrid feeling of someone informing you that you are cancer ridden, let alone at the young age of 18.

123,singapore,276864,So next phase of border opening? Moh update as of 27th,jj0p66,acvon,1603803804,6,1,"27TH OCT 2020

                  The Multi-Ministry Taskforce regularly reviews our border measures to manage the risk of importation and onward local transmission from travellers. Given the surveillance regime that we have put in place for travellers serving Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at their own residence, we will also adopt a risk-based approach and allow more travellers to serve their 14-day SHN at a suitable place of residence. From 1 January 2021, all incoming travellers will also be required to pay for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities, and will be responsible for their inpatient medical bills if they have onset of symptoms of COVID-19 within 14 days of their entry to Singapore.

More Travellers Allowed to Serve 14-Day SHN at Suitable Place of Residence

2.               Currently, except for countries that we have unilaterally opened up to, travellers from selected low risk countries/ regions serve a 7-day SHN at their place of residence or suitable accommodation of their choice, and all other travellers serve a 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities.

3.               Since 11 August 2020, all travellers serving SHN outside of dedicated SHN facilities are required to don an electronic monitoring device throughout their SHN. This complements agencies‚Äô checks to ensure compliance with the SHN. With the enhanced surveillance regime in place, we will also adopt a risk-based approach and allow more travellers from Estonia, Fiji, Finland, Japan, Norway, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey[1] to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence, if they fulfil the following criteria:

         a.     Travelled to no other country than above-mentioned countries, in the last consecutive 14 days prior to entry; and

         b.     Are occupying their place of residence (i.e. residential address) alone, or only with household members who are also persons serving SHN with the same travel history and duration of SHN.

4.               Travellers from the abovementioned countries may apply to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities from 2 November 2020, for arrivals on or after 4 November 2020. For Singapore Citizens (SCs) and Permanent Residents (PRs), the application must be made prior to arrival via the Safe Travel Office website. Travellers who are not SCs or PRs may apply to opt out as part of the entry approval process. All travellers must present the approval to opt out upon arrival in Singapore. As the list of countries will be updated from time to time depending on the public health risk assessment, all travellers must be prepared to be subject to the prevailing border measures upon entry, including stay in dedicated SHN facilities and payment, where applicable.

5.               All travellers who opt to stay at their place of residence for SHN must remain in their declared place of residence at all times. They will be subject to close monitoring of their whereabouts, through electronic monitoring as well as physical spot-checks. Strict enforcement action will be taken against those who breach the requirements of the SHN or make false declarations. Such persons will also be required to utilise specially designated transport services from the checkpoint to their place of residence and to their respective testing facilities, and bear the costs[2] for these transport arrangements.

All Travellers to Bear Costs of Stay at Dedicated SHN Facilities and COVID-19 Treatment

6.               The Government has thus far borne the costs of stay at dedicated SHN facilities and medical bills for COVID-19 treatment for SCs and PRs who last left Singapore before 27 March 2020. The Government has also borne the costs of COVID-19 medical bills for new SCs/ PRs/ Long-Term Pass Holders (LTPHs), and existing LTPHs who departed Singapore before 27 March 2020. All other incoming travellers have had to pay for these costs as part of their private expenses, subject to the applicable healthcare arrangements for their bills[3].

7.               Stay in self-isolation facilities is now a widely-accepted requirement of international travel in a COVID-19 world. The vast majority of SCs and PRs who last left Singapore within the past year have returned. Hence with effect from 1 January 2021, we will no longer waive the costs of stay at dedicated SHN facilities for SCs and PRs who last left Singapore before 27 March 2020.

 8.               Similarly, with effect from 1 January 2021, all returning SC/ PR/ LTPH travellers who last left Singapore before 27 March 2020, as well as new SCs/ PRs/ LTPHs will also be responsible for their inpatient medical bills, should they develop onset of symptoms within 14 days of their arrival in Singapore, but they will be able to tap on regular healthcare financial arrangements for their inpatient medical bills ‚Äì SCs and PRs may access Government subsidies and MediShield Life / Integrated Shield Plan to help pay for their bills, while LTPHs may tap on their usual financing arrangements, such as private insurance.

Regular Review of Border Measures

9.               Singapore‚Äôs border measures will evolve as the global situation changes. We will continue to monitor the global health situation closely and update our border measures in accordance with the public health risk assessment. If the situation in a country/region deteriorates, more stringent measures will be put in place to limit the risk of importation and prevent community transmission from imported cases.

He's fallen sick before (the usual fever/runny nose/cough) but usually bounces back real quick within a day or two of the symptoms first appearing.

However Friday morning he suddenly woke up with a 39.x degree fever. Though he was still pretty much his usual energetic self, his energy faded by mid-morning as the fever raged on without much abatement, staying withing the 38.5-39.5 degree range. After his afternoon nap it hit an all-time high of 39.9 degrees, which is when we decided to take him to the PD, who inserted a suppository (ouch) which was pretty effective and his temperature returned to normal by early evening.

... Till about 1030pm when he woke up crying and we found his fever had returned with a vengeance. To cut the story of a very long night short, we've been feeding him paracetamol / ibuprofen every alternate 3 hours and also sponging him when he gets too hot, and encouraging him to take fluids orally too.

So anyway, it's almost Saturday noon now snd his fever has been ding donging from 38-39.5 degrees still. My wife talked about bringing him to KK, but from what I heard from parent friends, there won't be much they can do additional to treat his symptoms (I suppose they'll make him take a covid snd dengue test...).

Any advice from parents here who have experienced this before with their kids? I know this is quite common (especially since my kid has started going to childcare since August), but I'd like to hear if anyone has suggestions on how I can make the poor boy feel better. Hearing him cry with such frustration and pain in his young voice kinda broke my heart a little last night.

From past experience (I‚Äôve been warded around 15 times in IMH), it is not a pleasant place to be in.

So, you understand why I wouldn‚Äôt want to go there right? But I did anyway, because they were my lifeline and I‚Äôve got nothing else to save me from my grief and suicidal ideation. 

One of the days in ward 22B, I felt the uncontrollable anger rising and after trying to contain it and failed, I approached the Staff Nurse and said 

Me: I‚Äôm not feeling quite well, I feel very angry 

Her: then what you want me to do? *sarcastic tone*

Me: Um... maybe you can give me my stand by medication? (Lorazepam to calm me down) 

Her: huh? You cannot wait ah? 7pm medication time, now only 6.30pm 

In my defence, my standby medication was to be taken anytime as needed. I didn‚Äôt need to wait till 7pm like she said. 

At this point, I was more enraged because of her response to me asking for help. I felt so helpless, hopeless and defeated because I was warded in a hospital that was supposed to ease my pain but they escalated it instead. 

I walked to the window and started punching the grills repeatedly. Nobody came to stop me, until one of the patients grabbed my hand and made me see that I was bleeding. They raised the alarm and 10 Nurses from other wards came to restrain me on the bed. They gave me an injection to make me sleep. 

Wouldn‚Äôt it have been easier if they just gave me my standby medication intended to help me by the doctor? 

Anyway, the next day the Nurses put me in a wheelchair and did not tell me WHERE I was going or WHY. They wheeled me off and I arrived at the C class ward. I later found out that they DID NOT call my parents to inform them that I have been transferred. 

I‚Äôve been here before and the conditions here are far worse than the B class ward. More patients, less Nurses, and people peeing and pooping on the floor and running around naked. 

I sat on the bed thinking 

1. They‚Äôre punishing me for showing symptoms of my disorder (even when I asked for help and was denied help) 
2. I feel incredibly abandoned 
3. I would rather be dead than be here 

If I was perceived as a danger or risk, wouldn‚Äôt it make sense to send me to the high dependency ward where there is more attention and observation given by Nurses and Doctors? 

After this, my mental state has become so severe that I dissociated. I was not in my body anymore. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt control my actions. 

I was told (I lost my memory) that I asked my parents to discharge me against medical advice, and the doctor made them sign a form and let me go. 

I don‚Äôt remember anything from that moment on except for a few flashes.

The one that stuck to me was me walking to the ledge without hesitation and climbed it. 

And then nothing. 

I woke up in the ICU and was told that I jumped off the 16th floor. 

I miraculously survived and I want to make a difference for both my late Best Friend, myself and everyone who is mentally ill and is forced to go to IMH. 

I am planning to sue IMH.

She visited a particular clinic for her knee pain 10 years ago and I suppose that‚Äôs when she got her sleeping and anxiety pills from that clinic ever since.

I did asked her why she need those pills and she said she can‚Äôt sleep. I told her she can‚Äôt sleep is bcos she is always on fb and YouTube and that she should try to stop messing with her sleep cycle. But she would always get defensive and insist it‚Äôs not the case. She can‚Äôt sleep even if she is not staring at her phone.

There was a few time when she asked me to get the pills on her behalf bcos she‚Äôs not feeling well. When I went there I asked the doc is taking those pills addictive and also how can she don‚Äôt take those pills or lessen the dosage? But the doc said ‚Äòno choice lor, she can‚Äôt sleep what.‚Äô

I mean like wtf? Is that all they can do? 

Recently went to polyclinic with my mum to take some blood pressure pills and I sounded out to the doctor there that she have been taking those pills for the last ten years. The doctor looked surprised and advised my mum not to take anymore as her hand will be shaky and when that happens there is no cure whatsoever.

Will she get any withdrawal symptoms? What will happen to her sleep cycle? Is there a way to reverse this and get her to be healthy and don‚Äôt rely on those pills again?

She is 69 this year. And she always use that as an excuse to just let her be as she at most will live for another 10-20 years. So just let her do whatever she wants.

140,singapore,191347,Punishment vs Rehabilitation,ddcmuo,Bryanlegend,1570219294,50,47,"I think there has been a lot of discussions on the recent cases involving university students who are guilty of sexual offences. It seems to me on this sub that most people are of the view that said offenders should have received harsher punishments and not be allowed mitigations based on their academic performances and other related factors.

It also appears that while most people here are supportive of more punitive responses to such crimes, almost none of us are concerned with the rehabilitation of such perpetrators or with the detrimental effects more punitive measures could have on their rehabilitation. It‚Äôs as if we have decided collectively as a society that these people are lepers that should be casted out and left to fend for themselves. It‚Äôs as if we have decided that these people are not worthy of any redemption. Basically, all we are saying is ‚Äúlet‚Äôs lock them up‚Äù without actually caring about ‚Äúwhat do we do about them next‚Äù. 

I can‚Äôt help but feel that the systematic way we treat and outcast people who commit such crimes is the reason why we have a culture where sexual crimes and misconduct are so perpetuated and normalised. In another thread, we see how there are telegram channels with thousand of members dedicated to voyeuristic contents, many of which involve children and teenagers. This is a worrying trend and I personally feel that this is a result of us avoiding the elephant in the room. Discussions about sex are usually considered taboo here in our culture and especially so for sexual crimes. We fear discussing issues like these so much, we have no choice but to compartmentalise it as something completely abhorrent. The only reasonable response to that for us would be to chuck them into a small corner away from our lives(both figuratively and literally), and avoid having to deal with them again. 

However, being outcasted with nowhere to go, people with sexual compulsions and tendencies have to resort to forming their own in-groups as a show of solidarity and to feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again. This might be a very warped sense of belonging but it is the only way for them to feel like a functional member of society amidst their dysfunction. 

I may be in a minority here, but I feel that whatever the case ruling, the judge had the best intention. There is always a fine line in balancing punishment and rehabilitation, and it being a zero sum game sometimes, giving more of rehabilitation means giving out less of the other. Too often, we fail to realise that perhaps such crimes are manifestations of underlying behavioural problems and that these people are more in need of help than of punishments.

Just to play the devil‚Äôs advocate, I‚Äôm actually wondering if in the case of sexual misconduct, would more jail time or caning(punitive) be a more effective response against let‚Äôs say, probation/counselling (rehabilitative) for the perpetrators. Because let‚Äôs face it, when we give them more jail time and harsher sentences, the less likely they are able to seek actual outside help on their compulsions. If we do not treat other addictions by just locking them up only and pretending that they no longer exist, why should we do the same for addictions of a sexual nature?

TLDR: We fear what we don‚Äôt understand, and we don‚Äôt understand what we don‚Äôt talk about. We don‚Äôt talk openly enough about sexual crimes and compulsions/addictions, and this is the reason why we are seeing worrying trends today.

I'm currently year 2, studying nursing in a polytechnic.
The past few attachments at the hospital has been a dreadful one. I wake up feeling dreadful and the thought of completing my attachment just makes me wanna kms. I love being in the Healthcare sector, in fact when i was young, I wanted to be a doctor/paramedic/surgeon. This is probably due to the loss of my father. Back then I just felt so useless, not being able to do anything or to recognize his deteriorating heart + his symptoms. Furthermore, my mom recently suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage and i just felt thr need to be in the Healthcare sector. But like most Singaporeans they can't be a doctor just because they dream of being one.

After O levels, I didnt know what course to enroll in. Nursing seems like the closest to any Healthcare related course so I just went to nursing. I originally had passion for nursing but now it's starting to fade. Apart from nursing, I was also keen in becoming a therapist (physio/occupational). I feel that treating a patient has 3 different phases. The treatment(doctor), caring(nurses) and rehabilitation (therapists) and I want to be a part of making the patient live as well as possible. 

I've checked online and apparently the only degree offering physiotherapy /occupational is SIT. I'm not sure about their requirements but the only thing I know is a science related diploma is which my nursing (health science) is.

**Tl;Dr... Currently in nursing (diploma) but I would like to switch to physiotherapy or occupational therapy. Need advice on getting a degree. 

1)does anyone know about the requirements to enter physio/occupational therapy in SIT? if anyone is curious about my GPA for year 1 it is 3.60

2) Are there any other places which offers such degrees? I'm not keen in overseas since they're probably expensive af and I'm not a rich man's son so probably can't afford it.

152,singapore,134842,What would a theoretical (running) zombie outbreak look like? - A written account,9hznmk,archerthegreat,1537622797,54,88,"Here's the scenario:

A previously dormant rabies-like infection has entered the country via several channels such as businessmen from foreign countries, ship crew on shore leave and returning citizens from other nations. They are quarantined at several hospitals such as Changi General, Tan Tock Seng and Raffles Hospital. Now take into consideration that these hospitals are generally located in the South and East areas.

A trigger event rapidly mutates the virus into sending the infected into a rabid state, focused on murdering the people in their vicinity. They are NOT dead - only sent into an unending and persistent rage aided by artificial metabolism in the host body. They retain the simplest of rudimentary knowledge and muscle memory like opening simple doors, using melee weapons and climbing stairs. Infected martial artists are the most dangerous as they maintain their ingrained skillset when overrunning the uninfected.

The Patient Zeros are dispatched quickly and restrained but many people who were attacked contracts the virus and themselves are quarantined but a few were able to evade and returned to their homes.

Previously, the Patient Zeros who urinated at the local toilets and had it flushed into the sewerage means that a small detachment of the virus made it into the NEWater supply and subsequently diluted into the tapwaters. This concentration of the virus was much less volatile and only infected those with very weak immune systems and even those take around 2 days of feverish symptoms and progression of dementia before completely turning.

Day 1 after Patient Zero deaths
------------------------------------
Several infected return to their homes, developing feverish symptoms. During this time the trigger event from before have caused the virus to rapidly evolve and decrease the time of transformation from 3 days to 24 hours and very soon, in a manner of minutes and seconds.

The news spreads out and goes viral on social media as this version of reality zombie lore still exists such as The Walking Dead, 28 Days Later and World War Z. Anxiety is high in Singapore and immediately a sharp decline in investment and economic activity is observed. Life goes on as usual but many survivalists begin to flee the country via outbound flights and the Tuas/Woodlands checkpoints.

Day 2-4
-------
Life goes on as per usual. Peak hour traffic, NSF bookins and crowded trains remain a sight. However those infected from the previous day refuse to come out of their bedrooms. When disturbed, they begin attacking the rest of their household, creating a ruckus and infecting several people in the vicinity. First responders are quickly dispatched to places like Clementi, Geylang Bahru, Bukit Panjang and Marine Parade. Once again, these incidents hits the headlines and the attacked victims were quickly transported to nearby hospitals. The Ministry of Health and NEA at this point have been engaged and are actively looking into the cases but are unknowingly walking into a trap as the virus mutates into its peak form, which transforms the infected within 20-45 seconds.

The Police Force are dispatched and murder the infected in the hospitals as they show no signs of cooperating or being incapacitated by conventional means. The news has spread far and wide on social media such as Facebook, Reddit, Snapchat, Instastory and news outlets that panic is beginning to spread in Singapore. To the average viewer, their neighbourhoods and immediate vicinity are still the same as before, but the gory images and recorded phone camera footage makes the hair on their skin stand.

Meanwhile, the SAF increases its threat level and begins to dispatch security troops to patrol major areas as the government begins to pick up on the viral threat. Many NSFs fail to report for their duties and have gone AWOL, most likely in anticipation of a widespread outbreak. Malaysian Immigration authorities begin to show concern over the high traffic across the two checkpoints.

Day 5-7
---------
Thousands of unlucky victims to the tapwater contamination succumb to the infection, rapidly spawning infected across the entire country, mainly Boon Lay, Yishun, Bukit Panjang, Bukit Timah, Tuas, Marine Parade, Serangoon, Sengkang and Pasir Ris. These infected begin to terrorize neighborhoods but the density is still too thin in order to cause an unstoppable outbreak. 2PDF troops and Transport Security tactically take down the growing number of infected. Several overrun areas such as Primary and Secondary Schools, Hospitals, Shopping Centres and certain Military Camps are raided by Commandos and SWAT teams as well as Riot Squads in order to contain the outbreak. These areas are then cordoned off to the public.

The rapid spread of the infection has made headlines everywhere and the country begins its rapid descent into mass panic. By the end of Day 6, many have packed their luggage and flights out of the country are overbooked across most airlines. Traffic at Woodlands Checkpoint halt to a standstill and Tuas Checkpoint is completely closed off by the Malaysian Authorities. Many NSFs who refuse to face the coming onslaught decide to flee the country as well as soon as they could, reducing the effective strength of the reserve troops by up to 35%. Schools and businesses begin to close until further notice as a widespread quarantine is under way. As the situation in the country rapidly destabilizes, the daily addition of new infected individuals begin to take its toll on the manpower and widespread panic ensues.

Day 8-10
-----------
This is where everything rapidly collapses. More than 650,000 residents have successfully fled the country at this point. The infected begin to outnumber the patrol troops and overrun entire neighbourhoods such as Yishun, Bukit Panjang, Marine Parade, Bukit Timah, Pasir Ris and Serangoon. Many residents lock themselves up in their homes with stockpiles of groceries to ride out the chaos. The sounds from outside are ear-screeching, as the population rapidly succumbs to anarchy and rioting. Many take refuge in bomb shelters, high rise buildings and miitary bases. At this point, the government has declared a State of Emergency and the SAF/SPF/SCDF are fully given control of the situation and rapidly aide in the evacuation of citizens out of the country. Many safe zones are established and people who make it to these zones are transported by helicopeter to airbases to be evacuated by plane. The entire Singapore Airlines and SilkAir Fleet as well as detachments of fleets from other airlines and armies aid in the rapid evacuation of survivors. Woodlands Checkpoint is quickly overrun and as the infected make a beeline towards JB Sentral, the Malaysian Air Force napalm bombs the highway leading into Johor Bahru. The bombs are powerful enough to completely destroy it and physically detaches the country from Malaysia for the first time in several decades.

The chaos in Singapore has made headlines worldwide, causing panic in other countries as well as they quickly realize that the fear of an actual zombie outbreak happening has become reality. Social media feeds are flooded by survivors in the country begging for help and saying their goodbyes as they are overrun by the infected. SGSecure App as well as the Reddit Live Feed has listed safe zones established at major neighbourhoods for survivors to try and get to, as all military enforcement in the country has been rerouted to these zones as well as the airbases. Major military bases in SG have been abandoned with the personnel being reassigned at the evacuation zones. The MRTs are at a standstill at this point, with many major stations teeming with the infected, most notably Dhoby Ghaut, City Hall, Raffles Places and other stations within the CBD and Downtown Core. Automated trains continue to operate.

Changi Airport was quickly overrun and the entire aerodrome ceases operations. An automated message has been activated from the control tower to inform inbound aircraft at all frequencies to avoid Singapore altogether. Many survivors during the onslaught managed to get onboard the last departing planes at the several terminals before being completely overrun and many airliners remain dormant at the airport grounds.

By the 10th day, power goes out to all of Singapore and the water supply stops running. All utility services have ceased to exist as their center of operations are abandoned. Evacuation efforts continue and humanitarian aid is sent in to reinforce the safe zones and top up the number of airborne craft available. The remaining survivors outside the safe zones drop to less than 100,000 nationwide. By the 10th day more than half of the population has been evacuated and are thoroughly quarantined and decontaminated at their destinations.

Day 20
---------
The streets are dark, and overrun by the infected. The global economy is in major flux as Singapore's share in the trade game means that the downfall and cessation of operations at the Singapore Port has caused chaos in the global stock market. In a last ditch effort before abandoning the country altogether, what remains of the military decides to restore power and sends dedicated teams to clear and secure key power plants to restore energy to the country. Lights come back on and electricity is restored to all remaining residents still holed up in their homes. They send out the message far and wide across all cable program channels and analog and digital signals. SGSecure has been updated and mass messages are going everywhere in all manners possible to inform what remains of the population on where to go and what to do. The military has taken over the operations of the SMRT trains and certain stations have been cleared and converted into mini safe zones. These trains will make a beeline towards the nearest station in proximity of a safe zone or airfield where the passengers will be evacuated. They are given a list of items to bring if possible such as travel documents, birth certificates, credit cards and other valuables such as electronics. As the power goes back on, many survivors charge their phones for the first time as Telcom signals return, letting the world know that at least several thousands of survivors are still alive. Many of these people do not make it as the hordes of infected overrun them as soon as they step outside. As of now, the outbreak has been contained to Singapore and no traces of the infection are seen elsewhere in the region such as Johor Bahru. However, cases have begun to pop out in other parts of the world.

From the shores of JB and from the ships camping out off the southern coast, unattended fires plague the city skyline. After another week, the SAF and joint multinational UN forces completely pull out of the country. It is currently unknown how many survivors remain alive. The military keeps manning the power plants for several months before abandoning them, plunging the country once again into eternal darkness.


P.S: Feel free to brainstorm and include ideas of your own how certain aspects of the outbreak would play out in detail such as the military/civil defense response, nationwide protocol, impact to tourism and environment, etc.

I've been in NS coming 16 months already, but I've been hiding my depressive symptoms from everyone ever since the beginning. I thought I would get better eventually but while it has in some cases, it's worse in the fact that it actually affects me more at home then in camp.
  
Being in camp is extremely stressful as I've taken up a bit of an important role, but I've developed a mental block that somewhat makes me mentally ok most of the time handling stressful situations and whatnot. But whenever I'm alone, which I am most of the time when I'm not in camp, I do quite often get into a really depressed state, where I sometimes physically feel weak and numb overthinking things. I always fall into this mindset that I have to make use of the time I spend outside of camp as much as possible, but the amount of energy I used in camp just makes me ending up not doing much over my weekends and just wasting my entire time doing nothing. I used to play PC games really often but now I rarely touch the games I used to enjoy often as I feel it's tiring to ""start"" if that makes sense.
  
Because of this fatigue I have had an argument with my father regarding some other matters which made me burst about my frustration and stress about NS, and I have not talked to him for a few months already. I would've solved it if I was less tired but right now I feel like it's too tiring to bother about it for now.
  
The thing is I used to be counseling at SCC many months back but I stopped going for it as my counselor was getting transferred, but even so I realized that going into counseling at the time, I was not in a certain mindset which would bring out my deeper feelings, and while it may have helped for part of me, that made it seem like I got better, didn't actually help for some parts.

  
However at the moment, there is nobody available to replace me if I were to transferred for whatever reason(which I'm not sure if will even help), and I will have to at least tank till the next year. I do not want to create trouble for my Encik and/or peers in my unit as the unit has lacking manpower and I am normally one of the few that always helps out. But honestly I don't know what really is affecting me like this, and I don't know if changing anything would help in any way.

  
I'm not sure if anyone help has been in a similar position as me, but I feel that half my family breaking off when I was younger might have had some effect on me psychologically that I didn't know till I faced this much pressure. (I used to be suicidal and did attempt a few months back but I'm no longer at that phase anymore, but I won't write more as there's just too many things to write and I want to keep this shorter).
  
It has really started to make me wonder if I would be alright after I ORD, which is why I decided to ask here for any options that I myself can't see.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/a0j3yg/possible_depression_1_year_into_ns/,0.0,"['i really feel that you should prioritize your mental health over anything. it is not worth sacrificing your long term well-being for NS, especially if you‚Äôre just an NSF.\n\ni believe that in NS, no matter how important you think your NSF position is, there will be someone to replace you when shit hits the fan. the very concept of an NSF revolves around dispensability. if you make it known to your encik, hopefully he will understand. there‚Äôs a reason why you can down PES because of mental health.  this shit is extremely serious. \n\nas you‚Äôve mentioned at the start, you feel stressed when you go to camp. i‚Äôm not sure how open you are to the idea of approaching the MO to seek help, but that is definitely an avenue of help, to get everything sorted. if possible, take time off camp. get some fresh air. start NOW, don‚Äôt wait till after ORD.\n\nbest of luck to you man. i know you‚Äôre strong, and you‚Äôll get through this eventually.

155,singapore,142139,"well, 7 pax fall ill with food poisoning, but tippling club seems more concerned with liability.",9xooli,ohsixtytwo,1542392250,7,1,"i‚Äôm reposting what‚Äôs on facebook, especially in the light of the recent spize event. it‚Äôs a long read, but i think it‚Äôs an important issue:

7 DOWN WITH FOOD POISONING AFTER EATING AT TIPPLING CLUB!!!

what's the cost of a customer's life?

most of us would know about the tragedy of the patron who ate at spize, and ended up passing away from a serious case of food poisoning. 

how common are these incidents, and how seriously do restaurants handle cases like this? or is it denial at all cost and business as usual?

it hits pretty close to home, because my sis and her group of 6 friends were all collectively down with a bout of bad food poisoning following a recent visit to Tippling Club.

(for the uninformed, tippling club is a fancy joint under the spa esprit group. pretty well known, and a pretty steady occupant of ""top"" lists such as world's best bars and asia's top 50.)

the 7 of them were there to throw a bride-to-be a surprise party for her wedding that's in 3 weeks time. they were hosted on the 2nd floor private dining room and were the only patrons on that level. they hung out from 6.30pm till 11.30pm, and went home after that.

the first among them to get sick was my sis, who spent the entire sunday having diarrhoea. by monday night, her symptoms escalated to a 39.5 degree fever, vomiting, and a splitting migraine, which kept her awake the most of the night. 

the rest started having symptoms of vomiting, diarrhoea, and cramps a day after sis did, which was midday on monday.

for those who have a life, you can imagine the frustration of having your life placed on hold while you deal with the helplessness of not having any control over the ailments wrecking through your body.

the bride-to-be, busy with wedding preparations, was vomiting and having the runs while having to meet her work commitments in the form of a product launch that couldn't be moved.

another, a lecturer by profession, didn't want to leave her students in the lurch by calling in sick at the last minute, had to do toilet runs in between classes. on top of that, she also had a sick (unrelated illness) and cranky baby to manage at home.

another was vomiting, having the runs, and cramping throughout the day and had the worst of symptoms in terms of severity. she couldn't even lie down to rest because she had to cook and care for her child, without help. 

another spent 20 hours flat on her back as soon as she finished her conference call at 2.30pm on monday.

the last of them to show symptoms finally succumbed on monday night. all the clinics were closed by then, and she couldn't find time to see the doctor because she had 2 young kids at home, and no extra pair of hands to help her with them. imagine trying to settle down cranky kids in between toilet runs and holding a bin to contain your vomit.

and lastly, my sis had to work from home the entire tuesday for an important tender, while suffering from the remnants of her fever, migraine, nausea, and cramping. she also had to give her tickets to a musical away since she wasn't sure if she could bear sitting throughout a session.

what they were expecting was simple - an acknowledgement from the restaurant of a possible lapse, for them to conduct thorough investigations, corrective measures, a personal call to show they care, and an apology. because i think there's no way in hell it's mere coincidence that all 7 who spent the night together at a single restaurant could end up sick with exactly the same diagnosis given by different doctors located around the island. 

to clarify, 5 out of 7 of them saw doctors (the other 2 with toddlers had no time to go, and had to settle for self-medication). all 5 were all given 2 day medical leaves. (important point: doctors rarely give 2 days mc unless your condition is serious.)

but alas, if only it were that simple.

they got in touch with the restaurant, and what they got in exchange gave them so much pent up frustration and disappointment at the injustice of it all.

i'll sum it up:

1) message sent to ask tippling club to investigate the incident

2) restaurant manager replies, and says that in the last 24 hours, they managed to rule out food handlers (no idea how), and that they have followed up with the guests (83 in number?) to establish that no one else had any problems (they called them up separately?). 

they also requested for a diagnosis from their doctors. also says their patronage is important, and ‚Äúdespite the assertion of contamination‚Äù (how sincere!), do come down for free drinks. no apology, and the only word of empathy was ""i empathise with your distressing circumstances for your health and wellbeing"". i think that even psychopaths are more capable of faking empathy than this. 

3) sis blows up in frustration, because it was obvious from the previous email that the restaurant is saying ""so sorry not my fault. we checked."" (albeit without any details on the checks whatsoever. it's like ""yes i promise, just trust me on this that i checked‚Äù) 

sis also asks them to keep their free cocktails and shove it up their ass. okay i joke, she asks them to donate the equivalent amount to some charity. (she's a far better person than i am, though she did ask them to do so anonymously so that they wouldn't be eligible for tax deductions. on second thoughts, perhaps she's just a far better person at being scheming than me)

4) case gets passed over to a senior customer care exec (because of the total beatdown my sis gave the restaurant manager), wishes everyone is recovering well, and says no patron complained about food poisoning from that night. (looks like they didn't call up patrons after all). and yes, she would like a diagnosis from the doctor (never mind you're all still sick, get me my diagnosis goddammit).

5) sis encloses mc, prescriptions, photos of medicine since it's obvious from those images that they're being treated for food poisoning. she also expresses willingness to provide letters of authorisation allowing tippling club to contact their GPs directly for more information about the diagnosis, because quite frankly, they have spent enough time over this matter. 

sis also reports the case to nea; 7 out of 7 with exact same symptoms is no coincidence after all, and they didn't want to risk anyone else getting sick. 

6) restaurant replies to say well they can't contact the doctor on their behalf because of PDPA (i call bullshit because waivers could be signed according to singapore medical association). claims they are just concerned because the last 10 years they never had any incident like this occurring before. (well, spize too.) (oh in terms of false claims, a quick 1min google search produced a hungrygowhere review that says he had bad fish from tippling and ended up sick. screenshot attached!)

---

that's the end of the email thread so far, because i don't know, what else is there to be done? even if all 5 of them went down to their doctors to get letters, would tippling club even entertain and acknowledge the possibility of a hygiene lapse? I have my doubts. and to me it's indicative that tippling doesn't really grasp the gravity of the situation and the harm potentially caused, since at no point in time did they even give them a call to ask about their wellbeing. 

is it a single occurrence at a single restaurant? let‚Äôs see. food for thought - here are 3 comments from a local reddit thread on the topic:

""... We had food poisoning (documented, complained and ignored) at Equinox twice in a row before the news broke.""

""You would be surprised to hear that a hotel in Singapore is known among industry insiders to not have gloves or clingfilm in their kitchen. They just don't use them to save costs.""

""I work in a number of malls and you'd be amazed at the number of restaurant staff I have spotted not washing their hands after using the toilets. (This is while they're in full uniform, btw!)""

source: https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9x0yed/sats_officer_who_fell_sick_after_consuming_food/

so let me ask you again, what's the cost of a customer's life? this time, my sis and her friends were lucky enough to just be down for 5 days, and are on their way back to recovery. 

but do we need to wait for mass food poisoning hospitalisation outbreak, or even for a death to occur each time, before restaurants are willing to listen and take this seriously?

p/s: my sis and her friends are all professionals in their fields, so they're not out for a free meal, nor is it out of malice. the refund would go to a charity organisation if it were ever given.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9xooli/well_7_pax_fall_ill_with_food_poisoning_but/,0.0,['Whoever wrote this wall of text sounds like an entitled asshole.

156,singapore,146824,Do we save enough? Should I go back to work before the planned date?,a7aiyo,Islandgirlnowhere,1545135144,85,1,"I became a stay home Mum after I developed complications during my second pregnancy. 

My husband earns around 9k, we have a helper, 2 kids and cook 3 meals at home most days. 

I did freelance work until recently when I lost my mojo and my agency had problems paying me on time. 

I grew up in a household where my parents were reckless spenders, they faced bankruptcy and I spent my 20s scrimping and saving just to help tide them through. I literally starved myself and stayed home all weekends till my late 20s. 

After struggling through all the shit my family has put me through, I have saved up about $100k on my own. 

So thing is, now we save about $1-1.5k each month after all our expenses. My hubby has a study loan to pay off till 2020, after which, we will have another excess of $1.2k per month. We also have enough cash to settle our mortgage in full if anything happens to his job. 

I get very jittery and think that $1k each month in savings is very little. I want to go back to work yet worry about the kids care. 

1. The childcare centres around our neighbourhood cost $1.8k each month for full day childcare. 
2. My elder one has asthma-like symptoms each time she gets a cold. She was sick almost every 2 weeks this year and I‚Äôve been the one accompanying her to doctor visits and bringing her back to health. 
3. Both our parents and siblings do not help us even when we have emergencies with the kids, so we do not have Plan B if I return to work. 
4. My husband‚Äôs job requires him to clock in very long hours, often close to midnight. 

Of late, I‚Äôve tried to reach out to recruiters and send in job applications. I get mixed responses from some assuring me that I‚Äôve got a decent list of accomplishments, I shouldn‚Äôt worry about finding a job at the same salary, to me having to accept anything that comes my way now because I‚Äôve been out of the market for 2 years already. 

Any stay home mums here who manage to find their way back to the corporate world after years of absence? How did you get your jobs? Did you have to take a massive pay cut? 

Or do you think we are doing decent and I can stay home for another year before I can finally send both to half day school in 2020? That way my helper can manage better and they would have outgrown some of their atopic conditions by then?

158,singapore,0,Need advice about failing A levels and depression,5lq50a,TinyPotatoHopes,1483420697,38,63,"Hi reddit, this is something that has been troubling me for a while.

My best friend did badly for As in 2015 (as in can‚Äôt go uni, even private uni) and chose to retake A levels in 2016, but does not feel she will do well either or just do marginally better. (waiting for results to be out)

She told me she feels like shes suffering from depression ‚Äì has the usual symptoms like losing interest in things she used to enjoy, difficulty concentrating, pessimism, etc. For the whole of 2016 she‚Äôs also turned off her phone. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs for removing distractions (because when we meet up, she sometimes say hey I wanna show you this really good singer on Youtube). But rather, she seems to dislike social interaction, and see no point in communicating with other humans (except me and her family).

I‚Äôm kinda afraid and worried too, I feel like I‚Äôm watching her hover at this bad point and not sure what to do. I think failing A levels hit her really hard. I know it‚Äôs up to oneself to pick yourself up after bad stuff, but as a friend I just want to provide advice, hugs and some hot soupy noodles.

So my questions are:

1. What do you guys / what does society think about people who can‚Äôt study? What is the reality for people with low / no academic qualifications? Do people look down on them? 

2. If fail A levels again, what would you guys advise her to do? 

Personally I advised her its okay if you can‚Äôt study, but to get monetary compensation, you must offer your skills / time / labour to someone, and so to increase your own monetary value you need to get SKILLS like coding, public speaking, writing, how to teach tuition (which is pretty profitable in SG), sales, life coach etc. Which brings me to my 3rd point. She says she doesn‚Äôt feel any motivation at all, like she could waste away at home..

3. If she has depression / wants to find out what‚Äôs going on with her, where can she go for a counsellor / therapist? She comes from a low income family (both parents are tailors), and stays in a 3 room flat, and mental health seems to be considered ‚Äúfluffy‚Äù or not really impt to spend money on.

TLDR; best friend failed A level twice, might have depression, low-income family, advice?

",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/5lq50a/need_advice_about_failing_a_levels_and_depression/,0.0,"[""Not an expert, but I feel like her main concern now is to seek help for her mental issues. It does not matter now many times she retake A levels, she is not going to do well if her mental state is not in the right place. As a fellow A level student, I was under tremendous amount of stress from my family and teachers throughout my J2 life ( I should have retained but I promoted because of immense moderation, hence I couldn't cope in J2 ), and there were days where everything felt so hopeless there was a week two months before A levels where I did zero studying as nothing could go into my mind; I was just too upset and the sense of failure was overwhelming. She may have retook A levels, but if she felt the same way as I did for the whole of 2016, chances are she's not going to do well again. \n\n""]"
159,singapore,0,I recently had an abortion in Singapore. Here's some updated information. Questions are welcome :),5srn2n,aborted_in_SG,1486544783,334,1256,"I asked the mods if I could do a post with my throwaway, because information on this subreddit is quite outdated especially on prices of abortions. (Edited for formatting. Also warning: fairly long post though I tried to be as concise as possible)

**How I got pregnant**: accident of course. Boyfriend and I used to use condoms but I developed some sort of allergy to latex so we stopped using them. He never finishes in me, but we also had a lot of intercourse during my fertile period which was when I miraculously got knocked up. *In short, we were completely reckless*.

**How I found out**: late period. That's it. No other signs of pregnancy. When it was late by 2 weeks I decided to take the test over a period of 2 days. Both came out extremely positive.

**What we did**: abortion through a private clinic.

**Why private clinic over public hospital? Isn't that more expensive?**: No, it's not. It's like the exact same price, around 2k. I looked up info on this subreddit but most of it is really outdated. It's impossible to find an abortion for under 1k now, even in a public hospital. With a referral from a polyclinic, an abortion at KK Hospital is $900 to $1500 just for the procedure alone. Antibiotics, consultations, ultrasound scans, etc are all separate charges.

I'm guessing $900 is for an early pregnancy (8 weeks max) and $1500 is for those farther along. Most private clinics price like this too. The problem is, even if you make your appointment while being considered an early pregnancy, by the time you get to your appointment you'll be considered beyond 8 weeks already. Eg: chances are you find out you're pregnant at around 5 weeks (missing your period and waiting in vain for it to arrive), make an appointment (the earliest one for us was A MONTH LATER), and you'll be considered 9 weeks already and need to pay $1500. And a month is a long time - you'll probably start showing some symptoms by then, like morning sickness, which is horrible if you need this to be kept secret from your family and friends.

We initially wanted to go the public route as we thought it would be cheaper, but since their earliest appointment date was a month later (and time is of the essence in this situation), we looked up private clinics that do abortions and found the price to be pretty much the same but MUCH faster. If you call on a Friday, you can go for the consultation and scan on Saturday, then Tuesday is the actual abortion procedure. And you go back for a checkup one week later, that's all there is to it.

For both private and public routes, you can use your MediSave. Up to $900, if I'm not wrong. The problem is that's not anonymous. If you don't wish for anyone to find out, especially your parents, you shouldn't use MediSave.

**The counseling part of this whole abortion shebang**: I had to be ""counseled"" twice since we tried to go through the public route first but went through private in the end. The polyclinic immediately sent me to a different room to be counseled. It was just some old lady telling me that my baby can feel that I don't want it and it's sad, and it can feel all the pain and sadness and I need to apologize to it if I decide to go through with the abortion. PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH IF YOU WISH TO ABORT, if you bother to research you will know IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE FETUS TO FEEL THESE THINGS UNTIL IT'S A LATE TERM PREGNANCY. **DO NOT LET THEM GUILT TRIP YOU INTO KEEPING AN UNWANTED CHILD YOU ARE NOT PREPARED FOR**.

Private clinic counseling was easy, I just watched a video on how abortions are done and the risks behind it.

That's pretty much all the pertinent information I can think of right now. If you have any questions you can comment and I'll reply ASAP. If you wish to keep it private you can PM me, I will do my best to help you :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/5srn2n/i_recently_had_an_abortion_in_singapore_heres/,0.0,"[""What's the recovery process like - was there any pain, discomfort, bleeding etc?

Didn't thought I'd make it that far so I'm really proud of myself. I was miserable during the whole ordeal though, so out of frustration, I compiled a brief list of some of the events that's happening in July. Now, there's definitely way more stuff going on out there than these few, so if I missed out on anything you like just let me know. Oh, and there are some genres which I'm really unfamiliar with though (such as EDM, hip-hop, etc) so I really need some help with those. I'll keep updating this as I go.

161,singapore,0,[Serious] I dont think I'm gonna be able to survive NS,7g2v9i,SinYang13,1511859567,37,0,"Would have used a throwaway but I needed answers as soon as I can. I really need help.

Here me out before you say ""eh don't pretend you cannot lah everyone gone through this before""

Back in 2015, I started feeling, let's say, ""wrong"". My body started feeling weird. No, it wasn't puberty. I was 13, just starting Secondary 1. Then, this ""lump in my throat"" started appearing every few weeks. One day it was there, one day it wasn't. It wasn't a huge deal, until it somehow got worse. It started arriving everytime I was nervous, everytime after I ate food, when I was exercising, basically just about everytime I didn't want it too. You may be wondering, it's just a placebo, there's nothing bad about it. Well that's where you're wrong. I would get this ""bubbles coming from my stomach"" feeling, like a constant burping every few seconds. It would increase in intensity, like once every 10 seconds to once every second and it felt painful. Then once it sort of peaked, I would have this really bad gag reflex for a few minutes, then it would go away for awhile before returning after awhile.

You're probably wondering why I didn't just go straight to a doctor. Well I did, at the start of this year when it got really bad. They diagnosed me with a mild acid reflux, but when you compare the symptoms, I just knew that that wasn't what it was.

Fast forward 2 years to where I am now. I can't wear anything that remotely comes close to touching my neck due to the gag reflex, taking medicine has no effect whatsoever, and speaking of which I can't take tablets due to the aforementioned throat problem.

I still have a few more years before I have to enlist, and I'm almost certain that this won't go away in the future. Which means that my adult life finding a job is probably screwed, but let's focus on NS first. I just know that I'm not even going to be able to survive one day, as that reflex hits me the worst whenever I do sports. Not to mention my claustrophobia which looks like it's gonna be headache.

So thanks for reading my story, but does anyone know of any solutions to my dilemma? If you want me to serve my 2 years, I'd happily do it, provided that my body can actually handle it.

Oh and before someone says it, I know many people who aren't fit at all go through BMT and they come out in very good shape. But that really isn't the case here. I'm actually quite fit (not muscular but can still do physical activities quite well if it wasn't for the gag reflex).

Also, I would presume that you have to go through some medical examination before you get enlisted? I'm scared that they're just gonna diagnose me with the same reflux.

0,NationalServiceSG,4361,Some suggestions interacting with peers and getting through 2 years,inesmq,junglewarfarettx,1599362086,11,1,"Currently a sgt in my unit, i'll be ORDing next year. 

Wondering if any of y'all have any kind suggestions to overcome the problems I face in my unit, and also some general motivational tips to get thru the 2 years.

Some problems:

1) Not being able to clique with my platoon sergeant. Tbh the sergeants don't quite like his style of commanding. Perhaps it has to do with his short temper, he gets pissed very easily when he's stressed and then he starts yelling. Doesn't really work well under high stress situations. Unnecesarily angry sometimes. When we don't do exactly what he says, he questions us much like how a teacher questions a defiant student. 

How do you even manage this kind of guy? 

2) Little welfare for the sergeants from PS and PC. Honestly feels like the PS prohibits us from reporting sick, and doesn't want us to report sick for light symptoms. Feels like if you do report sick for a legit symptom, they'll make your life unnecessarily harder by calling you twice a day to check on you and even do multiple house checks.

3) Feels like NS is a waste of my 2 years. There are just so many redundant procedures, that honestly sometimes it doesn't make sense. PC doesn't like it when we ask him more questions on the task he gives us, but rather wants us to go ask other ppl. 

I've been trying to squeeze in time to learn things that i'm interested in, like coding and investing, or even some year 1 uni stuff to prep for uni. But it isn't efficient learning on my tiny phone screen. Hence, i'll usually resort to studying on the weekends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/inesmq/some_suggestions_interacting_with_peers_and/,1.0,"['I was recently told by my PS that one has to be certified through a course and everything before they are allowed to house visit you.

My POP will be in 2-3 weeks time and I‚Äôm already on MC for 18 days due to ARI symptoms and fever. A little bit of myself, I‚Äôm in enhanced batch (9 weeks BMT) and have missed shit tons of HK such as CQB, FC, BTP etc. My last route march was 4km and my mates are already at 12km. I‚Äôve gotten a silver for my latest IPPT.

The real question is, will I be able to graduate?

Off topic, throughout my three weeks of BMT (inclusive 2 weeks confinement week) I had heat rashes and went to see the MO and he said mine was severe despite the training wasn‚Äôt that strenuous so I was given few days Excused Uniform. He told me if the same thing still persists, see him again and he will probably refer me to specialist. I had this issue back then when I was young as my skin is sensitive and it was so bad that I was itching whole body every time. What cured me was sitting in front of a strong fan all the time and not sweat with my calamine lotion all over my body. Since then I wasn‚Äôt in camp due to being sick as mentioned above and only booked in last week for a few days it was a short week.

3,NationalServiceSG,4163,Questions About My Vision,idwta3,OxySempra,1598016858,5,1,"So around 2 days ago, around the late morning/afternoon time, I was just resting in bunk waiting for lunch outration when I felt a sever sharp pain behind both of my ears that spread to the sides of my head in what felt laster for a minute or so. 

During the pain, I laid my head down and started to feel dizzy. I also started to see what looked like coloured static in my vision, mixed with what looked like drizzling rain when I try to see farther stuff. This is in addition to the sides of my vision darkening in sync with the pulsating pain.

My sectionmates advised me to maybe try and sleep it off, so I tried to sleep on my bed. 

I have slept for what felt like 10-20 minutes when I suddenly felt extremely nauseous and limped to the toilet. (Unrelated knee injury)

I tried to vomit, but nothing came out. 

I then went back to my bunk to rest for a little while longer before the next activity (RSAF talk). That was when I noticed that the vision anomalies that I am seeing are still there.

After talking about it with my sectionmates, I decided to go see the MO after the talk. 

When I went to see the MO, he suspected I had a retinal detachment and sent me out to Changi General Hospital Accident and Emergency. 

I waited for around 3 to 4 hours, alongside a slightly disgruntled Sergeant from another platoon. (the next day is his off day, so he would have been home relaxing by now if it wasn't for me)

The ophthalmologist finally had the time to see me, and she did various tests on my eyes and asked me various questions.

She suspect that I have something called Visual Snow, and that I have to come back at a later date for an MRI.

So, she then issued me a day MC and scheduled an appointment for the MRI. The day MC was then extended to 2 days after the sergeant talked to the doctor. (I assume is because of the whole logistics of booking in tomorrow morning. Context: it is already 9ish PM)

But after we waited a while longer for her to finalise the documents, she consulted with her supervisor and she extended my MC to 4 days. And then after another talk with the supervisor, she admitted me for a head CT scan and MRI.

I then spent an entire night waiting to get warded, which had the sergeant who was in charge of escorting me not being able to sleep, because he can't finish his report. The COS was unable to sleep because of that too, along with the platoon commander of another platoon, and the SDO.

So yeah, I might have gotten marked lol.

Anyways, bypassing all that, I am now waiting for the MRI which is scheduled to be held on Monday, though the doctor is trying to push for earlier. (Which I doubt, since I have another existing MRI appointment with CGH as well for my knee, to be held on the... 2nd of November.)

My current symptoms (excluding knee pain):
- Seeing colour static all over my vision
- Seeing drizzling rain at a distance when there is no rain
- Night vision becoming worse, as the static is very strong the darker it gets, to the point where I can barely see in the dark anymore.
- Occasional sharp pain behind my right ear that lasts for a few seconds
- Sudden ringing of my ear and reduced/muffled hearing for a few seconds. Sometimes preceding the sharp pain I feel behind my ear. (This is on top of the already existing ringing in my ears I have for a while now)

The doctor stated that this will probably be permanent and I will have this for life, and that there is no cure for this. And that I will have to get used to it.

I am currently about 4 or 5 weeks in to BMT (enlisted 20th July), PES BP.

Before this whole thing happened, I was already on like a total of 30 days, ending 31st August, of RMJ+excuse squatting+prolonged standing, and on crutches for my knee pain.

I was already fearing OOT/OOC from that. Coupled with this new vision problems, how fucked am I?

3 weeks ago, I suffered a psychotic break and was brought to IMH, where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I have had several episodes throughout the year but it worsened to the point I had to be taken to the emergency department. Since I am due to be enlisted (SCDF) in october, the psychiatrist gave me a letter which she instructed me to give to my Medical Officer. However, I have to wait till december for my full course of meds and therapy, but since my symptoms are severe, I was prescribed sedative pills to be able to bear with them for the time being.

My symptoms are not improving, ranging from severe depression to anxiety and psychosis (delusions, people following me, out to kill me etc) and panic attacks. The pills help but the control I have over my condition is very delicate. The probability of me doing something stupid seem to increase with each passing day.

I was initially happy with getting SCDF, since I was shooting for it anyway. I felt like it would give me the opportunity to handle real-life problems and work on the ground. However, this condition is unexpected, and even after being diagnosed and put on temporary meds, I am neither ready nor sure if I can continue my life like this, needless to say my NS period. My world is black, everything has become meaningless and dull, and death would be very welcome (sorry). My fear and psychosis are no longer in the mind, but they feel very instinctual, real, and raw. It is bad

Should I declare my condition to CMPB now, or wait till enlistment? I dont want to live weak and afraid, but all I am is terrified and depressed all the time. I am currently Pes E9 due to an unrelated heart condition.

enlisted on Nov 16, BMTC sch v. it's only been 3-4 days, but it's been taking a serious toll on my mental health

i have a history of depression and anxiety, but I've been steadily getting better since the start of this year -- until I got my enlistment date. throughout the month of Nov I could kind of tell that my depressive symptoms were precipitating, but I thought I could be fine, until I actually enlisted

i broke down in the med facility while talking to the psych twice  (1st and 2nd day), and I had a panic attack on the morning of the 2nd day, which was completely unprecedented (last time that happened was in sec 4, so like 4 or so years ago). I've completely lost my appetite (I didn't even eat 2nd and 3rd day, I felt like vomiting if I ate any more than 2 or 3 spoonfuls), and I've been absolutely wiped in terms of mental fatigue and anxiety

I don't want to indict any of the staff there -- most of the sgts and my pc are really understanding, but it feels like I'm still forced to stay even though I'm pretty sure being there is the cause (I don't think it's an adjustment thing, and even if it were I wouldn't be this mentally destroyed since I'm pretty flexible). I just feel like crying all the time, and ive been contemplating some really bad stuff because of how hopeless everything seems.

I understand that it's kind of the sgts/pc/officers job to make sure you do your 2 years, but my main problem IS the 2 years. I can't even do two more days at the rate I'm going down

I was speaking to my psych about down pesing, and what she recommended was I tough out a few more days so I can justify my inability to serve to the MO (whom I'll be meeting on the 26th at NUH). I know that I have no other choice but to tough it out, at least until I can get my MC this Friday/weekend till the appointment, but what I'm worried is that the MO's just going to be dismissive about my concerns and will only really be focused on getting me to do the 2 years. if anyone here has any advice they can give about this then I would be really grateful. sorry if this is too long or whiny, idk what to do

However, since enlistment I feel like my mental health has been deteriorating. In BMT, my sergeants told me that I am just adjusting to military life. So, I did not pay much attention to it.

Around 2019 a lot of my small medical problems became bigger and bigger 
I have seen a few specialist about different symptoms and they all have told me I have this I have that but I never asked them for a medical diagnosis 

Currently I Suffer from Irritable bowel syndrome , Chronic  Tension headache and Migraines

Basically I have constipation &amp; diarrhea on and off and the whole day I have stomach pains and headache for the whole day till night sometimes I need pain killers just to sleep All my medicine only help to lessen the pain but sometimes it‚Äôs unbearable and I need to sleep the whole day 

My Doctors all just give me medicine and tell me to test if it works. They always tell me THEY think it‚Äôs this        But now I‚Äôm in a state of panic because I don‚Äôt know if they put my conditions into the system since they always say they THINK 

I don‚Äôt know if I can live through ns with unbearable headaches and Stomach Pains 24/7. 
I‚Äôm Currently PES B4 ( They don‚Äôt know about all of these new symptoms) 
I don‚Äôt know how to get my medical documents",https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/eijb1d/about_pes/,0.0,['I‚Äôm curious about how you have constipation and diarrhoea at the same time?']
23,NationalServiceSG,834,NS PES E9 @ Kranji Camp II,d9vd9l,madridista_011,1569558782,6,7,"Am enlisting soon and a facing a lot of anxiety &amp; stress. Really hope to seek advice from this forum as my case may be unprecedented. To give a rough background of myself, I'm not a healthy &amp; fit individual with numerous health issues, including severe scoliosis that causes frequent back pains. I'm also severely underweight at risk of nutritional deficiency (although I generally eat a lot), and physically I do not look good at all like a skeleton (and was even compared to people from 3rd-world countries). (As such I also have low self-esteem.)

Based on symptoms and preliminary check-ups recently, I may be diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, a digestive system disorder which causes my intestines to be unable to absorb nutrients &amp; even weight loss. I suspect I might already have contracted this disease many years ago (but wasn't aware of it) as I've been very skinny all this while since my secondary school days.

As such I anticipate more follow-up specialist appointments (e.g. for endoscopy) to come in the near future, but by the time I would already have been enlisted. I may also be required to adhere to a strict dietary regime in light of my condition, and I'm not sure if the cookhouse food is suitable for me. Based on my last medical screening @ CMPB last year (which somehow didn't detect my digestive system disorder maybe because there were no such tests for it), my default status currently is I do not have a Permanent Excuse (Stay-In). Therefore, my burning questions are:

1. Will I be able see the MO on my enlistment day to urgently update my condition and be granted a stay-out BMT, or do I have to stay-in for a few days first before I can meet the MO?
2. Can I continue to seek treatment for my condition, unhindered, while serving my NS? (E.g. Can I be granted time-off to go for my specialist appointment, if and when there is one?)

I really do appreciate any advice/guidance after reading this post. Thanks much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/d9vd9l/ns_pes_e9_kranji_camp_ii/,0.0,['tahan one day maybe then next day report sick then MO confirm do what is allowed (SOP) if not just sound out when enlisting.\n\nand yes time off is granted if you got evidence no worries army welfare bro']
24,NationalServiceSG,942,Panic Attacks,dqvctc,poiu91,1572752673,3,8,"Hello guys, my PES Status is B1(enhanced batch) and I am currently 1 month into my BMT. So over the month, I realised I have been having panic attacks. To be honest, I have rarely gotten panic attacks prior to NS so I don‚Äôt really know what the symptoms are but seeing as to how frequent it seemed to be occurring nowadays I figured I searched the symptoms up and apparently panic attacks checks out for me.

Apart from panic attacks, I would would also randomly jolt up in the middle of the night multiple times every night with heavy breathing and fast beating of the heart.

I also recently finished my Live HG throw but I am still having traumas of what ifs? E.g. I didn‚Äôt hold on tight enough to the safety lever even after pulling the pin? Or what if I accidentally drop the live grenade and my commander ends up getting killed because of my mistake? Not to mention, in the days before the live HG throw, I also have these nightmares.

The reason why I am writing this is because I am not sure if this is worthy of visiting the MO for? Plus, I am also afraid they would think I am trying to chao keng.

So hopefully you guys can give me your honest opinion about this! Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/dqvctc/panic_attacks/,0.0,"['See the MO, request for a referral to IMH and let a professional psychiatrist diagnose you.']"
