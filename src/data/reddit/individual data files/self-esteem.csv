i’m so naturally stupid at everything i do and i know that whatever work i put in rn will all be lost. i have never been this stressed out in my life and i know this is normal for a level students but this is seriously preventing my from studying effectively and i feel that i need to solve it NOW.

1,SGExams,39949,[rant] how can i get rid of this retarded teacher?,hdqb2x,darrenyew_,1592823727,41,1,"***if you read to the end, thanks for being a cool dude***


soo basically in school, i take both physics and chemistry, and i pretty much suck at phyiscs like entire cohort, and my physics teacher comes to class every single day to persuade us to drop to combined science. 

for the past 5 years, my school has done pretty badly in physics, the principal probably scolded the physics department a lot for the bad results. which is why my teacher probably keeps asking us to drop to combined science, so that if anyone of us screws up combined science, the chemistry department can shoulder the responsibility. 

all along my school has been doing well for chemistry and i think the physics department is jealous of the limelight

if we all drop the physics subject, the department will also get whooped for failing to help us keep up with the syllabus, so he just harps on making us drop to combined science to make the chemistry department share the blame if anyone screws up

this week we have 3 surprise physics tests for no fucking reason, i think my teacher just wants to destroy our self esteem for physics so we will give in and drop to combined science to save his ass from getting whooped from the principal

im seriously fucking sick of my teacher coming in to class for the last 3 weeks just to tell us about how ""amazing"" combined science is while he just wants the chemistry department to get whooped too if we fail

he goes from showing us the syllabus to past year results to giving us tons of tests to destroy our self confidence, and i just wanna end it once and for all, can someone give suggestions on how i can fucking make this fucking trashass teacher shut up? thanks in advance

* Study smart and not hard. I belong to the group that struggle with O level but excel for A levels. How to study smart (easiest way) - prepare for topics ahead of class, listen in class, do your homework, revise and recap. 

In Junior college

* Learn how to be confident of myself and succeed in scholarship interview. I did well for A level but that’s because I invested so much time in my studies. The funny part about 2 years of hardcore mugging? It is not about the struggle with exam stress and syllabus. It’s the struggle with choosing my major and being calm for my scholarship interview (prepared super hard but failed)

In university

* Learn how to manage my finances: It’s really cool to start working after O levels and earned some pocket money. This is the moment where I splurged and didn’t save much. As a student, we don’t really spend much time managing our expenses because we are so occupied with studies. So I only learn how to be more savvy with my money AFTER university.

3,SGExams,37786,[Poly] From Terrible O levels to Course Medalist AMA,gx0q17,lucielkun27,1591345999,49,1,"I was considering whether to do an AMA for the longest time, especially with COVID-19 affecting lessons and CCAs. So... Since I am free, here I am.

Most probably, some of you may have seen my comments on numerous posts regarding Scholarships and University applications. Some of you may even know who I am. Regardless, I shall give a small summary of myself before you hit me with questions regarding Scholarships, Polytechnic Life (can't exactly help with curriculum since unfortunately, I am not exactly a programmer) or Uni applications.

**Past**

I was massively bullied in secondary school, which resulted in my low self-esteem (and skipping school 80-90% of the time.) Thanks to MOE, I managed to get transferred out to complete my O levels at the expense of additional 1 more year. As expected from a person without much secondary school knowledge, I did really badly but managed to get into Computer Engineering. (I chose DCPE out of practicality since (i) Smart Nation, and (ii) people say engineering can jump ship lol)

**Polytechnic**

One lecturer believed in me despite my past and supported my growth throughout SP. Long story short, for those who are curious about my portfolio (since I received PMs on how I managed to get into quite a number of interviews):

1. Led a Student-Led Initiative to found my own CCA
2. Was involved in a total of 9 events organizing committees
3. Represented my school for a minister presentation and YMAC
4. Gotten the CSIT Diploma Scholarship to fund my 3 years (which I am really grateful for) and went to intern with them for 22 weeks
5. And yes, gotten course medalist and top graduate, among other awards at my final year

**Future**

I have accepted SUTD Global Distinguished Scholarship, with the intention to go ESD. I rejected SMU Computing and Law and NTU Data Science and AI. I am also trying my luck to apply for an overseas university. (Sorry US, since collegeboard doesn't have an available SAT slot for me, I shall look at UK only :&lt;)

I just want to leave one important advice here: Do not let society's assumed indicators of future successes determine what you are. Always believe in yourself and do the right thing; one day, you'll see yourself at the pinnacle with the rest of your peers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gx0q17/poly_from_terrible_o_levels_to_course_medalist_ama/,1.0,"['Not really a question but good on you man for your achievements despite your past.

4,SGExams,26206,[A Levels] i have never been more conflicted - nyjc vs rjc,ephudf,fricklesfrackle,1579172317,8,1,"my l1r5 is 7 raw, 5 nett, and i'm undoubtedly stuck between these two decisions. both schools are the same distance from my house so that doesn't really matter, and i want to do arts in both. however, the moment i stepped into NYJC i really felt so comfortable and instantly liked it very much and i could honestly envision myself there - yet the fear of not going to RJC (where i think i could also learn a lot) as a ""missed opportunity"" remains very real. for RJC, though, i didn't feel as comfortable as i did in NYJC, naturally.  
i'm someone whose self-esteem takes a hit very easily/constantly compares myself to others (which is something that i'm aware that i have to work on) and i'm afraid going into RJC will push me to cower in a corner, rather than coax me out of my shell. after all, there are so many brilliant people there so what makes me think i can hold a candle to them? i feel like in NYJC i would be able to find a strong support system and i could really thrive there, but RJC does indeed provide many opportunities that would teach me a lot too. so this really is a happy problem but i'm stuck between two fantastic options and i have no idea what will ultimately be ""right"" for me since there are both pros and cons to both. 

i'm afraid i'll be miserable in RJC if i do make it in, because honestly... my gut/heart tells me NY but practicality/logic tells me RJ. i'd appreciate any advice on this situation because the deadline is pressing and i'm nowhere near coming to a conclusion!! thank youuu",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ephudf/a_levels_i_have_never_been_more_conflicted_nyjc/,0.0,"['Hi!

5,SGExams,26153,[O Levels] Everything was going okay-ish until now - I don’t know what to do.,ep5u9x,GloomyMain,1579111640,5,1,"If you’ve known me from my previous post about the vent then yeah here I am. I surprisingly did not do as badly as I expected and I am qualified to enter some poly courses and a few JCs + MI. 

At first I wanted to go into media related courses but my parents were against it— still are. They started asking me questions and telling me a lot of “facts” (not sure if it’s 100%)  that just really made me question a lot of things and life decisions aha

As most parents would, they want me to go for jc since I have somewhat a chance. But idk... I really don’t know if it’s for me, you know? I had mental breakdowns with O’s... and even if I did as okay as I did for O’s in A’s in regards to results... can my mental health really put up with the stress?  I’m not diagnosed as clinically depressed or anxiety or anything like that and I’m not a huge fan of self diagnosis but when I say I have a low self esteem and that I over think a lot to the extent it drives me to tears during o level period especially— believe me. 

At the same time do I mind jc? I have nothing against it and if I somehow ended up entering then oh well. I’m not hugely against it, so it’s more of worried and afraid I guess.
Because from what I heard if you go jc, it’s stressful and well free time is quite scarce and maybe I sound selfish but I kind of want a little free time for myself for personal hobbies, you know? And i know i know— this shouldn’t be a problem if I manage my time well. But idk I heard jc is hectic? Please correct me if I’m wrong.

But I also am aware that poly comes with its own set of obstacles. So there’s that. Idk man...

And the fact I had an argument with parents and am in tears again now doesn’t help lol. I can’t say it’s their fault because I personally feel that I do indeed have some blame because heck am I indecisive and other stuff that is too much of a mess and personal that I rather not specify, well yeah haha...

Should I give jc a chance or do something poly related that isn’t media like business or engineering or something ? 

The sad thing is even from the vent post up till now I have no goals. Zero. For the entire holidays I’ve been thinking about it every night but in the end I always remain lost. Isn’t life just great? I don’t know what I want to do and it’s distressing me so much. Yes I said I did want to go into Media- but I never really had an end goal in mind (Eg. Career basically) media just looked like something I’d genuinely enjoy and after I went for open house it still more or less is. Even for jc, it’s ok. But preferably poly, i guess. 

Maybe that’s why I don’t mind jc - even if it might take a toll on me. Maybe that’s why I don’t mind poly courses that might not be 1000% what I’m into - even if it may let me feel discontented in the end.  Because I have zero goals. None. I’m pathetic, aren’t I?

I’m sorry if this post is messy and contradicting. I’m in a mess right now and I think this post pretty much explains how much of a mess my mind is in and how much I am confused. 

Apologies if I sound like an idiotic brat rambling about being lost. I don’t expect someone to spoon-feed me the answers to my dilemma. I’m just venting it out and maybe just want to hear some advice?? Idk sigh. Less than a day or two left and here I am. Lost. I don’t even know what to say to myself Haha..",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ep5u9x/o_levels_everything_was_going_okayish_until_now_i/,0.0,"['I think the thing you should do now is take a step back and take a breather as you are currently in deep thoughts and contradicting yourself everywhere, leaving yourself in a mess.\n\nAs for poly vs JC, I would’ve said pursue your passions but after reading what you have to say, I would say that it’s best you look around and see something you can actually visualise yourself doing for the next say, 10, 20, 30 years down the road and still enjoying it. If you have a rough idea of what you want to pursue like business or engineering but still unsure of what to pursue as your specialisation, go for common programmes as they serve as a way to help you make a better decision for yourself. Even if you have no goal in mind at the moment, try making a goal out of it, to succeed.\n\nAs for JC, yes its pretty stressful because you have a lot of things to learn in preparation for one final paper to decide your fate whereas in poly there are 6 semesters, and even if you mess up one semester, you can always pick up from the remaining 5 semesters. Usually the last semesters are internships or final year projects and they provide you real world experiences to apply the skills you have spent years studying but it doesn’t mean that it’s not as stressful as JC as you need to stay consistent. As of your current self-esteem, I would suggest spending this holiday reflecting on yourself and getting yourself back to shape before school starts. And if needed, please seek professional help as high anxiety is a common issue in our education system. Hope you get better soon and that this actually helps you.']"
6,SGExams,36917,[A Levels] Advice on how to become motivated to study,gqebaz,doretdelalumiere,1590424880,39,1,"Note : This is applicable for everybody! If you're in poly, O levels, A levels, university, it doesn't really matter.

I've been seeing a lot of posts talking about lack of motivation with the CB, not wanting to do anything, etc. Here are a couple of tips from someone who used to procrastinate a ton at home and was super unmotivated when studying.

The first thing you need to do is establish reason. Why are you studying? What do you hope to accomplish beyond getting good grades? For me the primary reason was spite, to spite my parents, my friends, and also my low self esteem and certainty of failure by showing all of the above I could do well. Very petty, yes. If you can't find a general reason beyond 'get good grades so I can get high paying job' the second most important thing you can do is establish interest. 

I remember I loathed chemistry. I still dislike H2 Chem. Everything about the subject just seemed endlessly, ceaselessly difficult to the point where I didn't even want to do anything. Then I stumbled across a couple of YouTube channels, namely Explosions&amp;Fire and Explosions&amp;Ire(where a man mixes chemicals go BOOM!), and Nilered, one of whose videos was about melting impure gold to create pure gold. I realised that chemistry was something more than just stupid, annoying, formulas, that it had real world applications you could use and that really helped me to proceed with the subject. Maybe you might hate real world applications of something and like the abstract theory more. Create interest in your subjects!

Some other things to keep in mind when studying :

A) I was always slacking in my room, so I went to my mum's room to study. Go to another location and designate it to studying, so you only go there whenever you study. This helps create a routine. 

B)Pomodoro technique. Saved my life. I used the 25 min work 5 min break and I was so much more productive than if I decided to sit in one place for 1.5hrs without using this method. Seriously, it works. 

C) Putting my phone in another room as I worked on my laptop. I eventually started to associate my laptop with work and my phone with play, so even if I watched a couple of YT videos on my laptop it didn't ruin my studying streak. 

D) Naps! I napped every three hours for 10-15 min with soothing music playing in my earphones to lull myself to sleep faster and also 7 alarms set to ensure I'd wake up on time. It helps decrease headaches caused from staring ceaselessly at the PC and also from trying to digest material. I also used to put wet cotton strips over my eyes, which really diminishes the eye pain you get from staring at screens(not just a girly facial mask thing) after leaving it on for 10 ish minutes. 

E) Coffee and tea. Self-explanatory.

F) Getting my 8 hours of sleep. ANYBODY WHO SAYS THEY CAN SURVIVE ON FIVE IS LYING. It should be 6.5-9 hours for everyone. Prolonged sleep deprivation reduces concentration and ability to focus, so when you think you're being more productive cramming late at night, you're actually much less productive. Even if you drink coffee. Get your beauty sleep. 

G) Not cramming! I never created summaries or pretty notes. Instead, I had flashcards that I created and memorised the formula. I revised them periodicially - say I start on the 26. I revise them next on the 27, then 29, then 2, then 6, so on and so forth. Apparently the brain has a forgetfulness curve so you need to target when your memory is weakest. I also used Anki! For more information, look up the explanation behind why Anki is structured the way it is, too long for me to explain. It worked anyway, went from D for last prelim exam to B in H2 chem, like 8 weeks or so apart. So use the flashcard method! You can make it more interesting(and it is generally advised) to associate a concept with a picture or a story, your brain remembers that better. 

H) Exercise when you feel antsy and restless. Restores equilibrium. 

I) Create a general list of tasks to do in the day. Do NOT assign yourself too much stuff. You will just feel demotivated and crash and burn. I had this spreadsheet not of detailed timelines, but general specifics. For example, I need to get Organic Chem Alcohols chapter in flashcards, do the tutorial questions, and any supplementary questions on the school website. Today is Monday. I give myself until Wednesday(or Thursday, if I'm stretching it), to complete this task. I can do everything on Monday or  I can finish it all by Thursday. But I have to do it before Friday. This is much more manageable than 'OMG I HAVE SEVEN HARD THINGS TO DO TODAY LET ME HAVE A MENTAL BREAKDOWN'(yes i have been there lol)

J) Before studying, play a song! Always play the same song. I used to always play Veridis by Daft Punk, then later switched to Conversations by Mac Miller. Any genre. The minute you're done, you grab your books and start studying. 

Also, I used a lot of positive self-talk(you're amazing, can kick this question's ass) even if I didn't necessarily believe it. I mothered myself. It was nice to hear myself say these things about me even if I did not completely believe them to be true(no, I do not have DID). 

On days when you absolutely try EVERYTHING but you still cannot concentrate on anything and just want to stare at the ceiling and cry, you don't touch the books and do something that relaxes you. Speak to your friends. Speak to your family. Make a bomb recipe that you've been wanting to try out(and also eat). You will be back in the game tomorrow and so you will have unfettered freedom this one day. Please do not do this too many times, or use it as an excuse to get out of studying. You will not make it if you do that. 

FINALLY! If you're a perfectionist and cannot bear the thought of failure, remember that you need to fail to succeed. They are two sides of the same coin. You do not magically get good at something. You start from being crummy but you have to work your way up. You cannot just magically arrive at the other end. Life does not work like that. Your failing at something is the pathway to your success, but you must be determined to try and not fall prey to your insecurities. 

That got really philosophical towards the end lol. If anyone has any other suggestions please leave them in the comments! I hope people will find this useful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gqebaz/a_levels_advice_on_how_to_become_motivated_to/,1.0,"[""Thank you for this!

I got in and will start my studies this year if i accept their offer.  NUS and NTU isn't an option since i did not get my first choice for both of these Universities.

During the period of time after i applied for SMU, i encountered many difficulties in my life. It BROKE ME.  I am more afraid than ever. This led me to researching more on SMU to make sure i can survive in University.

After surfing online for info regarding SMU, i realised the Uni adopts a very different teaching style. SMU emphasises on class participation and presentation. Community Service and an overseas stint are mandatory as well. This is my primary concern.

I have low confidence, and thus have difficulty in hands-on learning. I think this is a result of me being bullied since young. I am always afraid and my heart pumps very quickly almost every time. Due to these issues, i have always avoided CCAs and any other non-mandatory activities. I only concentrated in my studies. To make things worst, i may be lacking many life experiences which i should have gone through in my earlier years.

I am very worried that my lack of confidence and lack of practical skills will not only cause me to struggle at SMU, but also affect my relationships with the other students there. Furthermore SMU requires mandatory community service and an overseas stint; how can a person like me, who is  afraid, anxious and probably lack many life skills, gonna survive overseas?

As mentioned, SMU is the only university i can go to now. Therefore i really need advice from the seniors who are reading my post.

Will SMU help me to become a better person? Or will SMU break me? The reason i got good results and am able to get a place in SMU is because i worked very hard in studying. But as time passes by i realised that my practical skills are really not up to par.

I did undergo counselling sessions but they have ended because the counsellors thought i am 'fine' and can cope myself.

I am been dwelling on this issue ever since and got desperate. I did think of SMU as a challenge to overcome my difficulties and ultimately become a more confident person to prepare myself in the working world. But i kept thinking, what if i fail?  In the past, whenever i step out of my comfort zone to try something different, it will backfire most of the time and this just lowers my confidence even more.

I am under a lot of pressure now. Apologies for the long post; just wanted advice from you all on how do i survive in SMU, and will appreciate any tips given to me on how to better cope with university life given my current issues. I really want to study in SMU and get a degree. I only have my results to help me now.

I'm afraid because I feel like I messed up the interview and am so much worse compared to the other students who were there. Throughout the interview my self-esteem really lowered and I was already starting to lose hope.

The thing is, nyjc is the only school I want to go to, and even if I don't DSA, I'd still try my best to JAE to nyjc. I'm not as confident in JAE, and now I don't think my DSA is successful. :/

And I don't know how to deal with this, there are some moments where I really want to give up because of my thoughts. 

My grades have been suffering because of this as I  tend to have very low goals, like oh Atleast ur not getting any Us, good job. I used to be a A student but ever since JC, these thoughts have been pulling me down disabling me from reaching  my real potential ( or if I have any).

Does anyone have any advice or tips to deal with this 😩😩 Im just so tired of feeling this way, feeling like a victim? Inferior? and like an imposter?

Ive recently been struggling alot with H1CL, i realized that i can’t speak during oral practices and tests for sh!t, i can’t write essays in time, even if i did i only get a score around a subpass, and you probably can guess im the guy who doesn’t finish his paper 2 as well. Even though i’m a Chinese Singaporean, i am horrible at my mother tongue. I studied hard (imo) for o level chinese but only managed a b4, and i feel like ive progressively gotten worse at the language (if not very, very tiny improvements in JC). I did not put in effort to learn chinese in the past, only until mid sec 4 did i start to really try to work on it, otherwise i only bothered to do only the bare minimum. My family speaks chinese and english, and most of the time i can only converse in really simple chinese. Right now, in this school, i am at the bottom of the percentile, compared to the rest of the students, if not the very bottom, the worst in the H1CL cohort. I can’t help it but compare myself to the students who are not chinese yet are doing so much better than me, and think about how bad i am at this language. I’ve been trying to work on improving by writing notes in a notebook daily, asking my teachers questions for clarification, tried to watch a few videos in chinese, etc, but i don’t think that i would improve much in the long run, i only have a few months til oral exam then the actual H1CL exam. I have other subjects to work on, and sometimes im left with little time to even study chinese or do my daily note taking. I really don’t know what to do, i want to drop the subject but i don’t think i can. I dont want to retake chinese next year as well. It takes time for me to learn and improve on my other subjects as well, it was a miracle i made it to a good jc, because i think i have some difficulty in learning compared to other jc students (i take large amounts of time to do my work, for example for h2 physics i spend 3hours doing 10 mcqs, for chinese assignments that could be done by other H1CL students in at most 2 hours, i take about 5-7hours doing so, im not lying here, it was just some oral assignment). I really want to give up, i dont have that much time to work with, id rather be working on my social life, gaming, or working on my other subjects. I thouht i could be done with chinese after olevels, but that was not the case, and now im more or less “f*cked” for the rest of the year, if not for next year as well.

TL;DR im really bad at chinese, but dont think i can drop H1CL, am putting in some effort to work on it, but dont think i can improve much. What should i do in this situation? What can i do in this situation? It has taken a toll on my self esteem and motivation as well.

15,SGExams,28705,[A Levels] H2 Literature P3 Mind and Self Plath 'Sheep In Fog',f7tvbk,PhylosophyZM,1582384915,8,1,"(because I crave for attention) What are your thoughts?  
 Sheep in Fog     
The hills step off into whiteness.    
People or stars   
Regard me sadly, I disappoint them.  

The train leaves a line of breath.   
O slow    
Horse the colour of rust,  

Hooves, dolorous bells -   
All morning the   
Morning has been blackening,  

A flower left out.    
My bones hold a stillness, the far   
Fields melt my heart.  

They threaten   
To let me through to a heaven   
Starless and fatherless, a dark water.   


My attempt at a critical appreciation of ‘Sheep In Fog’ 

Plath explores the mind of an isolated speaker with low self-esteem in ‘Sheep in Fog’, presented through the poetic use of setting and imagery. The speaker contemplates eradicating all traces of her self, which is presented as simultaneously ominous and desirable, in response to her perceived inferiority. In essence, Plath captures the complex state of mind of a discouraged individual and leaves us readers to reflect on our own responses towards disappointment.  


Plath portrays a speaker with low self-esteem dealing with disappointment. Considering the active voice of the sentences, the only sentence in the poem with the speaker being the subject depicts a loss of worth: ‘I disappoint them’. Ironically, inanimate objects are personified and are usually the subjects of the sentences, often further lowering the mood of the poem. For instance, they appear to leave the speaker behind, where the hills 'step off' and the train 'leaves'(leaving behind smoke). Also, the stars ‘regard (the speaker) sadly’. The verb 'regard' is distant and depicts others coldly passing judgement on the speaker with detachment, just like the physical proximity of the 'stars'. The title ‘Sheep in Fog’, with the ‘sheep’ being a metaphor for the speaker, degrades the speaker as something unimpressive. This captures the speaker's apparent worthlessness, also by evoking an image of an individual who is obscure and lost, completely engulfed in white, where her identity is indistinguishable. The title is also without any articles which provides neither direction nor specificity, creating that sense of being lost in 'fog'. The poem is thus largely filled with discouragement and loneliness. The visual image of ‘the colour of rust’ is also dejecting, as ‘rust’ is a symbol of deterioration and neglect. Furthermore, the aural imagery of ‘dolorous bells’ is foreboding and depressing which is enhanced by the downbeat, lethargic assonance of the long vowel ‘o’ sound in ‘O slow horse… hooves dolorous bells’ that characterises the speaker’s depressed state of mind. The poem thus illustrates the speaker's emotional state affected by the loss of worth.

Plath further depicts the isolated speaker's complex state of mind, at once lonely, depressed and oddly tranquil, through the setting. The speaker finds herself alone and lost. There is a motif of abandonment where the hills 'step off', the train 'leaves'(leaving behind smoke) and the flower 'left out', movement away which is juxtaposed with the speaker who is discouragingly kept stationary and ‘(her) bones hold a stillness’. The speaker is thus left alone and the speaker's loneliness is emphasised through the vast and expansive rural ‘hills’ and ‘fields’ which are devoid of people. The livestock animals 'sheep' and 'horse' further contribute to the distant, uninhabited rural setting. Yet, the setting is also reminiscent of the pastoral which is associated with tranquility. There is a sense of awe and beauty in how the setting 'melts (her) heart'. It appears that despite being alone, the speaker experiences tinge of freedom from perhaps the expectations placed on her by others and therefore her disappointment. This is further suggested through the fricative consonance that resembles a breeze in ‘A flower left out… the far fields...’ which adds a sense of peace to a phrase depicting emptiness and loneliness. The lighting may seem dark and depressing. It is paradoxical how the ‘morning has been blackening’ which appears to symbolise the absence of hope and happiness, a harbinger for sadness and disaster. Yet, this allows the speaker to efface herself and her identity in complete isolation and obscurity by immersing in ‘dark water’, enabling her to escape judgement and ‘disappoint(ment)’ from the ‘stars’ and others. As a result, there is also a sense of peace felt by the isolated speaker in addition to her loneliness, lethargy and depression, conveyed through the depiction of the setting. 

The speaker contemplates eradicating the self, through fading into obscurity or even death, as a response to disappointment. This is ultimately presented as ambivalent where ominous undertones are present in that which seems to be desirable. The usually positive phrase 'melt my heart' that conveys a sense of awe, is disturbingly associated with foreboding death and the image of decomposition where the 'bones' remain and the tissues 'melt' away decayed. This ambivalence continues with 'heaven' jarringly associated with the unknown, deathly and ominous 'dark water'. The forceful verb 'threaten' conveys a sense of impending doom despite having desirable 'heaven' as a destination. The word 'fatherless' portrays a godless heaven and the internal rhyme of ‘starless and fatherless’ emphasises the suffix ‘-less’ which indicates absence and emptiness, provoking feelings of loneliness in oblivion. This is arguably desirable because there will no longer be the 'stars' to judge her, allowing her to escape disappointment. The stars may symbolise achievement and expectations to attain them (which are perhaps unattainable for the speaker given their distance) and so their effacement is a relief from such pressure to succeed. However, the starless darkness dooms the speaker to being lost forever as the stars are historically used to navigate one's way. It also symbolises the assurance of the speaker’s inability to succeed, just as how death ensures the impossibility of success in the future, ultimately ending the poem with unresolved bleakness. 

Plath manages to depict the multi-faceted state of mind in need of finding escape from disappointment. ‘Sheep in Fog’ is a poem of the loss of worth and we empathise with the speaker in how we base our worth on the judgement of others, how disappointment is emotionally taxing on the mind and how in extreme cases, death is considered a possibility for escape. The speaker, living a life feeling worthless, seems to consider death as a means to efface her self along with the pressures to succeed. It is haunting to read this poem with the knowledge of Plath’s depression and suicidal tendencies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f7tvbk/a_levels_h2_literature_p3_mind_and_self_plath/,0.0,"[""I didn't take lit but I think it's good""]"

i created a throwaway account to post this haha jic some of my friends can recognise me from my username.

I'm taking my a levels this year but i feel like I'm losing the motivation to do everything. not only have i lost my focus in school, i lost interest in everything i used to love doing. i feel like i have nothing to look forward to anymore and i constantly feel so lost and helpless? and I've been dealing with lots of family issues since a few years back and it involves a family member and mental illnesses and as a result, kinda traumatised me and scarred me. everytime i feel like things are getting better, it's always the calm before the storm. and also I'm currently dealing with a lot of self-esteem issues and i have really bad social anxiety so sch really sucks for me too. sometimes i feel like I'm always there for everyone but when i need help, i feel like I'm bothering my friends and spreading negativity to them so I don't really tell them about what's going on in my life and all. and last year was a pretty bad year for me too because pw really sucked up all my energy and i kinda had to tank most of it because my grp mates think i very 好欺负 hahaha and because I lack confidence, i couldn't really stand up for myself too. and tbh that's how most people view me too. so sometimes I don't think everyone ever treats me genuinely because they take me as a fool and think I'm okay and alright with whatever they do. 

so I don't really have a place i can go?? like a place where i feel safe in. I don't wanna stay in school aft sch because i don't really like seeing people neither do i wanna stay at home because of everything that's happening at home now. my whole family is just falling apart and that really hurts me because i don't know what to do. I'm the youngest in my family and it feels like no one ever considers about my feelings tbh. 

I don't know how to survive this year because i know it's gonna be a very tough year since I'm taking As but i don't have the motivation to do anything anymore. i just cry myself to sleep almost every night and wake up feeling better and then the whole cycle repeats itself. does anyone know how i can cope with this? and how i can focus and concentrate more on my studies with all this going on in my life? 😭😭😩 i can't even focus on my work at home with all the arguing and screaming. 

sorry for ranting so much and thank u so much if u read this whole thing ❤️ i just don't know where else to post this because I can't really tell anyone about it.

17,SGExams,28365,[META] There's always someone better than you.,f6vb3h,ongbluey123,1582215212,2,1,"## This post is dedicated to all those who are receiving their A Level results today. For everyone else, maybe you’ll find it relevant too!

&amp;#x200B;

\\\\ From young, we’ve always had this competitive mindset drilled into us – we are constantly comparing our achievements with our peers. You want to be the cream of the crop – you want to be better than your peers, your siblings, your relatives – basically everyone else. Truthfully, who doesn’t? 

\\\\ In a highly competitive education system (like that of ours) – it seems like the only way to succeed is to do better than our peers, which inevitably gives rise to our competitive nature. More often than not, we end up feeling inferior compared to our peers. Why am I not in a better school? Why am I as smart as my classmates? Most of us have been there – we constantly feel second to the people around us, which leads to a constant pressure on ourselves to outdo others. That’s fine, it’s what pushes us to become a better version of ourselves every day.

\\\\ However, often, in the midst of all this stress, our perception gets clouded. We get so caught up with doing better than others, we fail to see the good in ourselves. Think of it as attribute points in RPGs. The distribution of the ‘points’ are different for each and every one of us. Some of us here excel as athletes. Some of us here excel as leaders. Some of us here excel in academics. Take a step back, reflect on your own strengths and weaknesses, or even, ask your friends and family about it – you’ll realise there’s more good in yourself than you’ve ever noticed.

\\\\ There’s more to life than excelling academically. Just to name a few: There’s the social aspect of life – the community around you, your friends, your family. There’s the personal aspect of life – your own character, your personal physical health. There’s the emotional aspect of life – your own mental health, your self-esteem. It’s absolutely alright for you not to excel at every aspect of life, there’s always another aspect that’ll more than make up for it. There’s always someone out there that’s better than you in one aspect, but there’s another aspect of yourself that’ll make up for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: It really doesn’t matter if there’s someone out there that’s better than you (there always is) – what truly matters is: you are a better version of yourself today than yesterday. Your grades don’t define who you are. Appreciate yourself and the people around you

To everyone receiving your results – All the best – no matter your results, don’t give up – life doesn’t stop here. You will only get an opportunity to succeed if you try,

20,SGExams,46714,[O Levels] My fears and expectations are holding me back from studying,iqnmsl,starfuckeryy,1599818433,8,1,"Context: I am in Secondary 2 and this year is my streaming year, so I'm quite anxious about my EOYs. I come from an average neighborhood school (the cutoff is around 230+) and the teachers there don't put excessive pressure on us to excel or anything. I also have extremely low self-esteem. 

Problem: My fixed mindset is preventing me from doing anything. It's been like this since July: I've been procrastinating on homework and studying for tests, and I've resorted to cheating (asking my friends which questions/topics will come out in the tests because I procrastinated and didn't have even time to study). 

The September break is nearly over and I've barely touched my homework and I haven't started studying at all. I think this is due to a few reasons: 

1) My mind tells me that there's no point in trying because I'll fail over and over again, so I can't be bothered with school at all despite knowing how important it is. It also makes me think that I'll never be able to improve and get better at my subjects. Therefore, I have no motivation at all. 

2) Since I've been procrastinating a lot, there's so much work I have to catch up on. The stress from the sheer amount of work I have to do paralyzes me, and I feel too stressed to do anything productive. This leads to me lying on bed using my phone all day. 

3) I place high expectations on myself (i.e. expecting myself to get at least an A2 for all of my subjects), and the fear of not meeting them makes me anxious, which also paralyzes me and prevents me from doing anything.  

I'm aware that this is a vicious cycle of me not wanting to try so I can avoid disappointing myself, then failing to meet my expectations and lastly feeling like a complete and utter failure and disappointment, causing me to not want to try.

 I have no idea how to break out of this cycle, and it's stressing me out even more because I know I need to snap out of this stupid funk in order to do well for my EOYs, and if I don't I'm not going to get the subject combination of my choice. I feel like I'm a hopeless case at this point. I'm super desperate for advice, so if you have any, please comment. 

tl;dr I haven't done any work for eoys due to procrastination and high expectations of myself, so i'm stuck in a vicious cycle of self hatred and even more procrastination. I don't know how to snap out of it, so any advice would be really appreciated.

It’s okay to lose motivation to study sometimes. Studying can be a very demoralising activity sometimes I admit haha. But there are always ways to motivate yourself to keep studying! Firstly, set some goals for yourself. What subject combination do you plan to take next year? Triple science? Double sconce? Coursework? Double humanities? Maybe write it down on a piece of paper somewhere and put it up at your study table. Whenever you look at it, you might feel more motivated to study. Secondly, reward yourselves whenever you’ve done well for something. For example, you’re doing your TYS and when you tabulate your marks, you got an A1/A2. Reward yourselves with your favourite snacks or family time could be a very rewarding activity as well. It depends on what you prefer lah haha. Thirdly, try to use the pomodoro technique to study. It’s either you study for 25 mins then take a break for 5 mins or you study for 50 mins then take a break for 10mins. (I personally prefer the 50mins one because 25 mins is too short for me but it could be subjective) Studying for long periods of time can be a really exhausting and tedious process so make sure that you take breaks in the midst of studying! Of course, this list is not exhaustive and there are other ways to motivate yourselves when you feel demoralised.

I wished I dropped some of my subjects last year, but I wanted to prove to my teachers that I could excel. My subject combination is KILLING ME. I take Pure Chem &amp; Bio, Pure Literature, Amath, Emath and SS+History (since MT's over, I'm not taking it anymore). 

I'm a professional when it comes to failing ALL MY DOUBLE SCIENCES and AMATH. 

Please help folks, my sciences are driving me nuts. I understand my concepts well but can't seem to differentiate the types of questions that they ask, i.e., 'describe the trend of the graph', 'state the trend of the graph'. I haven't been doing much of TYS, but I did tons of my school's practice papers - and I can do them! So why does my mind go blank during exams?

AMATH! The bane of my very existence. It makes me want to lie on the floor and wiggle like a snake as I cry my heart out. I CAN'T GET ANYTHING RIGHT. Here's this stupid thing, if I can't get my differentiation right, say bye-bye to integration, say bye-bye to area under the graph. I keep trying my papers, look through my school notes. Nothing is entering my brain. And tomorrow's my paper! 

I'm frustrated with myself. I get As and some subjects with B3s, and then, when I read a little lower on my report card, all I see are E8s and F9s. This is detrimental to me. WHY AM I CURSED WITH BEING EXCELLENT IN MY HUMANITIES AND ENGLISH? Why can't I deal with science &amp; amath well? My friends can do it. Is there something wrong with me? :(

I'm not getting the results that my teachers want, and I got into trouble for that.

I'm sure that due to moderation/bellcurve, there will definitely be a different range of scores to qualify for an a1 in english, but i'm extremely uncertain and doubtful about my own estimates. Given that literally 3 people in my cohort got 75+ for english prelim, i'm hoping that this is a common trend for most other schools and the bellcurve/moderation for O Level English will be lower. On the other hand, people have told me that english is actually one of the easier subjects (i beg to differ) so the a1 benchmark is actually higher than 75. Literally got 76-78% for all my english exams (with a good oral score), doubtful that i can do the same for Os because i got off to a horrendous start with Oral.

I believe that there is light at the end of every tunnel. some of us may be having it tough, facing setbacks pertaining to relationships, physical or mental health, the stress from academics, losing hope, addiction, expectations, perhaps not meeting them, low self-esteem, maybe one, maybe all. sometimes the only way out is to brave through the storms even if we don’t want it that way. when things get overwhelming, just remember that your clouds will always pass, and you will always feel the sunshine again🥰 

it is perfectly alright to take things at your own pace; building on yourself and accepting yourself and your progress. you are special, worthy and there are so many hidden, wonderful things about you that you have simply never heard anyone say out aloud! you are your perfect

find your passions, focus on them. look for your short-term and long-term goals, work on achieving them. all this not for others but yourself! never give up on what you love and what you dream of. with a positive mindset, take in every moment you experience and remember that failures are never setbacks :)

there is always a way to lessen your emotional burden. personally, these are the things I do when I am stressed or under pressure. I silently reflect as it is a form of self-motivation for me. I also confide in my boyfriend and best friends (whom I am incredibly grateful for) and being religious, I pray to god for strength to carry on in whatever it is that I am doing. we live as individuals but we don’t live by ourselves. similarly, we never have to go through our problems by ourselves.

24,SGExams,49844,[A levels] advice on how to study with negative mental health,j953es,tinkingthings,1602421602,9,1,"I’m a J2 student and it’s only a month away from A levels for me. I’m the kind of person that tends to be very critical to myself, low self-esteem and basically downplay a lot of things I experience, which is not great. So I end up feeling emotionally numb, melancholic, or both, quite regularly. Occasionally, I panic / get anxious very suddenly and intensively for like a few hours. These emotional occurrences have been cultivated and intensified in me through many factors in my house. It probably started way back in primary school but worsened every year due to increasing stress &amp; workload. I don’t have a terrible relationship with my parents but they perpetuate a lot of the negative things I end up feeling towards myself. I don’t like staying at home because I never really feel at ease with myself or feel comfortable with sharing about myself.  So my whole mental health state really took a huge plunge because of the whole circuit breaker + final year in JC / preparation for A’s. 

I’ve started thinking of going to a therapist on my own after A’s, without letting my parents know, like a few months back. And I thought I could wait till then too but I think the emotional spirals are becoming more frequent and uncontrollable. Like I tend to feel overwhelming emotional numbness &amp; melancholy on weekends, almost every week. Even on weekdays sometimes I get stuck in a loop of emotions. Usually when I spiral down / get stuck, it could take me like from a few hours to a whole day to “get over it” and function or do things I want to do. My friend recommended me to check out CHAT, which I did, but they didn’t have any available slots for Oct &amp; Nov so I don’t know how soon I can check in with them. I was looking for CHAT as my source of temporary relief before A’s but now I’m not sure if that would be possible. Besides that, my emotional support in the family would be “missing” really soon because my older sibling is gonna be enlisting. 

I guess I just want to say that I’m just really worried that my emotions will intensify with me having no one to depend on. And if that happens before A’s I fear I’ll do poorly / fail because these emotions, which I had for years (but only worsened this year), always stops me from studying because I feel too much. I genuinely worry that if I do fail A’s, I might end up sinking too deep into my negative emotions and not be able to come out of it, which is already an issue I struggle with periodically this year. Any advice on what I should do to keep my mental health at bay but not put additional stress on myself? And also how I could bring myself to study with my current mental health state? I appreciate anything concrete at this point, I just want to study and do decent:/ And I’m so sorry if this whole situation sounds so confusing, I’m trying to understand myself as well:”",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j953es/a_levels_advice_on_how_to_study_with_negative/,1.0,"['Still got time, there\'s the school counselor(just say you wanna see them privately) that you gotta see before A\'s(a few hours isn\'t much). They\'re willing even after ""graduation"". Call your teachers too. They know how to keep it private. \n\nAlso, you can call counselors, so maybe say to your parents you\'re going out to do something or wait till they leave for like lunch.\n\nAlso, music really helps. Just on it and study, and study. Don\'t care about your grades now or how well you do with the practice papers cause it\'s one step at a time. \n\nWhile the first two weeks(i think) of enlistment you prob. can\'t keep in close contact, after that your sibling should be alright with you frequently calling them and messaging them over whatsapp. But for now just talk with your sibling and tell them to keep it private. They\'re willing to listen to you rant even if they don\'t have advice, so might as well get it all out first.\n\nDon\'t try to suppress your emotions, cause your exam is not tmr it is like maybe 9-19 days away which is good enough.\n\nAs long as you study you should get good grades. So don\'t bother worrying and stuff, just do it and have no regrets after.\n\nI would suggest getting into a routine, even if you\'re emotionally numb you can get better just by doing practice papers, like they really take your focus away from bad stuff.\n\nAgain, music is important. Just get the kind you like and plug it in like half the day.\n\nEven if you\'re feeling bad, like real bad, either go to sleep for an hour or continue your routine. Don\'t sit on the couch lying around for it to go away. Just doing the routine of studies can make you feel better.\n\nAlso consults, they\'re really useful.

25,SGExams,49545,[RANT] Something is really wrong with our education system,j7dwwr,XoridusX,1602166934,4,1,"Hello. Im not a frequent poster on reddit but i thought this needed to be said, and after looking through many many posts on this subreddit i think (?) that many of you feel the same way and honestly we should maybe try and do something about it. Or something. Idk. You know what I'm just going to share about my experience and what ive seen and witnessed since the start of my life and how I was impacted growing up in this country and you guys can decide if you agree or not.
(Major trigger warning for like mental health things)

Did you know when was my first exam?
Kindergarten 2.
Maybe even earlier, but thats the extent of my memory. 
From the young age of 5 or 6 years old I was thrust head first into a world of assessment books, into the unforgiving world of tests and exams.
I remember being so confused sitting in my classroom, the room nearly dead silent. Where had all the energy from my classmates gone? Boisterous and loud boys and girls were now sitting silently at the desk, scribbling away at the test paper in front of us.
Anyone who made noise was scolded, the room was freezing, our normally cheerful and kind teacher was no longer smiling. All in all it was a pretty hostile environment for a child.
I remember receiving my results. I remember doing okay on spelling, but many of my classmates were all in tears over their failure.
This scene stuck with me. Normally bright and smiling children all crying over a piece of paper.
You know what happened after this? My family migrated to Australia. And compared to Singapore honestly, it felt like paradise. I was probably too young to really know anything but even now I can recall that my 1 year in Australia really made an impression on me. I honestly love the country. We read books for homework, spent many a lesson on art and they even thought us how to use a computer. I remember growing vegetables in the school garden! 
And most of all, I don't remember taking many tests. Most of the ""evaluations"" the teachers made were more on our attitude and how we interacted with the other students.
I had an amazing time there. I will always look back with fondness on my time in Australia.
Then there were family problems and I moved back to Singapore. 
Immediately, I felt a strange sense of sadness and longing. Primary 2 in Junyuan was a far far cry from Australia. The teachers were harsher, the number of tests increased. The environment was much stricter, and I had my first real taste of bullying. Life was alot less fun.
But, thanks to the constant stream of assessment books I did while I was in Australia (My parents found their education system ""lacking"") I was way ahead of most of my peers. I landed 2nd in my level that year, and was boosted to the best class. Then i scored 1st in level in primary 3, and I made it through the GEP exams. My parents were pretty ecstatic, but I still remember being scolded for the careless mistakes I made on my final year exam. (I got one question wrong. In the entire paper.)
Anyway things were looking up. I was headed towards a new school, again, in what was supposedly a pretty ""elite"" program (in case you're wondering, its not)

My life only went downhill from there.

I struggled with grades in primary 4 to 6. There were many internal problems in my class and most of my classmates despised me (I was a tad too eager to be popular and ended up being the complete opposite)
St Hildas was a good school. But even then there was alot of discrimination towards my class, for apparently being ""smarter"" than everyone else, which further ostracised us from the rest of the school body, which made them think that we thought we were too good to hang out with them and the misunderstandings kept increasing. I never felt or acted like I  was elite, but suddenly to everyone else i was an elitist. I was not. I was lowest in class. What the heck are yall talking about? Damn im only 10 years old and this kind of inner school politics shize is happening.
Honestly here's the thing about elitism. Sometimes, its really not their fault. For me, it was really because of the environment i grew up in. I didn't look down on anyone, I never felt I was better than others but all the way up till secondary 4, I never even knew N levels existed. Because to the people around me, it was never a possibility that I would end up on that route. My whole future was planned for me. Top schools, top courses, top everything. There was never a thought of ""what if I fail?"" Everyone expected me to be the best, to be perfect, and in the end that kind of thinking really engraves itself into you until you start thinking its natural to be perfect and do well and when you don't you hate yourself for it. But failure is natural. Failure does happen. No one is perfect. I really didnt learn that until secondary 4, and by then, it was too late. I'll elaborate more on this later.
So, after much ostracization (even from my own classmates), bullying and pressure and stress throughout my primary school gep journey I decided to give absolutely no care to my PSLE and just wing it. I'd kind of given up by that point. I even considered just shooting myself in Primary 5 until I found out Singapore really didnt have any guns.
Can you guess what I got for PSLE?
252.
And I was in tears.
I thought i had barely passed.
I was led to believe 250 was the passing mark for PSLE and honestly everyone in my class scored higher than me so to me it really seemed like it was. And due to my lack of interaction with the other students in the school I didnt know anything outside my small circle of elite classmates.
I broke down receiving my results. I was devastated. I didnt meet the criteria to get into RI, and my dsa was a flaming wreckage because im socially anxious and prone to awkwardness. 
Ok, fine you can laugh at me. But almost all of the guys in my class were going to RI, and I knew pretty much no one outside of that circle. To me, I was a complete and utter failure. Then after that my parents showed me a really long list of schools and I realised RI isn't the only secondary school in Singapore.
I was still only given two choices tho. ACSI or NUS High.
I chose the AC
And honestly, I feel like it was a good decision. Sure, my story ends pretty badly but you know what I enjoyed the environment, and the people in my school. Teachers were good, other students were really mature and understanding (this is a lie for the first half of secondary school but they get better) and all in all things were pretty chill.
Thats a big fat lie. People aside, life sucked.
I had so so many problems and stresses. Firstly, I was in MEP. For those of you not musically inclined its basically O level Music. Just so you know, im not musically inclined either but somehow my mum asked me to try it out just for fun and i magically got in and they were so proud of me and I didnt want to ruin their expectations so I kept at it. It sucked. Imagine being tone deaf and grade 1 piano in a room of diploma musicians. It made me feel like the dumbest human in existence. My self esteem plummeted into oblivion. Honestly, the teachers were really good at their job and MEP was fun IF you are good at music.
I was not.
It was hell.
And I kinda sucked at everything about music.
I tried to quit in sec 1, but my parents were so supportive i just couldnt bear to disappoint them so I dragged my ass through it. 
In the meantime, life went on. 2 gruelling ccas, being in a class where everyone is smarter than you, not being popular, etc etc.
Sec 2 I developed depression, or at least I think I did.
I tried to tell my dad, but he thought i was being ""oversensitive"" and said i didnt know what real depression was like.
Well I sure showed him!
Anyway
Secondary 3, after only barely managing to survive the two previous years, I decided to do something I hadn't done in a really long time. Study.
I never had the confidence to, but I thought that hey, this is my chance to turn my life around!
It didnt work out.
I overdosed on coffee, landed myself in the hospital for exhaustion around like august, and come final years, I didnt learn my lesson. Day of the exam, I was without sleep for many days and my bloodstream had more coffee than blood. As you can guess, I fell asleep during almost all my papers and failed 2 of them.
When the results came back, all I felt, was hate.
For myself.
Nothing else mattered, I put in effort for the first time in forever, and i performed worse than ever before. 
I was disgusted at my own uselessness.
Everything came back to one point
I was raised to be perfect.
Everyone told me I was, everyone expected me to be, everyone was disappointed in me when i wasnt.
I was disappointed in myself.
I hated myself.
I hated everything.
There was no way out. Studying and the school system and the education track is all ive ever known. I didnt know of any other path. 
I tried to see a counsellor, it didnt work. I tried to tell my teachers, still didnt work. Too little, too late.

I ended up on a ledge, start of sec 4, ready to end my life.

So, why did i write this? Why am I sharing? What do I hope to gain from this?
Nothing honestly, its called a rant.
But i want you to try and see how everything fell apart, all the way from the start.
The existence of exams is seriously a curse.
Even if they perform well and you praise them, it creates a subtle pressure that they have to continue to do the same, which obviously they cant, they will eventually fail.
The early years is a very very important period of time, and we should be using it to get children to learn to accept failure, but instead mine were spent learning about how the world was a horrible place where little numbers on paper decided whether you were worth anything or not.
Honestly many people talk about this already, and I hear it everywhere I go. But then why is no one doing anything about it?
Did you know? I've got 140 IQ according to an official test i took. But i still feel like the dumbest trash in existence. How did it come to this?
Why is our environment and system such shit?
Why is this still happening?
Why do I see this everywhere?

Im really really glad that Singapore has worked really hard on the mental health front and that things have improved, slightly, for one i will no longer be arrested for attempting to kill myself.
By the way that was not fun and I seriously question why the police put a 16 year old kid who had just attempted to end his life in a holding cell for more than 8 hours instead of sending him to a hospital.
But thats another topic
Im just really upset. I dont want my sister to end up like me. Even now, after i dropped out of school, I still see no hope. I still see no future. The rock solid foundation of education is everything still exists in me and the failure still weighs me down. 2 years after I dropped out. Ive tried many times to return to normality and get back and do O levels or something but you know what? I can't. My brain is filled with self hatred. My self esteem is a black hole. Ive no motivation, no hope, nothing.
Just please.
I used to be happy.
I used to be an innocent kid, filled with hope and joy.
Dont let my sister end up like me.
Dont let other children end up like me.
Mental health awareness is good and all but prevention is better than cure. Many students still face unbearable stress and pressure everyday. I think its better to deal with that rather than the depression that develops as a result of that (not that im saying its not important to ""cure"" or 'fix' depression more like its better to address the stress that causes it. ((Not that im saying stress is the only cause of depression its just one of the possible causes and factors that is widespread and present in most students)))
I dont know if its even possible to fix this. Probably not. Does anything Im saying make sense to anyone? Is it cuz i missed my meds? Am i just being stupid on a subreddit? Is everyone going to think im insane? Am I just rambling about my own problems like a self centered stupid attention seeking idiot like everyone thinks I am?
Maybe the problem is not the system its just me?
Maybe im just being really stupid?
Maybe i was just really unlucky?
Maybe.
Maybe so.
But before i become just another blip of a statistic on suicide rates among teenagers, I wanted to share this.
Please don't make more people end up like me.
No one should have to go through this suffering.
No one should feel like this.
No one should have to die because of this.
Please do something.
And if you've read till here, thank u for sticking with my madness. Ive probably lost it halfway through and im not making sense anymore.
Also seriously, with all the stress from exams and shit already weighing down on everyone, please dont be a jerk. And teachers, please be nicer to your students.
If you have a friend, who you think is going through bad times, please reach out to them before its too late.
If you are going through bad times, i feel for you. Please hold on. There's still hope for you. Maybe this post will change something? Maybe??? Hopefully???
Nah.
But still I beg of you, hold on.
There will be change. Eventually.
Until then, hold on please.

I would say im more of a sports person and i actually enjoy playing sports. Yet i went to choose a club instead. Interact club. This is just my personal opnion but i dont really enjoy being in this cca. Why?

1. I thought that joining a sports cca would have been too stressful with all the competitions and my school work would be affected, but who would have thought covid would suspend ccas? If i had knew that ccas would be cancelled for a period of time, i would have probably chosen to join a sports cca instead.

2. However shallow this may seem, i only joined interact club to beef up my portfolio. I don't really think i have the heart to serve others... But now that i think about it, i think results take priority anyway.

3. Well, u could call it fomo. Because my friend was choosing interact club as her cca, it also influenced my decision. Im not a social butterfly so i wanted to stick with her, but i didnt think that we would end up in different groups. So yes, i was forced to make new friends in the end.

Ive also heard people say that clubs are ""inferior"". I don't want to be classified as the nerdy or lame kid. I really want to change cca. To something i will actually enjoy taking part in. But i dont think its possible anymore since j1 is ending. And i also don't want to start all over again.

Maybe im adopting the wrong (and unhealthy?) mindset about my current cca. But i get soo jealous when i see the other sports cca enjoying themselves.

27,SGExams,47771,[Poly] Year 3 Poly Blues // Can I still go to Uni with mediocre portfolio &amp; gpa?,iyulus,rysmald,1600942826,3,1,"
Hi hi! So I’m a 3rd year student in poly in computer engineering and I’ve recently gotten back my Y3S1 results, cGPA 3.446. I don’t know if I’m just over reacting saying that 3.446 is low but it feels low to me and most of the people around me have much better GPAs. :( 3.7 to 3.8 and whatnot. 


I started Y1 quite strong with a 3.75 GPA but quickly got overwhelmed by all the extra activities I took (D+, tutoring, CCAs, doing school events) &amp; some family issues that it dropped to 3.506 by the end of Year 2. Seeing that made me desperate to study harder so I did all this planning and goal setting and taking more modules to increase my GPA but alas, covid came.


At the start of Y3 I was doing fine but I guess the covid stress and the fact that I hated studying at home (mostly used to studying outside, home environment isn’t the best) made me reluctant to study and once I got my mid term results I just felt so hopeless cause it wasn’t as high as I wanted to and it soon became this cycle of me being too depressed to do any school work and ignoring most of my duties, loosing my self-esteem and then the usual weekly quiz will come along and I would have this mini hope that maybe I’m just over thinking stuff, study them, don’t do well for them and then become more sad and dead inside.


The fact that most of our projects became individual and the assessment contribution of projects increased didn’t help as I absolutely sucked at projects. I had the ego of a donkey and the social skills of a fish, making me reluctant to want to ask for help at all just contributing more and more to that cycle and yeah. Managed to submit the projects in time but most of them weren’t even half finished, I rather lose face and be shamed rather than submit late when I know that even with extra time, there wouldn’t be much difference in the quality of work.


I don’t have that good of a portfolio, it’s above average at best so I’m not sure if I’ll be able to enter Uni using ABA since I’ve read that you need to globally represent your country/school and stuff and the best I did was enter finalist at a hackathon with my friends. I mean, I guess scholarship counts? But it’s easily attainable and I don’t understand it’s value for after poly other than it being helpful in terms of money during poly.




I’m hoping for NTU/NUS as much as possible, and I’m even considering a change in field of study - just that was worried if there is even a chance for me to enter Uni without much redeeming qualities? :( Especially since the IGP for both unis are like 3.5 and above. 




(Ps. Was browsing internet and happened upon this reddit thread and while searching about school stuff and figured there would be no harm to join &amp; ask here instead lol)

In my lower Secondary School years, I was constantly ignored by my classmates and sometimes even made fun of by my classmates and sometimes even bullied. I used to be like some of you guys out there, affected by these comments and feel down and low. I understand that you may feel unhappy, disappointed, angry that these people are being toxic to you. JUST IGNORE THEM! WHAT DOESN""T KILL YOU, MAKES YOU STRONGER!! Choose to ignore them. Even if the whole class hates you, just choose to ignore them and continue to lead you life, proud and confident. Raise your self esteem. If you are like me, bullied in my lower Secondary School Years for having a different mindset, being different, just remember there are people out there like yo. JUST IGNORE THEIR COMMENTS AND DON""T CARE. I understand also that you may be triggered. Keep your ego down. I will honestly say this, in my lower sec years, I had a completely different ambition from the others and was laughed at, friends did not respect me. Some called me stupid, some called me retarded, some called me a bitch. BUT LATER ON, I chose to ignore these COMMENTS and continued to lead my life. To those facing toxicness from friends or friends verbally abusing you, stay away from these people and ignore them. DEVELOP what you can do along the way, and i assure you when you become good at something, they will respect you.

To those out there, I just want to say, accept criticisms. If someone criticises you for your ambition or what you are doing now, they are probably jealous. Don't let these comments affect you and continue what you are good at. People will be jealous at something you do, they will even hate you when you achieved what you want. Just ignore and lead your life at what are your ambitions or if you want to learn a new skill, learn it.

To those out there, revising O levels, this is the last lap and put all your efforts. DO your tys, DO your past year papers, DO your work now. FULLY IMMERSE YOURSELVES IN THIS EXAMS.

I always see myself as a failure until now coz I was absolutely trash at studies and rarely had motivation to do well in the past. This snowballed till I finished my sec sch, and I flunked my O levels due to lack of motivation and being greatly affected by what others said badly of me. Then I was unable to enter JC due to my poor results and had to enter MI instead. I felt that I was very useless coz many of my other schoolmates went to JC, and me this stupid kid entered MI instead. Then when I entered MI, I made a bold decision to change my own attitudes towards studies and as a result, I was in the top 5% of my cohort. However, I still feel very useless and weak coz I know I’m in MI and many ppl will look down at me. What makes things worse is that I am told that I’m too harsh on myself. Yes I started to catch up and put in effort to do (relatively) well in my studies since I entered MI but this makes me feel even more stressful and still feel like a failure.

One time when I talked about how badly I did for my O levels and decided to change my attitudes towards studies, my teacher told me that it was due to ‘late bloomer syndrome’. I felt that it was true, but this made me feel even worse as ‘late bloomer syndrome’ is cancerous. It just torture you in the past and this makes me have trauma about my shitty past till now. I always ask myself, “Why was I so lousy and had to experience all these ‘tortures’ in the past??” This made me have very low self-esteem until now.
Is there anything that can help me erase my past and improve my impression on others?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jy75ok/rant_low_confidence_in_myself/,0.99,"['the past is the past, i’ve had friends who went to MI to study as well. but it’s really not a big deal if you end up in your dream course (if you wna go uni). most of my uni friends don’t even care about each other’s backgrounds. if people know that you take the long route, you’d get more praises tbh, for making it this far. you might take longer, you might be a late bloomer, but you’ll learn valuable lessons along the way that people might not learn. don’t be too hard on yourself.']"
30,SGExams,57748,[A Levels] A thank you to r/SGExams,jx328q,TheJusticeAvenger,1605794020,3,1,"Hi everyone! I'm a J2 student who just finished As yesterday (weird arts combi gang lmao) so I just felt like saying a big thank you to this sub for keeping me going for the past few months.

It had been a pretty stressful period for me for the past 9 weeks or so since the end of my prelims. As had always seemed so far, but with it creeping closer and closer day by day, the pressure was admittedly getting to me. My prelims results weren't exactly stellar either, which worsened my self-esteem issues. I inexplicably found myself on this sub, where I remember spending days trying to read all the A Levels flaired-posts.

Was I seeking advice? Validation? Some kind of universality to my experiences? To be honest, I don't really remember. What I do remember, however, is how encouraging this community was. It wasn't uncommon to see posts about people feeling anxious, worried, burnt out or just straight up demoralised, but the comment sections were always filled with encouraging messages and advice that truly, um, ""warmed the cockles of my heart"". Though I wasn't usually the one requiring advice, I really felt a sense of community within this subreddit. In fact, I felt compelled to give advice and share my own experiences as well, something I hadn't intended to do (or expected to be in any position to in the first place).

At the end of it all, I just want to reiterate my thanks for this sub really helping me to get through the most challenging part of my JC experience. Y'all helped me to persevere through the pain and I couldn't be more grateful for having made it this far. And for those who are still taking As: don't give up just yet! You're almost at your destination, you just gotta hold on and keep fighting. I wish you all nothing but the best for your remaining papers, and I hope you'll come out of them with no regrets just like I've done with mine.

What's the point of comparing questions? What's the point or arguing over a 1 mark question when, News Flash, none of y'all are right. 

This is not only impractical, but stupid for several reasons:

1. Firstly, knowing you lost marks to some questions is only going to demotivate and demoralise yourself. Your self esteem is already low enough, do you really want to make it lower than it already it? And now you're going to go into future papers but your mind is still thinking about the sheeps from H2 Maths. 

2. Secondly, there's literally no point in comparing answers, it's not like you can go back and change your answers anyway. We get it, you wrote x=2, so what? Can we magically change it to x=3 by talking about that question? 

3. Thirdly, it's only going to feed those trolls with severe superiority complexes knowing that they got a question right and you didn't. Look at it this way, you get a difficult question right, nobody else did, but you don't want to seem like that flexer so you wait for your victim to ask about that question before you come full flex mode about how ""Ohh that question was easy."" Now imagine you're on the receiving end of that. 

What's the point of comparing answers? What's over is over, what's ahead is what's left. 以前是以前，现在是现在. Playing mind games with yourself is a sure fail way to bring yourself down.

For some context, im from an above mid (lmao idk how yall classify) sch but I’ve been struggling since the very first day ... and honestly lol dk how i even got into this sch bc i was alr struggling back in sec sch haha... 

anw its really been a constant struggle of comparing myself to everyone else every!single!day! and feeling like the shittiest person ever. This year was especially so hard and it was honestly tough to drag myself to school and be around my high flying classmates who excel while i come out at the bottom of the class haha.  I fully admit this is one of the worst mindsets that you could be in and really i guess it was my fault, but the more tests and exams we did, the further i fell into the hole of self doubt and my self esteem spiralled. Things we did in class, i took twice the time as others. Concepts were a struggle to understand. Even the people who were “at my standard” started to progress and went well beyond me. I tried so hard to convince myself that i am not stupid and to try harder because effort=results. Countless consults and hours of studying and what i get is a bunch of papers that i messed up. Even the people who try to comfort me by saying they’ll do as bad as me didn’t even mess up. Initially told myself that im ok with my results but the more i think about how EVERYONE around me are going to get &gt;85 rp while im just expecting a whole 10rp below them makes me so uncomfortable because why do i have to settle for less? When did i start being okay with less. When did i start putting myself down so much? I know there are so many other paths in life and results don’t define everything. But in this education system, i just cannot fully believe that. 

The worst of all this is that i feel like I’ve let myself down the most and im not proud of what I’ve achieved thus far. I guess the fact is that despite putting myself down so much the entire 2 years, at the back of my mind, i wanted to improve so desperately and do as well as everyone else but it was just futile. Maybe i could have studied harder. Maybe if I hadn’t convinced myself i was stupid, I’d have done alot better. In some ways i guess it just became a self fulfilling prophecy... but i seriously tried to suck it up and studied my best for As but rly lol it was a shitshow. Im just so sick at having to settle for less and not being able be on the level as my counterparts in jc. 

Honestly reading this.... im disgusted at what ive been telling myself and im tired of this. Its so so so draining but at least i got it out.

O levels is over. From now on there'll be no sunshine and rainbows. 

You either go jc and let the huge workload and many fails crush your self esteem or go poly and deal with slackers for your group mates.

Then you go to uni . Rinse, repeat.
 
You step into the work force, be a slave to capitalism and deal with tiresome and cumbersome things like how to open a bank account and transfer your money to another person from another bank but you have to do it online but it still fails after one hour for god knows what reason.

Then you have a child! Congratulations!

38,SGExams,9427,[Poly] PFP or Sec 5,am3bkm,t_rcs,1549036003,6,1,"My sister scored 19\_ during PSLE so she only *just* didn't make it into express. She's in NA now and has been thriving; top of level and all that. I believe she really has the potential to do even better since her past failures have spurred her on to study diligently (&amp; literally every minute!!!! what even...) i.e. work hard enough to get into JC (albeit a mid-tier one, that is good enough) but being in NA has screwed up her self esteem &amp; mindset. She believes it such a wide gap between sec 4 NA &amp; sec 5 and therefore doesn't want to take the leap.

As such, she says she wants to do PFP. Personally I am lowkey against this because I have that traditional mindset that poly is bad. I know this isn't 100% true. But I know of so many poly dropouts, plus the percentage of those who enter university after poly are low.Plus its harder to do so as a poly student. I Furthermore my poly friends constantly complain about constant projects (is poly therefore unadvisable for my sister since she hates public speaking?) + everything being weighted.  don't know much about PFP; my PFP friends never really talk about it. On occasion one did say he found it a waste of time, but that's just one (biased) opinion, so I don't know the proper perspective. My final point is that PFP + Poly = 4 years total as opposed to Sec 5 + JC = 3 years; just as good as a JC retainee or MI kid lol. Note that I am in JC and find it generally manageable so I do recommend it since it does seem to open up more doors + the connections made there seem more valuable.

Anyway, my sister is taking Ns this year. BTW, she is still marginally open to going to JC but it is probably self-doubt that is preventing her from considering it as a future option. Also, this is all under the assumption that she scores well enough to consider going to PFP, although I'm sure she will.

TLDR; 1. How is PFP? Good points, bad points?

2. How is Poly? Good points, bad points?

3. What should I advise my sister to do?

I'd appreciate answers to this, especially from NP &amp; SP &amp; their business schools as that's where my sister plans to go if she does go to PFP/poly.

Whereas for Poly it’s more of getting the diploma and you may choose to either work or go to uni - but you’ll have to score a consistently high GPA.\n\nNot sure where to start but you’re to ask your sister what she’s really comfortable with. Can she take the stress of Sec 5? It’s not joke. I am also an NA student before. Had 3 pathways to choose as well. Many encouraged me to go Sec 5 but I didn’t anyway. I was a single pointer.

For starters, I don't study as much as I used to in secondary school and it's either because I'm trying to suppress the anxiety I get when I get home or away from my schoolmates or I'm too tired to force myself to squeeze out another essay. This is really bothering me because I have MYEs right after the holidays and I've honestly not started revising. I also take H1 Chinese which means my A Level Oral is right after my midyears too! AAAAA

Moving onto the scholar part, the whole thing is really adding to my stress. I feel like I'm not meeting the expectations set upon me by my teachers. I don't know if this is elitist (and please call me out if it does sound so) but I feel as though I should be performing a cut above the rest... but I can name you 20 other names who are more deserving than me.

Also, I sort of regret my subject combination. I took the subjects I'm doing now because I was good in them in secondary school. Turns out, they're not really what I want to do anymore. I feel like one of my H2s is a big dead weight. I really won't be using it after A levels.

Lastly, I've always struggled with my mental health. It really stems from a whole myriad of childhood trauma and other similar issues (which I would disclose but it seems a little irrelevant). I get tired by people but I'm a big people-pleaser so I say yes to a lot of outings but they leave me completely drained. Having a lot of new friends has also flared my anxiety... every time there's anything remotely awkward that happens, I lie awake staring at the ceiling pondering over it. It's made interacting with people close to me really strained, especially with my mother. She tries her best to engage in conversations with me but I'm constantly tired or riddled with anxiety. So when our conversations go nowhere, I can't help but feel guilty for that too. Not to mention, my self esteem is also really low. I really don't think I measure up to the other IP students too... not just academically but as a person too. I also have a problem with high expectations. So, that's unhelpful too. I just... I knew JC was going to be stressful. But I didn't think it would consume my life to this extent.

To be honest, I thought I could handle this before because I came from a relatively ""neighbourhood"" school. Its reputation precedes it to say the least, so very much the ""big fish small pond"" conundrum. But I've come to JC realising that I'm actually... pretty dumb!

don’t read if it’ll affect you too badly.

-

like many people in this reddit thread, i think i did badly for a-levels. and judging from the rank points attained throughout jc2, i’m not expecting much.

throughout the year, my rank points have never exceeded 20. this means a 7.5-5 in GP, a 12.5 for a H2, and a U for everything else. my brain has melted and it’s impossible to get a grip on it long enough for me to use it. it makes it hard for me to read, let alone analyse anything that i’ve just written.

i need BCC/B to get into desired courses, and at best i’m projecting a BDD/D , which can’t get me...anywhere, or at least not the place i intend to go.

i understand what it means to be flexible, but i don’t think i’ll be able to handle the humiliation of failure when the time comes. i don’t want to be looked at and whispered about in hushed voices, “you see her? had to retake. don’t be like her, arh.” i don’t want to only be labeled the disappointment that nobody dares to look at.

i’m tired, i’m tired, i’m tired.

looking back on my life, i don’t remember much other than a flurry of exams and the “skrit-skrit” of pens against the paper. maybe it’s because that’s all my life was, and eventually i forged my whole identity and self-esteem around grades.

this is the price i am paying now.

43,SGExams,23451,[O Levels] I reached my breaking point. Vent.,drwq3l,GloomyMain,1572945139,33,197,"I don’t even know how to start this post.  If you’re sensitive to vents that contain depressing stuff please don’t read this. 



I feel like crap and I just want to die. I hope I don’t sound whiny and annoying or whatever shit, I just want to vent here because honestly I don’t have anyone or anywhere to go and spill out my pain and, yeah. I just did Literature today— and even that I managed to freaking screw up. Everyone walked out the room smiling, “Oh prose was so easy!” Etc etc and I felt like crying but I didn’t. How could I cry in front of them? In front of those people? In front of my friends who seem fine? I think this paper was truly my breaking point. Not to mention I attempted poetry which was the biggest mistake of my life because it was harder than prose but I didn’t have time. After the mess of my combined humanities, I thought pure lit would help me but I was so wrong. I even managed to mess up the JLC qn 4b) which was honestly relatively easy. But after undergoing so many exams when my anxiety and pressure finally getting the best of me, any form of confidence shattered. I blanked out. I couldn’t think as straight, as efficiently as I normally would. Even English paper. English paper I screwed up. Paper 1 specifically. My content was so out of place and I just want to die because the topics weren’t even that hard (for personal recount and descriptive; the expository though was difficult so I didn’t do that)  but I panicked and wrote utter crap. Even paper 2 can’t save me, I don’t even know what sort of shit I wrote for summary. Even combined science (bio/chem)  I messed up. How? I mean I don’t mean any offence but combined sci does have lesser content than pure and I still manage to be unable to remember stuff. Not like I ever did pure sci in the first place anyway. I hate myself so much I can’t believe I decide to only mess up during O Levels. 


Literature paper as stated was my breaking point. I blanked out, and by the time I reached poetry each of my paras weren’t succinct and I wrote 4-8lines at least per para which for me is shit because normally I can write more, I can analyse more. Lit is something I can pass but now no. I can’t. Because I messed up. I studied, I memorized quotes, and I still messed up both sections.  And seeing other people all smiles and stuff makes me feel worse because I just feel dumb. Of course I don’t mean to criticise others because of their success— it’s good for them. I just hate myself because after all this time, 4 years studying for this exam— AND I MESS UP. I don’t even want to study or go for paper 2. Or go for sci mcq. I keep telling myself “you can do it. Maybe the other paper can pull you up.” But I came to conclusion that that’s probably impossible and BS in my case because I don’t think I can get back on track to obtain a b4 or even a c6 at this point. (For both lit and sci)



I don’t think there’s anything wrong with people who retake o Levels due to failure, neither do I discriminate or think badly of ITE. But there’s no course I even want in ITE, and I’m usually a student who scores decently- and I fear the things people would say if they found out I’m retaking O’s. Because my weak self esteem and confidence would just let this ^^ entire cycle happen again. And my parents- their disappointment and anger, I don’t even want to start on that. I hate all these expectations. The pressure. The struggle.




Some of you may think “you never know until the results are out.” But I don’t really *fully* believe that. Because I KNOW I messed up. I KNOW I’m going to fail because I let all this shit affect me. The sad thing is that even if I ‘pass’ (all C6) my L1R4 is still 36. There is no place I want to go with that. I just want to die. I don’t have anything that I’m striving for or studying for. I don’t have any goals in life that I want to achieve— and I’m at that point where I’m honestly starting to question what’s the point? What am I doing all this for? For other’s acknowledgement? For myself? To survive? What am I doing?




If you’ve read up to here thank you. Again, I hope I don’t sound rude or whiny and whatnot. I’m just tired, of everything. I don’t see a point in continuing. I feel sick, and I’m crying because I don’t even know what to do now.

0,MentalHealthSG,522,effects of childhood/ teenage bullying (physical/verbal),j23793,icemilokopicino,1601398519,2,1,"hi everyone. i’ve been contemplating on whether to share my experience of being bullied on this page, for fear that my opinions get invalidated and ridiculed, but  i figured that even if i could reach out to at least 1 of yall out there, it would mean the world to me.

growin up as a mollycoddled chubby kid in primary school, my fond size and lack of social skills caused me to be the victim of constant verbal insults. i remember the ones that hit home the hardest were usually focused on how awkward i looked when i tucked in my uniform(since my tummy would bulge). i was not spared from being physically bullied too, the worst one was having my back being pinned to the net-like gates surrounding my school hockey court by a group of 3-4 seniors and being extorted for $12.( cus they thought i kicked the football out of the court and onto the road lmao wasnt me guys). a recurring theme here was that most of the bullying incidents in pri sch were done by kids from the football team ( i.e cool kids la sia) 

moving on into secondary sch, i remember reminding myself on the first day of sch, that whatever happens, i was not gna get bullied in this sch. i grew borderline desensitised  to verbal insults by then but i just wished to be respected and treated as equal as everyone else. in a comical twist of luck i found myself somehow making the football team, hence i found myself being put into the sports class. as a kid with little to no self esteem this was synonymous to putting a goldfish into a shark tank, hence it was no surprise that i frequently became the butt of jokes and was constantly picked on. following the advice of a senior ( dumb me), i started fighting back ( physically and verbally) and this caused me some trouble in sch.  being an average player in an above average football team, it really didnt help my self-confidence hving a coach who ridiculed my lack of ability in front of everyone, inadvertently providing some of the footballers ( even juniors) more ammunition against me. i became so self-conscious about my self-image that i developed a really bad anger problem. ( breaking furniture at home, fighting) 

the result of this mental torture was that i lost complete trust in people, particularly those who met the characteristics of my previous oppressors ( basically popz kids). i became socially reclusive in my 3 years in poly ( i had a grand total of 4 friends) which as a result exacerbated my anxiety in social situations.

today as a 20 year old i cannot say for sure if i hv gotten over the trauma of being bullied. i still feel the same anxiety when i meet people who share the same characteristics as my oppressors. i find it challenging to warm up to strangers at times as i tend to question their intentions. and when i do make friends, it wd take me a hella long time to forge a deep connection as i dont wanna wear my heart on my sleeve, for fear of being manipulated. 

nevertheless having committed myself to the journey of spiritual, physical, mental growth,i have full faith in my ability to overcome my demons. i hv made significant improvements to my self worth, particularly from a physical and mental standpoint. i genuinely hope that with me writing this out, it would inspire at least one of yall out there to silence your demons and realise your worth. understand that you are a work in progress. work on yourself, little by little. self-love is the key to genuine happiness.

i also hope that i managed to relate with anyone who feels the same way as i do. you’re not alone and i’m with you.

Can we just talk about how ironic it is that some Singaporeans today talk about how racism should still not continue and post BLM despite not meeting or better yet treating a person of colour right? Its a bit sickening to see the people who were racist to me or to my malay/foreign friends. I find it ironic on how people think its not racist to make fun of each others skin colour or act like they should only get along with their race and not be able to talk with people of other races

For my own personal story on racism, I am a 16 y/o Indian Muslim boy living in Pasir ris and really, esp in pri sch, the problem is widespread. Speaking of pri sch racism there i feel is not even the child's fault, of lot of parents love to threaten their kids with things like ""oi if you dont listen to me the chinese/malay/indian man will come kidnap you"" which is really a shame because these kids grow up thinking that these races are evil and begin to discriminate against them. I fondly remember a time in pri sch where a Malay boy came to me and told me i couldnt be a muslim because ""i was indian"" and it really affected me since even at a young age i loved my religion and was now told Im not part of it because of my race. And it was because of this that i did not even want to study my mother tongue which still affects me to this day

But even in sec sch the problem was still there, i rmb my senior telling me ""Your not like other indians your not annoying"" which shocked me because thats how they viewed other indians and that somehow i was the exception. There was another time my friend called ""all malays stupid and annoying"" and when my friend told them he was malay they said the same thing to him as the other guy to me.

And this is not just among the malays and indians, even the majority of Chinese people get viewed as 'dirty' and 'unhygenic' from the same people. Which only escalates the problem further

Funny how these racist people are now just jumping on the bandwagon of BLM despite them not knowing they have affected a person's self esteem and life forever.

0,singapore,208665,Dentist recommendations for dental-phobes?,epmuit,odoroitaka,1579197239,20,1,"Hi! For the tl;dr I’m really really scared of the dentist and Im hoping for some dentist recommendations. If there is, can I hear some “success stories” on how you got the courage to visit and dentist and your experience from former dental-phobic users?

My story: 
Im extremely scared of the dentist to the extent of rather serious anxiety from just imagining going to the dentist. It has become more serious recently as I have been trying to psych myself to going to the dentist by telling myself if I put anything off any longer it will just snowball. However the fear is real as I constantly feel myself on the edge and I become to the brink of crying when I imagine dental visits although I am trying to encourage myself to do so. My initial aim was to visit a dentist in the upcoming school break but I am trying to push it forward, thus this post.

I fear almost everything in the clinic; the smell, the taste, the sound and touch. I am afraid of pain and drills/picks in general.... Common solutions seem to be listening to music and having signals with the dentist to communicate. I also fear shaming as I have low self esteem and I know I had problems. I will admit that there were periods in time that I neglected oral hygiene(and general self care) as I might have been mildly depressed but have now forced myself to stick to some routine but the damage is already done.

I have viewed existing dentist recommendation posts but most of them are a year old and Im hoping for some updated recs, or specific ones to dental phobics. Pricing is a concern (uni student) but I think I can save up for a reasonable price. How are public clinics (polyclinics?). Notable clinics that stood out from my browsing were Smile Angel@CQ and Rocher Dental. Q&amp;M seems to have mixed reviews.

4,singapore,251354,Maslow's Five Hierarchy of Needs in Singapore's context,hri5o8,Dunkjoe,1594792646,34,13,"**Maslow's Five Hierarchy of Needs (Singapore Version) \[By Dunkjoe\]**

&amp;#x200B;

The five needs are as follows, from the higher needs to the most basic needs in this order:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Self-actualisation (Self-fulfilment \[the fulfilment of one's hopes and ambitions\])

\- Esteem (Self-worth)

\- Love and belonging (Social)

\- Safety needs (Sense of security)

\- Physiological needs (Survival)

&amp;#x200B;

So, in short, I'll call it the 5 S of society.

&amp;#x200B;

In the order from the basic needs to higher needs in Singapore's context:

&amp;#x200B;

'1) Survival - I'm sure most people are familiar with the terms Kiasu and Kiasi, which are quite famous among the older generation, meaning ""Scared to lose"" and ""Scared to die"". Both actually imply similar things, which is the fear of not having enough resources to live. Or more specifically, money. It actually is quite symbolic of how Singapore was after it gained independence. There was great fear about not having enough resources to feed the family and survive in Singapore.

&amp;#x200B;

However, as Singapore grew affluent, this feeling is gone from a lot of people. Even then, there are still groups of people really affected by this, like the ""live from hand to mouth"" type and those living under the poverty line. They need to be helped in order to live properly and be able to contribute to Singapore.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Sense of security - This is tied to the feeling that one is in control, and that things will stay as status quo or better over the foreseeable future. For society, one word can encapsulate this sense of security for most people: Jobs. Without salary or some other income, it is really difficult to feel secure in Singapore.

&amp;#x200B;

And with modern society, a new issue is born: the question of sufficient resources, be it housing, money, safe environment and so on. The double whammy of the current pandemic and global recession rocks the very fabrics of society over this. There is a need for the society and individuals to find ways to stabilise their sense of security, for if not, mental health issues might become prevalent.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Social - There is this growing sentiment that young people feel lonely even as social media becomes more prevalent. I mean last time, people communicate with other people not so far away using letters! But now, a simple Whatsapp can even transmit videos! This feeling comes as people become more engrossed with their smartphones and apps, especially in Singapore.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a need to establish more avenues for people to meet similar-minded people within proximity, best is face-to-face, but during this pandemic, through digital means.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Self-worth - As the Singapore society becomes more competitive and job security is becoming a sizable concern, many people's self-worth might be affected. This is especially for people who lose their jobs in their middle ages (mid-life crisis), but can include the young generation who might take internet comments more seriously than they are warranted, given internet anonymity and internet trolls.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a need to set up popular self-help channels and ways to boost self-worth without much time, effort or money. More research needs to be in this area as to reduce the number of people possibly having depression or some other mental health issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I was quite shocked to find out recently there's this psychological trend called ""imposter syndrome"", and from what I have read here and there, it seems that there are a lot of people affected by this, often the people who are accomplished. People under this syndrome believe that they are undeserving of their achievements, aren’t as competent or intelligent as others might think—and that soon enough, people will discover the truth about them. There should be studies in Singapore and maybe public programmes to rectify this given Singapore's fast-paced and stressful environment.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.psychologytoday.com/sg/basics/imposter-syndrome](https://www.psychologytoday.com/sg/basics/imposter-syndrome)

&amp;#x200B;

5) Self-fulfilment - This is actually crucial for a developed country because most people should have sufficient levels of the previous 4 needs to have self-fulfilment needs. And it's this need that will lead a country to continue progressing and truly prosper. This is especially prevalent in successful entrepreneurs, various successful research topics by universities and other research agencies like A\*Star, among other feats that Singapore has achieved.

&amp;#x200B;

It is crucial for Singapore to boost the quality of this level, especially during these troubled times, so that people work on their maximising their potential, and to fulfil their hopes and dreams. This will propel Singapore to new heights once this crisis is over.

Its going to be quite a long post but I really hope whoever reads this can provide some help / advice. Apologies if the structure is really messy, I really find it hard to think straight right now…

So a week ago, everything was OK. I was finally getting to improve my low self-esteem and felt happy. Then, something happened to completely derail whatever efforts I had undertaken to improve my anxiety. I started to feel guilty about things that happened in the past. Things that I had no reservations about, no regrets. I never thought of these things before this week. But they suddenly all just floated to the surface for some weird reason…Its like a stone had dislodged at the base of a mountain and an avalanche came toppling down. At first it was one thing, then my mind kept overthinking and overthinking until I felt guilty about so many things piling up. The first thing I felt guilty about was for sometimes bringing camera phone into red zone during NS. Those who serve NS before would know, this is an open secret. At the start of this whole saga one week ago, the guilt of that incident, and other incidents (which I will share later), was piling on me and suffocating me. In a desperate attempt to relive the pain, I sort of confessed to my superior, whom I have not spoken to in almost 2 years, of my crime. Yes, you heard that right. I sold myself out in NS. Ridiculous right? Like you go to rob a bank and bring the money to the police station. I am still waiting to hear from her to see if any action is going to be taken against me, but that is sort of a side show. The main event comes next.

I’m currently studying in NTU, and the next major “things” I suddenly felt guilty about is the fact that there were some online tests where although we were supposed to do it on their own, I sort of did them with friends / referred to lecture notes. Like I mentioned above, at that time, I knew everyone was doing it from asking around, and I had no qualms about it either. Then now, all of a sudden, semesters after it happened, I felt guilty for not only these actions, but also for other small actions that my stupid brain deems as cheating. For example, I feel guilty that out of the corner of my eye I glanced onto my friend’s answer sheet. Just like that I also feel guilty. You know what’s the funny thing ? There was this midterm quiz where I had a China exchange student friend opposite me in the library doing his own work. He didn’t even take the module I was taking. I asked him a few questions like could I do this and that, my stupid brain injected the guilt hormones and I started feeling similar to what I feel right now, on a much smaller scale. Then I sold myself out again. I emailed the prof to tell him what I did and he must have been like dafuq ? So I think he just brushed it off. THAT is how bad my guilt gets. And another funny thing ? After I got the result from that test, it was a C+ btw, I resolved to use every method I could, right or wrong, cos I asked around and so many people did it with their friends… I was at a disadvantage. And now, I feel guilty for all that again…

This “guilty” feeling has caused me great emotional pain for the past 1 week. I could not sleep well, could not eat well and became withdrawn from my family. I knew I needed help. Hence I sought out the NTU Counsellor for an appointment. I knew I was going down the path of self-destruction. So I met the NTU Counsellor and told him my problems. I was hoping to break down and cry cos I heard crying makes you feel better, but unfortunately the tears wouldn’t come. Either way, since it was our first session, he taught me about forgiveness and mindfulness and sent me on my merry way. It’s the first session so I don’t really expect much but I gave him an analogy. I was stuck in a maze. The way out I could see was a straight line to the exit, but the exit was covered with thorns. This straight-line exit involved confessing to the professors what I did. I told him that what he was trying to do was to lead me on an alternative path for which I saw no exit, but he could possibly see the exit as he was looking at the maze from a sky view. 

I’m writing this post as a cry for help. I really don’t know what to do. I just want to be rid of this pain. The immediate, tried and tested method of solving this problem is just to fess up. But I know that will not solve the root problem. Plus there would definitely be consequences. And after each confession, my mind will start to overthink and end up I feel guilty over the same thing but with additional details. Its like when you’re trying to empty a cup of water. You thought you already poured all the water out but then at the end you find that there is still water. It never ends. For example, I bring up the NS matter again. I actually first confessed to doing something else, I’d like to keep that one private. Then messaged her a day later confessing to the red zone camera thing, then one day later confess to printing anime girls on the printer (which wasn’t even illegal). You see ? My brain will always think of something to be guilty about, no matter how small it is. Everyday is like an emotional rollercoaster. Sometimes its mild and the guilt is just…there, sometimes I cannot even muster the energy to sit at my PC to watch shows, and end up just lying on the bed most of the time. Sometimes, suicidal thoughts come into my mind and I start to think that I do not belong in this world, my honesty being a curse. So far I’ve just been brushing them off…

To anyone who has made it this far, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Just knowing that you read it until here makes it a little better. I would really appreciate some help into deciphering this matter. I question myself every day : Why people who do the wrong thing can just live with it like that? Why do I have to go through this pain and guilt? Why do I suddenly feel guilty about it so long after it has happened? Is fessing up the only way out ? 

I really hope someone, anyone can give me some advice on how to deal with this predicament because honestly, I feel like I’m fighting a losing battle where I am retreating on all fronts, desperately trying to find a way out of this situation. If you can't reply, please at least upvote the post. I AM NOT TRYING TO FISH FOR UPVOTES. I just hope that by upvoting, it gets more attention so I can possibly get more help. If you do reply, please know that I read the reply, and will do my best to reply to anything you might have said, either via PM or comment. Once again, thank you.

Bringing this up as I'm starting to notice it prevalent among some of my ex schoolmates and colleagues who are in their late 20s to early 30s. They are generally unmarried, very self victimising and mostly difficult to get along with other guys and women. A couple of them are suprisingly decent looking but with terrible self esteem. One or two bad relationships and they'll criticize and generalize singaporean women like nobody's business.


A lot of us tend to have misconceptions of the term ""manchild"" and we tend to relate it to men having ""otaku liked"" hobbies, not having a proper job or being over reliance on parents (a different topic on a whole).

9,singapore,271849,The Noisy Family.,j6td32,xDisarmed3K,1602085979,7,1,"Maybe this isn't the right subreddit to post this. If it isn't, let me know ASAP and I'll remove it.

Everyone here has experienced that noisy neighbour right? (If you don't, where do you live in, Semakau?) Chances are, if you don't, you're most likely the luckiest person in this country. Or you're the noisy one, simple as that.

Unfortunately, I belong to the latter. It's probably in our genetics at this damn point. I remember one of our neighbours called the cops when I was little because I couldn't stop crying. To be fair, that was well deserved because I was a little shit at the time. A few years after that, my mother gave birth to a son, so probably her other son wouldn't be lonely anymore. Not even 2 years later and another son has joined the game. As far as I remember, us 3 were kinda the shit you expected from kids. Quite mischievous, quite noisy, quite tolerable after a while because, kids. It really was just the 5 of us for a while. 


Then in 2013, Player 6 joined the lobby. The thing is, Player 6... was a girl. No sexist remarks, I promise. Really. Not a significant problem at the time, but after a while, could you really see why huge families are not popular in this day and age. As Player 6 grew older, she slowly developed an attitude that I could tell was a genuine growing concern. Seriously, before you go to the damn comments, please just hear me out. I hate all of my siblings equally, even myself, I'm not saying having a sister is bad. But I can already see that she will have the worst outcome in our family in the future because her attitude will be the sole factor in her failure to reach success.



When she was 5 approaching 6, her YouTube recommendations were gradually transitioning from those typical baby song channels like Cocomelon into Ryan Toys Review like channels. How it ever ended up like that remains a mystery. If you don't know who Ryan Toys Review is, I'll spare you the suffering of watching. A family who has a son named Ryan who does toys reviews and random challenges. And god are they rich. My sister watches such channels and now she has viewed, envied, and wanted a life that is impossible for our family standards. A real life princess, minus the riches. She has taken on a worse attitude because she doesn't get what she wants. Consequences include screaming, manipulation to mother, screaming, crying, tantrums, and screaming. Because she is a girl, her screams are naturally of a higher pitch, and I estimate she screams roughly twice a day. The moment I saw these videos as a problem, I confronted my mother multiple, multiple times about how the YouTube videos are changing her for the worse and ""it needs to stop."" Her response? ""aiya she's your little sister la just let her be""


Before I forget, I want to mention my father. He is genuinely the most bipolar person I've ever met, and I say this because he is an absolute angel at times, but because of current situations, is more hostile towards us than a NS encik at his breaking point. He's the root of an estimated 70% of our noise production, so that is fun.


Back on track, things have recently gotten worse when my youngest brother introduced her to his favourite game, Roblox, which was the most absolute dumbest shit he has ever done, and I swear her temper is more fragile than my self esteem. For those who don't play games, in Roblox there is some mini game called Tower of Hell or some shit and it involves parkouring around, thus it maximises your finger movements. My brother is seemingly good at this minigame (which is the only thing he plays, I'll get into that later) but cant say the same thing about my sister. She constantly fails and she gets upset easily, further aggravating her screams and tantrums. Yet she is addicted because she keeps watching my brother play on this big computer which belongs to my mother and thus gets encouraged too. I even warned her not to play if she gets angry; and she replies the same damn shit. ""I won't"" Well then, mind explaining the noise you made 5 minutes later?




And speaking of my little brother, god damn is he a little shit as well. Besides hanging out with bad influence in school, (as reported with slight exaggeration by my other brother who attends the same primary school) he does not know the value of money. Singlehandedly spent his damn money on in app purchases using his mobile phone number in the triple digits the moment he figured out how to, despite us being in such a poor state. Previously, I would say we were a low middle class family, but even with FAS, its pure luck we still have extra money to afford a charger from Challenger.


What both my brothers have in common (and me to a certain extent) are our complete neglect of studies. They game hard, study hard, eat hard. Did I say study? I mean study the game's mechanics, what were you thinking? Although I also declare guilty to that, I'm trying to put in effort to really study hard (O level gang) which puts me to my main point now.



Unlike some of you who might have the privilege of not having a noisy family, or are equipped with the powerful techniques of closing the door and windows to drown them out, I have none of that. My room is not soundproof. Everyday, it just gets worse. I am a failing student who got a 36 for his L1R4. I cannot go to school in fear of my insecurity caused by my classmates. I cant even stay at home and do revision in peace. If I cannot get into my desired course in Polytechnic because of such a hellish environment, who knows. It may not be the end, but it sure will feel like it.



In the meantime, here I sit at the wooden slab, with books and crumpled papers piled to the ceiling, emotionlessly pressing a combination of letters to string together the experience of being part of the noisy family. All while I hear sentences about ""Studying hard is good and playing Roblox too frequently is bad. ""I don't have enough slime for my dolls and I'm upset"" ""My friends aren't bad, why won't you let me hang out in the mall with them?"" ""Stop screaming!"" all while screaming at the same time, overlapping, intersecting, fusing, combining, into an indescribable lump.

10,singapore,287064,Was it worth it to try and seek closure at the expense of my career and earning potential?,jxty5x,lizette2368,1605895066,15,1,"In my first job, I joined a marketing agency as an intern with the potential to convert to a perm employee. I didn't do well and didn't get converted. I was fresh out of uni then. That experience damaged my self confidence and self esteem.

I joined another company, this time client side. I didn't move up for 4 years, but did manage to switch departments into a job function that I wanted to get into for a long time. 

But something was nagging at me. I knew that I had to seek some form of closure from my experience in my first job, and I knew that time was running out because I was past the age where I could be considered as joining an agency.

So I did it. And hence my ""redemption arc"" began, where I joined a digital marketing agency as an entry level person, which I'm now in for over a year. I had try to redeem myself and to move past the experience that was my first job.

But I felt it was done at the cost of my own career. Seeing my peers move up the career ladder and doing well, and earning so much more, made me wonder if it was the right thing to do in seeking closure from my past failure at the expense of career advancement and salary earnings. My first job is still something that I feel deeply ashamed about, and I don't bring it up during job interviews.

Right now, I'm trying to find a job that pays better (preferably in eCommerce), that could at least bring me up to market rate, but it's hard, (presumably because I'm stuck in an entry level job for so long trying to regain my confidence and self esteem), and I'm being measured against other people with similar years of experience, and I'm not sure if HR might doubt my skills or capabilities because of it. 

They say that you are the control your own career, but I call bs on that. There's a huge element of luck involved. I've had a colleague (fresh grad), who secured a job within a single 40minute interview with a higher title and increase in salary (putting her ahead of me in terms of everything), while I had to go through rounds of interviews and assignments and rejections. I've been at it for so long, it's giving me so much stress and causing me sleep problems. 

Right now, I just want a chance to put myself back at market rate and to put my career back on track, in a field I like. I want to close off my redemption arc, but I'm having trouble finding a job, which means I'm still in my current story arc.

I wrote a long story, but I just wish that I can have that one chance to get into that field that I like and at a decent rate, which gives me options to progress my career in a direction I want to. 

Was it worth it to try and seek closure at the expense of my career and earning potential? I guess if I made another decision, I would have probably earned more and have a better title and job, but that failure would still have been at the back of my mind from time to time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jxty5x/was_it_worth_it_to_try_and_seek_closure_at_the/,1.0,"['Bro, this isn’t an anime story.

14,singapore,166805,Musings of an LGBT individual,bkvcgq,snowpyne,1557043699,98,267,"I decided to write this post after there was a resurgence of the LGBT topics here in the sub. I’ve been reading them frequently and am honestly amazed at the knowledge people have. I’ll admit that I’m not really familiar with most of the technical and logical theories that people have brought up.

&amp;#x200B;

This led me to question the best way to reach out and appeal to the anti-LGBT groups: by logical arguments and technical knowledge or by appealing to emotions? I don’t have the answer but I figured sharing one's experience as an LGBT individual could help people to understand better what individuals in our community go through. Of course, this is not necessarily applicable to every LGBT individual as everyone comes from different socioeconomic backgrounds. This is my own experience and perceptions.

&amp;#x200B;

The one thing that I wish people understood is how our sexuality is involved and brought into question into almost every aspect of our lives. And this begins the moment we start discovering ourselves.

&amp;#x200B;

During school

&gt;Why am I different from the other boys in school?  
Is there something wrong with me?  
How come the religion that I was brought up with says that I’m a bad person? I haven’t done anything evil or malicious towards anyone?  
How will my parents react? Will they be angry or disappointed? I will never be the son that they wanted and I won’t be able to have a family. Should I tell them? What if they pass away before knowing the real me? Will other people, such as my friends, treat me differently if they knew about it?

Couple this with the usual teenage angst, body and self-esteem issues, and it’s the perfect recipe for mental health issues. I started self-harming.

&amp;#x200B;

National Service

&gt;Should I declare?  
What if I don’t and I get bullied by the other guys?

In the end, I did not declare. But figured I should just share with the MO what I was experiencing: that I liked guys more than girls. I was still figuring myself out. But the MO dictated that I should come down for another visit with my parents. I couldn’t leave them in the dark so I had to come out to them even though I wasn’t ready. They dismissed it as a phase. I was assigned to PES C. Initially I thought it was because of my asthma, but apparently it was because the MO deemed me effeminate. It was then that I realized that people like me will never be accepted in these spheres, where they still see LGBT issues as a medical condition. I wasn’t even granted security clearance.

&amp;#x200B;

University

It was here where I finally embraced my identity. The things I learnt made me realize that there was nothing wrong with me. That the world is never black and white and that individuals experience life differently. Even things like religion, where everyone has different interpretations and that there’s no one person who can dictate that their interpretation is the right one. Of course, I understand that some may argue that this is self-serving, that I was justifying myself. But still, I finally felt that life was coming together for me, and that there’s a future. I also finally sought treatment for my mental health, where I was diagnosed with dysthymia.

&amp;#x200B;

But then, issues started to arise again. I had to think about what exactly is my future.

&gt;I am not able to buy a house until I am 35  
If I want to start a family, it won’t be possible here. Same-sex marriage is not recognised. Having children through adoption/surrogacy is difficult. In the event that one of us is suffering from health issues, we cannot make decisions on behalf of each other.  
This means that I would have to move. This could be a stressful process, both emotionally and financially.  
But then my family and friends are also here. Why am I being forced to choose between them and my own life?  
Will my sexuality be an issue when I apply for jobs, especially for government ones? I recently applied for a job and got into the selection rounds. But when they asked about my PES status, I decided to be truthful. I was eventually unsuccessful in going to the next round. I will never know if it was my lack of ability or due to my sexuality.

It almost seems like normal, heterosexual people have a general outline and framework that they can work with to guide their lives. Graduate, find a job, get married and have kids. But for LGBT individuals, every decision and milestone of our lives has to be carefully considered about how it will affect the future that we want.

LGBT individuals also have dreams and aspirations. We don’t want special privileges or rights. All we want are inclusive policies and rights so that we can actually lead our lives normally, just like other people.

You can compare how they treated former 2NE1 member,Park Bom.They called her a drug trafficker despites she herself having a medical condition.she has a condition that called Lymph Nodes. Yes the medicine that she flew in was not legal in SK,but legal in America.

To me,SK should have made leeway here unless ok the medication can make her hallucination or that can cause health problem,but clearly it didn't cause any problem to her.

Maybe her condition is rare is Korea,but when the media put such headlines,no wonder their people are having depression,low self esteem &amp; etc.

I think people need to be more aware of depression,not just SG but around the world.

I feel helpless sometimes that i can't express myself whenever i am angry thus whenever i watch videos,i tend not to laugh or even curse openly.

I feel like 'why do i even live that i can't even express myself openly'.

I really don't know if i am a nice guy with just a big mouth or am i truly a bad guy who throw racist remark when i am angry.

20,singapore,131114,Would you consider this be an accurate representation of GEP life?,98ki5s,pratakosong,1534688027,1,1,"Source : [https://www.facebook.com/nicklebee.tutors/posts/2220488207978531](https://www.facebook.com/nicklebee.tutors/posts/2220488207978531)

[What To Expect as a GEP Student : Life &amp; Challenges of a Gifted Education Programme (GEP) Student in Singapore]

Hi, this is Mr Zhou, founder and Math Educator of NickleBee Tutors.

Recently, some parents of my Primary 3 students came to me to ask for my opinion of what to expect if their child gets into the Gifted Education Programme. They were concerned with whether their children can cope with the perceived academic rigour of the GEP and if they will be stressed by the increased workload encountered in the programme.

I was formerly a student of the Gifted Education Programme (Rosyth ‘94 to ‘96; Raffles Institution ’97 to ’00), and I have had the opportunity to teach close to a hundred GEP students over the last decade.

Given that the GEP screening test is in less than a week’s time, I felt that perhaps it would be best to share my experience and give parents a better perspective on what a GEP kid will face as a typical “GEP-per” (pronounced “Jeeper”).

(1) Better Teacher To Student Ratio

In the GEP, your child will be in class sizes of between 24 to 26 students. I am crystal clear about this because my name starts with ‘Z’ and I was always the last in the class register. The much smaller teacher to student ratio definitely helps with the attention that your child will receive from the teachers.

(2) Academic Work Is Much More Intensive

GEP teachers typically teach at a faster pace to prevent the students from getting bored and becoming disruptive or lose focus. Also, the syllabus and homework load will be quite a bit more than what your child will be accustomed to.

Project work (known as Individualized Study Options now) will also take up large portions of your time, with there being IRS (Individualized Research Study) and IvP (Innovation Programme) amongst other assorted Challenges, Olympiads, Presentations and Competitions that your child have to take part in.

Students are also required to take an additional 5th subject (Social Studies) which will also be tested as part of the PSLE exam (GEP students are required to pass it but it will not be included in the T-score).

Hence if the students are not on task and become distracted, they will not be able to keep up with the rigorous academic pacing and may start to fall behind.

(3) The GEP Curriculum Is Comparatively Broader And Deeper.

For example, just in the first half of Primary 4 GEP, students will be taught the ancient number systems (i.e Sumerian, Aztec, Egyptian counting systems) or doing calculations in different bases during Math lessons. Also, they will be introduced to the different literary genres (i.e Horror, Fantasy, Sci-Fi) and Greek / Roman mythology during their English classes.

These are not just passing remarks by the teachers or simple enrichment activities. In fact, such topics are deeply integrated with the syllabus and there are worksheets to be done and group projects to be completed on such areas.

You may find your child being more engaged as compared to the lower primary years and will therefore be stretched to achieve his maximum potential.

On a personal level, I was always more inclined towards the Math and Sciences rather than Languages. In lower primary, I read mostly encyclopaedias, historical biographies and mensa books, with fiction books being dismissed as fairy tales. It was thus a surprise to me, when my eyes were opened to a whole new literary universe thanks to my Primary GEP English teacher (Mr Grosse), who introduced me to the wonders of the Science-Fiction universe and I have been an avid reader of books (still mostly Sci-Fi or Fantasy) since. My world view would have been much poorer if I had just stuck to reading non-fiction books.

(4) Self-Esteem And Self-Confidence May Take A Plunge

A number of my GEP students did feedback to me that they get disheartened when their results go on a downwards spiral once they enter the GEP. They realise they cannot just coast along on just their intellect like in lower primary.

I simply share with them my own experience as a GEP student who excelled in Math &amp; Science but was terrible with Languages.

I used to score close to 100% for all subjects in Primary 1 to Primary 3 and so, once I started failing the English GEP Common Tests in Primary 4, it was a definite blow to my self-esteem and a shock to my parents. What I did was to buck up, start reading more, and listen to the BBC world service broadcasts to widen my vocabulary and memorize key phrases to use in my English writings. After a while, my English results did improve and so did my self-esteem and self-confidence.

(5) The Importance Of Filing

Your child will learn that systematic and neat filing of all worksheets and academic work is required for all subjects. In fact, filing is graded, and marks are given for effort and tidiness.

I was horrible at filing and felt it was a huge waste of time and a giant bore. But over the years, I understood that filing was meant to help GEP students learn to compartmentalize large amounts of data / knowledge and give us a systematic reference point from which we can process and retrieve information efficiently.

Up to today, I am grateful for this approach to storing and retrieving of information. Otherwise I would be over whelmed with all the stuff and knowledge learnt over the years.

I tell this to my GEP students, but being young, I am not sure if they understand my point of view.

(6) Passing Mark Of 70% Overall For All Subjects.

I often get asked of this by parents of all GEP kids. Apparently, they have been told that the passing grade as mandated by the Gifted Education branch is 70% overall for all subjects, and the penalty for not achieving that lofty goal is being asked to leave the programme.

I just point out that in all my years of being in the GEP and having had the opportunity to teach many dozens of GEP kids over the last decade, I have never heard of anyone being asked to leave the GEP due to not meeting the 70% threshold for their overall grades. Of course it is an ideal all GEP students should strive for but it is not something that should make you lose sleep over.

(7) Being Gifted Does Not Automatically Make Your Child Academically Inclined

A number of parents have this misconception that being selected for the Gifted Education Programme means that their children will not need to worry about academic grades and will definitely do tremendously well for the PSLE and all other academic exams they face.

This couldn’t be further from the truth. Being gifted does has some correlation with academic grades but it is not a sure win bet on future academic success! Your child will still need to pay attention in class, request help from teachers if they don’t understand a concept well, do their homework diligently and conduct productive revision sessions before their exams. All these are study and exam skills that all students have to develop whether they are from the GEP or not.

(8) GEP And How It Relates To The PSLE.

ALL GEP students still have to take the same PSLE papers together with the mainstream students. And unlike a few years back, being in the GEP no longer gives you special priority in the Direct School Admission (DSA) exercises.

So, the main take away is that the PSLE will still be the primary focus for every GEP student.

The mainstream students would have entirety of the upper primary years to prepare unceasingly for the PSLE. On the other hand, the GEP students would have spent a large chunk of those years learning and expanding their horizons in areas, which while undoubtably very important in the larger scheme of things, are not examinable in the PSLE.

There have been numerous cases of GEP students who did not get the PSLE T-score that they hoped to achieve. Some even fail to make it into the express stream. I hope this will encourage all GEP students to be less complacent about the PSLE and focus on doing well for it even if they have a DSA Confirmed Offer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/98ki5s/would_you_consider_this_be_an_accurate/,0.0,"['Facebook links are not allowed on this subreddit.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I personally feel that Malay families are more supportive to their kids about following their dreams. Unfortunately for them, dreams in Singapore just don't pay off financially and educationally which can be a long and tedious process.

Growing up, I was in the Normal Academic stream and it does something to your self-esteem. Even though I've caught up to my peers but i always feel that I have a chip on my shoulders and i have to work harder to keep up.

I posted this on Facebook and my friend prompted me to share it here.,9i530c,buttoxide,1537668724,550,1456,"""Homosexuals are doomed to spend eternity in hell. If they wanted to change, they could be healed of their evil ways. If they would turn away from temptation, they could be normal again. If only they would try, and try harder, if it doesn't work.""

These were the words said by Mary Griffith to her son, Bobby Griffith, in the movie ""Prayers for Bobby"" - a story of a how Mary Griffith, staunch Christian Mom of Bobby Griffith, fights to cure her gay son of his homosexuality. Bobby eventually spirals into depression and self-loathing. One night, he falls off a bridge on a highway into the path of an oncoming truck, which kills him instantly.

I still remember that afternoon, almost ten years ago by now. My mom and I were in the car on Grange Road, just about to turn left into Ngee Ann City. This was during the aftermath of the AWARE saga in Singapore (AWARE is a women's organization in Singapore. in 2009, a group of right-wing Christians orchestrated a takeover protest of their sexual education material in which same-sex attraction was deemed OK). The radio was covering the story and asked for listeners to call in with their views on the matter. After listening to the cover, my mom at the steering wheel turned to me and said a sentence I will never forget.

""These homosexuals are evil, and they should burn in hell.""

I understand that in staunchly religious households, such words would not have been uncommon. However, what affected me was the speed, the surprise, and the suddenness of it all. I was minding my own business in the car, and in that single sentence, the mom that I knew for twenty years was gone. In her stead I could only see someone else - caring in same way, but it never felt like the same person that I could trust. If this person found out about my secret, what would happen to me? I dared not find out.

To my mom, it was an off-handed comment that she probably won't remember. But to me, it felt like my entire world was upended.

Have you watched the Pixar movie, Inside Out? Central to the movie was the idea of core memories, which were key moments in one's life that shape one's personality. This very moment, to me, became one of them. The suddenness of the topic and the vitriol in her voice was unforgettable. This memory has stuck to me till this very day, almost ten years down the road.

If you're gay, no one is safe, not even from their families. The world felt a lot darker, and a lot more dangerous.

I stayed silent for the rest of the journey. At the time, it was only a few more months until it was time for me to go to America to pursue my undergraduate studies. It was in that very moment, I vowed to myself that I *must* keep my secret away from family. I knew that had my parents found out, there was a real danger that they would cut off funding to me and call me back because they would assume I was 'influenced by the western agenda' - even though I already knew starting in secondary school!

For the next four years, I bided my time in college. I did call back to my parents, but I hated the idea of doing so. I figured that the less I share about my life, the less likely my parents would find out, and I could graduate in peace. The goal was to remain closeted until I was financially independent, and I succeeded. I am fortunate to come from a financially stable family. My parents have absolutely no need for me to support them for retirement. Hence, my primary concern was to establish a stable income for myself. It was only through freedom of a stable income could I not rely on the parents that could possibly kick me out for being gay. Was that paranoia? True, it was highly unlikely for my family. But it was a chance I could not afford to take.

Overall, I had a good college experience. Back in Singapore, my church, while not outwardly hateful, did weigh in on the topic of homosexuality with the usual quotes from Leviticus, along with a sprinkle of ""lifestyle"", ""choice"", and (my personal favorite) ""hate the sin, not the sinner."" At least I could now enjoy my Sundays, without the occasional self-denigration from the pulpit.

But the past sermons and that memory continued to affect me. Night after night, I called out to God and asked him why? Why couldn't I, like the Book of Mormon musical, ""turn it off""? It certainly didn't feel like a choice. If it was, why burden me with such a choice when everyone else seems to have it easy? Is this God’s cruel punishment on me for something else? I always wondered what would have happened if I was born gay in a different environment. I read of Matthew Shepherd, the American student who was beaten, tortured, and left to die. I read of news about ISIS, where brothers and parents threw their gay families off buildings. Some friends dismissed it as the work of crazy people. All I could think of was that car drive on Grange Road. I could not shake off the look in her eyes. Perhaps society is just a few laws away from craziness, after all.

Four years passed and I got my degree with distinction. I returned back to Singapore, with a stable job waiting for me - mission accomplished! But shortly after, my dad decided to have a private talk with me - one of the few he's ever had with me his entire life. He inquired why I felt so distant, so different from the boy he once knew. My mom, who was always a worrywart, has visibly aged since four years ago. Because I have become so distant and resistant to communication, she worried even more in my absence.

I was not ready to share the real reason why I was so silent. I clammed up again. I felt no motivation to share my reason anymore. I have survived four years without sharing my life. Why start now? I have learned to stop caring about sharing my life with my parents.

Shortly, my mom found out about my sexuality. I gathered it was probably due to my over-zealous sharing of Pink Dot posts on Facebook (I didn’t really care about them finding out at this point). One day, my Mom confronted me about it. When she took my silence to be a ‘yes’, while holding back tears, the first words out of her mouth were ""We shouldn't have sent you to the U.S."" In the end, my prior fears were not unfounded. In that moment, I felt validated - validated that my strategy for those four years was not unfounded and could have saved me from an early withdrawal from school.

Thankfully, for me, it was a (reasonably) happy end. After the tears, she said that while she can't approve of my 'lifestyle' due to the church, she did say that she still loves me.

Overall, I count myself as one of the lucky ones. Besides this incident, my parents have given me every material need, the necessary attention, and tools needed to succeed in life. I was never thrown out of the house, beaten as child, nor been assaulted on the street (yet). However, I cannot say the same for some of my friends and the greater gay community as a whole. I have no illusions; I've had a great life so far. But if that single moment on Grange Road still affects me ten years after, I am sure that some other son, in some other less privileged family, with less money, less love, and denied opportunities to stay hidden, would have it much worse. ""Prayers for Bobby"" was based off a true story, after all.

Hence, for those who believe that 377A is 'just a symbol', then consider yourself even more fortunate than I am. To many, 377A is not 'just a symbol'. For some, 377A has become the flag in which the religious right is using to rally its supporters. For some, 377A is a constant reminder that we feel less like citizens but more like a bargaining chip to the government. For some, 377A has become the perfect veil for others say hurtful, ignorant comments with little repercussions on sunny little Singapore.

To me, it is clear: day after day, 377A is a sum of all of the above. It is a constant reminder that we are alone against our bullies.

To the religious who believe that repealing 377A will lead to the moral decay of Singapore, the story of ""Prayers for Bobby"" does not end at Bobby's death. Marry Griffith desperately searches for answers to her son's death and eventually realizes that it was her hurtful words that drove her own son to suicide. She shares in her closing speech:

""Unknown to you, they will be listening, as you echo 'amen'. And that will soon silence their prayers. Their prayers to God for understanding, and acceptance, and for your love. But your hatred, and fear, and ignorance of the word 'gay' will silence their prayers. So, before you echo 'amen' in your home, and place of worship, think. Think, and remember. A child is listening.""

So if you've read all the way to this point, please remember that even if you are a regular churchgoer with no contact with the gay community, I am sure that someone you know and love is being hurt by your very actions. It could be one of the quiet kids sitting in the corner every Sunday School. It could be your best friend, your cousin who's never seemed to have a girlfriend. Above all, it could be your son who you never suspected a bit. And just like every mention of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 from the pulpit, I can tell you from personal experience that each mention of 377A along with the ""hate the sin, not the sinner"" rhetoric will chip away at that kids self-esteem and self-worth.

So let the movie ""Prayers for Bobby"" be a cautionary tale. The real damage to society will not come from the moral decay that you speak of. It will come from the erosion of trust between you and the children that you never knew were listening to your words all along. As Mary Griffith realized too late, you can't turn back the clock once the deed has been done.

But unlike Mary Griffith's situation, the Singapore story does not end... yet. The absence of 377A itself will also be a new symbol. A symbol that a secular Singapore with religions preaching harmony and not division as the way forward. A symbol that the government does not make short-term voter gains at the expense of minority citizens. A symbol that gay people are no longer defined by a law 'gross indecency' but are finally reduced to mere human beings, just like everyone else.

And for those who aren't LGBT and are quiet or ambivalent about showing your support, we do need your help to drown out the noise of bigotry. Just as how my experience was traumatic and drove me back to hiding, your outward show of support, whether you realize it or not, is a huge deal for those around you who are still closeted and in hiding. It will give them less and less reasons to hide. The single raindrop never feels responsible for the flood, but with your help, I pray that the tide will turn sooner.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9i530c/why_377a_matters_to_me_i_posted_this_on_facebook/,0.0,['The church and mosque should stay out of state matters and keep their mouth shut.

I have on and off flash backs of being given cpr in the ambulance by paramedics, and the next thing I knew I woke up in the hospital after being in a coma for 2 weeks. Apparently I died, and paramedics brought me back. I was still broken, spiritually and physically. 

After that, I lived my life with tons and tons of counselling. From 16 to 20, I was diagnosed to have body dysmorphia disorder and depression. I was given medications and had to go to a lot of therapy. Over the years, I got better, but I had irreversible self esteem and confidence issues since. At 22, I was saved by a guy who loved me with all his heart, even though I had so much baggage. We are still working things out despite it all. But because of what happened, I was inspired by the paramedics, not a day goes by where I don't think about how I could have been dead. And this made me become a paramedic myself. I may never be happy with myself, no matter how much therapy I get. Being bullied and teased does scar you for life. Even if so, this community does mean a lot to me because for not having experienced a real family, you guys have made me feel like I'm worth something.

Ever since I was young, I was very particular about how others see/judge me. The way I looked, behaved and talked were always the first thing that came into mind when I’m interacting with someone. This contributes to the reason why I am “socially inept” because the anxiety is overcoming my train of thought and words that came out of my mouth are not what I desire. Along with the low self-esteem and confidence, I find it difficult to make friends because I’m what everyone calls a “quiet kid”. 

Fast-forward in life, I didn’t make any efforts to seek help. My condition deteriorated so badly that I refuse to speak to anyone. I tried to avoid conversation entirely due to the fear of being judged or embarrassed. 

My wakeup call was when I realized that I can’t live my life being mute any longer! Since it’s a new year, I want to be a better person. I’ve tried visiting my school’s counselor (took a lot of courage) but I found it ineffective. 

I have not told anybody about my condition as I’m too embarrassed to share it with them and I’ve yet to declare my mental state in the pre-enlistment for NS since I’ve never gotten a professional assessment of my mental health before. I know mental issues are a taboo subject in SG and I’m sorry if I offended anyone but are there better ways can I go about seeking help? Is it possible to fight this battle on my own?

Shy Guys:

Many Singaporean guys I've met can be rather hesitant to meet new people, and tend to have low self-esteem when it comes to girls. Even when the guy's really quite charming and/or attractive. And sometimes, even when they're in a bar next to an attractive lady that keeps glancing up at them. The flip side would be ultramisogynistic guys I've met, which honestly feels like a really pathetic way to compensate for the same insecurities. A Singaporean girl once told me that she feels girls have to be more forward from uni on cuz they got tired of waiting for the guy to make a move. Guys, is this true of you, and if so, is there a reason? Girls, was and is this true of your crushes/significant other?

Shy Girls:

While the stereotype of the ideal Singaporean guy is not something well-defined for me, the stereotype of the ideal Singaporean girl seems a lot more prevalent, even enforced. Blushing and giggling at every flirtation, always more concerned about his every whim than their own needs, and basically falling apart when he's not there.

0,NationalServiceSG,6256,Anxiety? Depression? Help.,kkha11,chaorecroot,1608982595,11,1," wall of text inbound. 

Before I entered the army I guess I’ve been kinda happy… I have many hobbies (photography, sim racing, cycling, etc) with barely any issues, though I am relatively introverted. I enlisted in around August (PTP batch) and integrated pretty well (I was enjoying waking up early and actually doing PT and stuff).

Sometime later, around the first week of BMT, I started getting anxiety issues. Nausea, light headedness and stuff that stays for the duration of the day, and sometimes even a day or two. OC said something about “sinking feeling every book in”, and I assumed it was that. A few weeks later, it started getting bad. I was breaking down, having anxiety attacks almost every weekend, and I hated it even more. I started to loathe notifications and alarms (I completely turn off everything when I get home on the weekend), and any message notifications get me super anxious and depressed (even though it may be someone else’s phone). I chalked it up to burnout, which I guess happens when an introvert is forced into communal living. Around my field camp week (1st week of November), things started going real bad real fast, and I started getting more and more anxiety attacks on the weekends, and started having constant headaches and backaches (that exist to this day). 

I RSO-ed for ARI for 3 days (for a bad cough and runny nose), and spent a day in camp the entire week. I didn’t feel any better mentally, and my headache was still there. When I booked back in the following week, I had to sit out of the 24K route march because of headache and back pain. I started getting moodier, pissed off at people, and around this time I also started getting more and more pissed at myself. My bunk mates would torment me and constantly call me chao-keng for having a headache, and wouldn’t help me with tasks because they “don’t talk to chao keng”. It got bad to the point that I carried my SOG with me as a reminder of what not to do.

Then came block leave, which was honestly even more miserable. I was constantly anxious about not meeting my schedules (I had lunch with a few close friends, and went on a photography trip), but I had to work around not having an alarm clock (hate alarms). I got anxious that I would be posted to command school and have to deal with more pressure and more toxic behaviour from people. When the posting finally came out, I was slightly relieved that i didn’t manage to get to command school, but I was also really depressed because I had been posted back to my mono unit. I decided to tahan until I reported into camp to report sick, and I reported sick for my backache and headache, and lo and behold I was given 2 days LD and painkillers (that hadn’t worked for any of the pain so far). I finished the course of the painkillers and there was no change. 

I constantly questioned myself whether something was truly wrong with me; why everyone was against me 24/7 and I couldn’t do anything about it. I informed my PC and Sec Comm about my anxiety issues and they chalked it up to adjustment disorder, and told me I have no choice but to suck it up and tahan the 2 years. Fast forward 1 week, and I had 3 anxiety attacks in 1 day, and had breathing difficulties and chest pain for the day. I asked permission to RSO, and they denied, asking me to report sick in camp. I dragged myself to camp, told myself I would have one night of rest before I can finally see the MO. The next day, I reported sick, and the sec comm told me I would go in the afternoon to see the MO. Sometime through the day, OC came to talk to me and told me that I was just having adjustment issues and that I seemed fine in training day to day, and told me he wasn’t going to let me see the MO. 

I do acknowledge that I have self esteem issues and struggle to fit in at times, but surely breaking down every weekend for 2 months, losing sleep over the weekend and choosing to stay at home is more than just adjustment issues. I find it hard to relax over the weekend because I’m constantly worried about overshooting the timing. I barely have sleep because I wake up every 15 minutes and dread the alarm clock. I’ve been trying to suck it up, telling myself that other people have it worse, but it makes me feel worse that I’m feeling bad about such  “trivial” matters.

It feels to me like living day to day for other people has become the new norm, and the only time that I’m alone is when its late at night. On the weekends I have to visit my grandparents, go out to buy things for camp.

Day to day life in camp has even been more depressing. I want to rest but I have to wash clothes. Showers take twice as long because I have to mentally prepare myself for the cold water. I wake up 1.5 hours before reveille so that I can ensure I wash up before the day. I barely have time to eat at meals, and I have to battle constant headaches and  backaches. 

I honestly don’t know what to do right now, I’m at the end of the line and have run out of ideas. RSO-ing without permission could land  me with an insubordination charge, but waiting for the chain of command/MO may delay so long that I fear I may end up being suicidal in a week or two. I honestly don’t have any motivations anymore as my long term goals have been derailed. The current phase of training will last until July 2021, and it’s basically BMT on steroids, and I’m seriously already burnt out. I’m missing important family activities, and now even holidays are being planned without me. Is it even worth pushing forward for another 2 years, yielding for yet another white lie? Bookouts are a pain, and I don’t even have the time to relax or do my hobbies anymore.

I'm also severely underweight at risk of nutritional deficiency (although I generally eat a lot), and physically I do not look good at all like a skeleton (and was even compared to people from 3rd-world countries).

In my freshmen year, I was consistently stressed out and overwhelmed by the academic pressure. My anxiety and distress were perpetuated by a highly competitive school environment. My only haven on campus was my dorm room, where I could cry freely away from prying eyes. I would experience multiple mental breakdowns within a week and my only source of comfort was advice from online threads. I did share my struggles with family and friends. However, they could not empathize with me because they were in different phases of life. Having almost no friends in college made it difficult to share my struggles openly as well.

## Suffering from Imposter Syndrome (Believing I Did Not Deserve A Place in College)

Do you feel that you are not smart enough to be in college? Do you consistently compare yourself with the people around you? Do you feel like the only person who does not have their shit together? I admit that I am very guilty of all the above. Enrolling into NUS was a game-changer as I grew up attending neighborhood schools. Here, I am competing with students from better ranking schools and are from the cream of the crop. They were better prepared at managing the academic rigor of higher education. They too were more resourceful and adjusted faster to university. Despite coming from the same education system as them, I felt intimidated and under-equipped to manage this tricky situation.  

&amp;#x200B;

My self-esteem plummeted throughout my freshman year. I was consistently comparing myself to my peers. Many students were on gifted or scholarship programs, excelling in professional networking, participating in academic competitions, or holding a high committee position. Meanwhile, I had no other achievements that could supplement my portfolio. The demanding curriculum made it difficult to take on extra commitments because I needed time to study. My lack of time caused me to question my intelligence. Was it because I am not smart enough to comprehend concepts quickly? Was it because I am not good enough to in NUS? Maybe I should just accept the fact that I am a failure compared to my classmates. With each passing day, my mind would continue to spiral with these negative thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Upon enrollment, I realized I was younger than most of my peers. Many people within the cohort were older due to various reasons. To add to my anxiety, my frantic mind assumed that my young age was a disadvantage. I started to nitpick on my mistakes. After all, experience in life comes with age. If I made a wrong decision, was it because of my lack of maturity? If I said or did the wrong things, was it because I am ignorant? This mindset affected my ability to perform in school. It was difficult to voice my ideas and opinions in group projects because I believed that I lacked wisdom and judgment. I had concluded that perhaps I should not even be in college.  

&amp;#x200B;

Every day, I felt that I did not deserve my place in NUS. It seemed like there are way more qualified individuals than myself, and I was accepted because I was lucky. Even if I performed well on a task in school, I would attribute it to hard work instead of my intelligence. There was a nagging doubt that I did not earn my accomplishments using my intellect. Self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy would continue to plague me for the majority of my freshmen year. 

&amp;#x200B;

In hindsight, I was likely suffering from imposter syndrome. It is said to occur among high achievers who are unable to internalize and accept their success. This experience is common among individuals who are starting a new and challenging position. Imposter phenomenon is not a mental disorder. Instead, it is a reaction to external stimuli or events. Imposter syndrome is having the feeling of phoniness and believing that you will be found as a fraud. Instead of acknowledging my abilities, I often attributed my successes to external forces. When I am around schoolmates, I often fear that they would uncover my lack of abilities and expose my incompetence. Despite obtaining decent grades in school, I continued to doubt my capabilities. It seemed as though no threshold would put these feelings to rest. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

### How Did I Manage Imposter Syndrome?

Now, I believe that the first step to solving any problem is recognizing that there is a problem. It was in semester 2 of my freshman year when I started to recognize my unhealthy thought patterns. I had placed a large emphasis on success and achievements and was constantly under tremendous pressure to perform. After all, I wanted to make up for the perceived lack of capability between me and my peers. Constant comparison between myself and them, me nitpicking my failures and my feelings of inadequacy perpetuated the problem. How did I recognize that I was suffering from imposter syndrome? My father reminded me that the pressure I was under was created by only myself. It then dawned on me that perhaps, I was being too hard on myself. Then, I still could not name what I was feeling. The term imposter syndrome was introduced when I was in Year 2.

&amp;#x200B;

Acknowledging the limitations of my competence and capabilities improved my mental health significantly. Previously, I was caught up in chasing the goals and expectations others had set for themselves. Whenever I fell short of those expectations, I was reminded of my ineptness. Coming to terms with the fact that I am just not as intelligent, talented, or capable as others have relieved the pressure to perform on the same level. Why was I stuck in the cycle of chasing expectations that were determined by other people? Should not I be comparing my achievements to my expectations? This realization broke the chains of despair that had been holding me back for the entire academic year. My academic progress was on track with the goals I had set, and I did not fall short of my expectations. I had been so caught up in the rat race that I forgot to ask myself why I was in it.

  
Do gauge where you stand in the cohort within the first few weeks of school. From there, decide whether you want to join the crazy study grind or take things easy. Reaching this decision early can help you to deal with the overwhelming stress and competition in college better. In NUS, there are also counseling services at the university counseling center (USC). If you are feeling overwhelmed by the academic pressure, talking to a counselor or therapist may help you to cope better. Do note that there is a long wait time (about one month) for services at USC. 

&amp;#x200B;

Remember that you are not to be defined by any assignment, exam, or GPA. You are bigger than that. We want the effort we put into studying to be validated, but this validation does not have to come from grades. It hurts when we do not get what we work hard for, but it does not mean that we will not be successful in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

## Feeling Lonely in University

If asked to describe college, the word lonely is an unlikely adjective. After all, college is meant to be fun and exhilarating and the media reinforces this concept continuously. Like everyone else, I was excited to enroll in college and have the best time of my life. I was ready to drink, party, and make lifelong friends. I am young, in my prime, and ready to have fun. What could go wrong?  

&amp;#x200B;

I joined several freshmen orientation camps and met numerous people. My contact list grew longer and my followers on Instagram increased significantly. As the academic year started, I was kept busy for the first few weeks as I attended school fairs and welcome events. Eager to partake in the robust co-curricular activities my school had to offer, I joined several clubs. Yet, the enthusiasm and keenness started faded away fairly quickly before recess week.

  
Although I enjoyed myself during orientation, I never saw some of my orientation mates again. I also stopped talking to the friends I made because they already had friend groups from high school. I did not move away from home to attend college and many students in my college were the same. Yet, none of my friends were in the same college as me so I was alone.  

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, I felt that the friends I made in college did not put in the same effort as I did to maintain the friendship. I presume that it is because they already have friends from high school. Friends in college seem to just hang out to have fun and they have no interest to get to know one another better. Friendships formed from project groups feel transactional as well. It feels like the friendship purely serves to facilitate good teamwork. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is depressing and demoralizing to witness so many people having their closest friends with them. Together, they can create memories while they experience the ups and downs of college. I cannot help but feel alienated from the very community I am in. It is the feeling that nobody is there for me when I want to socialize or hang out with someone. I have friends outside of school but the situation I am in perpetuates the feeling of loneliness. Moreover, freshmen year can be a breeding ground for Instagram posts. I would open my app and see uploads of people having fun and enjoying themselves. Although the posts may not reflect the emotions others feel all the time, it is still difficult to dissociate the feeling that others are having fun, but I am not. 

&amp;#x200B;

### How do I Cope with Loneliness?

I am learning to be comfortable alone and it is difficult. However, I do realize the slew of benefits that comes with being alone and I am trying my best to focus on the good. FOMO is real but I do not have to let it control my life. Being alone has nothing to do with my personality, my ability to make friends, or loving myself.

I used to consume mindless entertainment or spend my time with fair-weathered friends whenever I felt lonely. These temporary comforts brought nothing but emotional unfulfillment. In hindsight, I deprived myself of precious self-reflection time. Clear answers and true internal reflection can only happen during a period of solitude with no distractions. Being alone gives me the time to better understand my thought process, understand myself, and regulate my emotions. Meanwhile, I now have the opportunity to create meaningful work and it has injected purpose into my life. I can see my loneliness for what it is instead; that I simply have time for myself to do or create what I want.

There may be an expectation to meet your best friends at orientation and start school with a large group of friends. It is highly unrealistic, and it is perfectly okay if you did not find people you would vibe with. Real friends are hard to come by. That is why when we meet people we click with; we recognize that it is special and will sincerely work on the relationship.

## Conclusion:

Although I cannot banish these feelings completely, I believe that we can have open conversations about the challenges students face in college. With increasing awareness of how common these experiences are, perhaps we can feel freer to be frank about our feelings and build confidence in simple truths. I am capable, I deserve to be in college, and it is okay to be alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/jugpfb/college_is_hard_and_these_are_my_struggles_in_nus/,1.0,"[""I'm here if you ever need someone to talk to, OP.\n\n^(I'm a little lonely too :()""]"

I am not taking CS1010E this sem. But I took it last sem and failed. Im planning to remod next sem. I am terribly worried about getting an F again. The thought of getting an F again is haunting me almost everyday... Can't believe i cant even handle a 1k mod. All the posts about people struggling badly this sem too makes me just wanna cry not knowing whats waiting for me next sem.  I know i sound like a loser but I just suck at coding. I don't think anyone would have taken the same mod 3 times but I dont wanna be the first one to do that. My cap rn is about 3.6 which is not good either. I want to do better next sem, Im planning to start studying for CS1010E right after this sem's finals are over.  But I feel like CS is really a skill that is just not for everyone 😢😢 I really don't want to get an F one more time for the exact same mod, it will crush my self-esteem by a lot... I'm sure there will be people replying to this saying i'm just whining and im such a loser...",https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/jpllzx/cs1010e_again/,1.0,['was the F because of the cs1010e cheating saga last sem?']
