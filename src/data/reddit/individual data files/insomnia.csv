I haven't been able to sleep well for the past few days and I even have nightmares about my results.

I am scared, scared to face my results. I don't want to disappoint anyone. I don't want to be devestated about my results. I don't want to hate myself. My anxiety increases every day.

I try to distract myself each day but I can't help but to overthink and break down. I keep telling myself that I didn't study enough.

What I did was set a time for myself every day, like maybe 30 minutes to an hour(closer to result release day), and spend the time thinking about my life and the past year leading up to my Os and As. I write down all of my regrets, what I wish to change about myself and what to do if I get the worst results. Once that reflection time is over, I forget about it and move on with my life.

2,SGExams,36565,[uni] existential crisis,go1ljm,cy3n,1590083489,5,1,"Took As last year with subject combi pcmg and got a score of CBB/E and gp S. Accepted sutd in early april. 

However, circuit breaker has given me the opportunity to take a step back and reflect. Lately,I've been thinking if I'm truly satisfied with my results etc.

The short answer is not really,but I've done my best at that point of time. (Had alot of mental health complications aka anxiety and insomnia last year in july.needless to say ,preparing for As was a trainwreck) 

Is it advisable to: 
1) retake my h1 next year(since registration for this year is over)  (possibly switching it to something else like art because I hate geog with a burning passion but was too naive and dumb at the age of 17 to go for what I like) 

2) and take a gap year?

3) or if possible,retake the h1 exams after I graduate

I feel like retaking h1 will give me a chance to prove something to myself I guess? I guess the reason is quite shallow :-/

3,SGExams,35271,[O LEVELS] Early Admission Exercise,ggjn7n,cherylljx,1589045370,9,1,"previously posted something similar under the o level flair but i realised more people were looking for help to apply for EAE under the poly flair. im also having serious insomnia i cant sleep so i thought i'd spend my time tryna help yall out. 

hello o level students, yall definitely heard about your teachers telling you about EAE. i'll be sharing some experiences my friends and i had, and hopefully it'll answer some questions you have / had. 

you will first need to submit and application through the EAE portal around late June. you are to choose 3 courses across all polys, and submit a write up of 800 characters* (i will need to check on this again), on reasons why you chose the courses as one of yoir options. afterwards you can include a paragraphof 200 words to highlight some of your achievements in school, does not have to be related to academic. 

around mid July, polys will have start contacting you for interview and/or aptitude test(s). its possible thay you are being contacted by all polys / or none at all.

for aptitude tests, you will be tested on things like general knowledge, and can be some knowledge regarding your course too. the results of your aptitude test determines whether you should get called for interview(s). 

the interview is the nerve wrecking one. your grades for MYE doesnt matter. your portfolio and your performance during the interview are the most crucial parts.

what to include for portfolio
- report book containing recent result slips
- certificates to highlight your achievements in school ( not necessarily academic related)
- cca records indicating your cca points
- testimonials, can request them from your teachers
- bonus : certificates of participation of events related to your course

solo interviews
- 1 to 1 
- you need to be confident
- able to express your sincerity

group interviews
- can be up to 5 students
- most probably need to show that you take initiative and can work well with people 


common questions asked (IMPORTANT!)
- can you do a short introduction of yourself?
- why did you choose this course?
- what made you choose this course?
- what do you want to do upon graduating from this course?
- what do you know about this course?
- what do you hope to learn from this course?

interviewers may ask some questions related to your portfolio too.

your results of the interview will only come out in mid August - late August, and you will only be offered ONE of your choices. there is no appeal for EAE, so you have to either accept or reject the course offered in 3 days. 

my class of 16, almost all of us were called for aptitude tests and/or interviews, and we shared our experience with one another. here's how its like; 

engineering courses
- aptitude tests on general knowledge and physics
- interview questions mostly related to the course

design courses
- aptitude tests to come up with a design within a given timing
- must express creativity in your work

humanities and social sci courses (early childhood, community development etc)
- need to work in groups during interview
- need to be outspoken and show that you can no problem working with others

applied sci courses
- interviewers might ask about your sci results
- might ask questions related to your other two choices for EAE
- biomed courses might have aptitude tests

IT related courses
- aptitude tests related to general knowledge and/or knowledge something related to the course

other useful tips

1) stress, anxiety, mixed feelings
inevitable. remember to relax. getting all tensed up during aptitude tests and interview will not do you any good.

2) be careful with the deadlines
deadlines are extremely important. a few minutes late could result you in losing an opportunity. 

3) punctuality
do not be late for the test / interview. leaves a bad impression on interview. advisable to arrive 15 mins before the stated time.

4) attire for interview
best if you can wear your school uniform. if you dont want to, wear something smart. long sleeves and pants for boys, blouse and long skirt for girls.

4,SGExams,34980,[rant][uni] approaching mental health in uni,gepb2m,cy3n,1588788929,2,1,"To be very frank I'm quite scared of uni

Some background : 
Was diagnosed with anxiety and insomnia in July 19' after a few sudden episodes of sleepless nights (longest record 4 days) 

Seeked help from the school,teachers,counsellors, psychiatrist and changed medication 4 times 

Took As the same year and scraped passed it

On New Year's,got drunk and managed to pass out at 5 am without having to take medication for the first time in 6 months 

Now: Ive been sober of sleeping medications for 5 months now 

I've also secured a place at sutd and will most likely be attending this year
* (I've written an essay regarding this under the application,discussed about the matter as it was relevant to the question she asked me) 
*I declared my health status for ntu and nus because I was very sure I wanted to attend one of them but in the end ,I picked sutd (the school I applied on a wimp and didn't offically declare my health status) 
*I also thought that my sleep issue would get better at that this year, but at this point it's quite unpredictable 

even though I can sleep on most nights nowadays doesn't mean that I might be able to during sch , esp when there's gg to be alot of stress accumulated.

I tend to be really stressed over exams and subconsciously think about it,hence I can't really shut up my brain because it would think of the info I would have to recall the next day .can't imagine how everything will be like under the crushing pressure of school. 

I've tried ways to make myself exhausted to the max, taking multiple jobs(supermarket,tutoring) to adopting new routines (listening to login hip-hop,sleeping with the lights on etc) 

I don't really know what to do,whether to take my meds again etc.

5,SGExams,28623,[A Levels] the vicious cycle of underperforming.,f7oywv,bookofusentropy,1582353933,27,1,"I feel absolutely lost and I really don't know what the fuck to do now. 

I didn't do badly, but I didn't do very well either - which fucking sucks, given the amount of effort that I had put into my studies. I would call myself a person who believes in hard work and consistency - I've been studying really hard even during J1 year, and that didn't stop into J2 year. So what went wrong? I'm honestly so fucking sick of seeing people who fool around a lot or only begin to cram at the very last minute always perform better than myself - it seems like it's been a common occurence since secondary school. My O level results weren't bad, but they weren't that great, either - I really hate that I have failed to make that change for my A level. This applied even for the SAT test that I took the last year - I did so many practice tests and studied so rigorously, only to end up falling short again, caught in between the good and the bad. I hate feeling so fucking disappointed in myself over and over again. I hate that I'm seeing the same pattern repeat itself over and over again. I have another test that I'd signed up for in a few months' time, one that I've been working really hard for -  I've been trying to move on and keep my mind of yesterday, but my feeling of self-doubt and self-hatred has been relentlessly thrumming in my mind and keeping me up all night - I'm honestly so terrified to see myself fall short again. It's becoming a recurring trend that I can't seem to have control over, one that I can't seem to change.

I know that I'm not stupid - I have a lot of interests, I can pick up and do a lot of things, I know how to work my way around things, I do alright on block tests. I'm a runner, I'm a dancer, I'm an artist, I'm a writer, I'm a violinist, I like animals and volunteering at animal shelters, I like singing and listening to music  So what is wrong with me? I used to think of myself as a relatively academic person, though definitely less so in the recent years - well, I guess I never really knew myself after all. After seeing my results yesterday, I know that I'll have a very low chance for getting a scholarship - I didn't think it was necessary nor did I need to hear it to know, but here's what my father scoffed at me yesterday, reiterating my worst fears - ""Yeah, you try to apply with these kind of scores, see who wants you???"" It was very unlike him, making it especially disheartening and heart-wrenching to hear coming from him. I later overheard him telling my mum, ""We give her so many thing and so many resources and she still can produce these kind of results???"" and I honestly feel really, really bad - like, I'm sorry that I'm not good enough, I'm sorry that I'm constantly disappointing you over and over again, I'm sorry that I can never seem to be an ideal daughter that you can be proud of. I think that he hates me now, but I really don't blame him at all - it's true that he and the rest of my family has given me so much, in terms of love and support - and all I've done is let them down over and over again. It really fucking sucks that I never seem to be able to break out of this vicious cycle of me constantly underperforming even though I have the potential to do better - I don't blame him at all. I completely understand how he feels - I do hate myself too.

I'm doing an internship right now, one which leads up to a potential scholarship, but even though the company has reassured us that grades do not matter that much, I know that deep down, they do and it's something they're definitely scrutinising - I'm pretty sure my grades has already put me at a severe disadvantage alongside all the other better and smarter candidates, and that it won't be long before I'm completely kicked off the list. On another note, I've been having doubts about a career here as well, which would me mandatory should I be offered and accept a scholarship from this company - I feel stifled sometimes by the traditional and conservative way of things. So I'm honestly stuck and conflicted about what to do now - should I just stay on for the sake of gaining more internship experience and just see how it goes with the scholarship? Or should I just leave already and do something else sincr I already know that I'm already at a disadvantage as compared to my amazing friends?

Even though I have done well enough to enter quite a few university courses, I'm honestly considering taking a break from academics to work for two years and earn money to fund my own university education - I'm so done with the Singaporean education system and I really do think that I need a breather sometimes. I cannot count the number of times that I have relapsed into bouts of depressive and suicidal thoughts rife with self-hatred and self-deprecation, into bouts of panic attacks in the school toilets, into night terrors or insomnia that keeps me up awake throughout my JC life - I'm really scared that this, akin to my constant inability to perform up to expectations even though I know deep down that I have it in me, would as well become a recurring pattern that would haunt me into adulthood - I feel like I have the right now be selfish and do things my way for once. To not follow the conventional route and way of things, the one that our society has engineeered each and every one of us to gear towards - I want to be in control instead of being controlled for once. 

So sorry for the really long rant, but I honestly can't keep it to myself and hope to know if there's anyone out there who can relate and feel something similar. I've never been an expressive or emotional person in real life, so it's really difficult for me to pour out my heartfelt thoughts and feelings to anyone in real life - it's so uncomfortable for me.

where do i begin? o levels are in 3 days, and i haven't been studying properly. honestly? i just feel like giving up and killing myself for real lol. so much has been happening and esp with o's everything just caused me to relapse a few days ago. i have no idea what to do. i was so set on getting into a particular course a few mths ago but after getting rejected by eae, and seeing my friends get accepted into the same course even though they did the bare minimum (i'm sorry), all that determination just flew straight out the window. and i just know that my score won't be fantastic either, i'm aiming for 10-11 points but i honestly feel that i'll score over 26. my scores aren't even good enough to begin with, for prelims i got c5-c6 for everything and failed math, and combined ss+geog with f9 and e8 respectively. if i don't pass math i can't go anywhere, but why is it that i can't bring myself to study for math? i don't even have -2 points, i only have -1 since i've never gotten a leadership role in sec sch. i hear all my friends putting in such hard work meanwhile i'm here slacking away. i've deleted all my social media, yet i can't seem to focus.

i've been having such bad insomnia and panic attacks the past 2 weeks during study break. i have to hide these bc my mum caught me once and told me she feels no sympathy towards me since i'm not studying, so it happens every night while everyone is asleep. to be fair, she's right. she shouldn't sympathise with me panicking because it's my choice not to study. i honestly don't know what to do anymore. despite me worrying over o's, i can't study. been reading posts on here seeing everyone talking about mugging, and then there's myself who mopes around in bed and cries. i'm so scared for this upcoming monday. i'm shaking while typing this haha lol.

the worst part is that i do feel a sense of urgency and i know that i should be studying my hardest and best. but every time i go to the study table to start, i just crash. sorry to say but i rlly dk what's wrong with me and atp i'm just ready to end it all. i don't see a future for myself. i'm sorry to bring such a negative thing onto this tl(?) but i just can't keep it in anymore. thanks for listening :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jbtw5n/rant_whats_wrong_with_me/,1.0,"['\nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out.

Because when one has a panicked attack,they won't be able to focus and when they can't focus they can't do well and when they can't do well results can topple. When results topples, suicidal thoughts kicks in and when it kicks in more depressed people tend to commit suicide.

8,SGExams,48817,[A Levels] [O Levels] Some final words of encouragement...,j4zyqc,zireaelciri,1601822418,1,1," Hiya!

&amp;#x200B;

Some of y'all may remember me as one of the co-writers of the 2-part PCME study guide posted here a while back *(if haven't seen them yet, they're pinned under my profile!)*. Don't worry, I'm not going to talk any more about PCME, I'm done with that. I'm here with some final words of encouragement for all of you, yes including you O-Level kiddos. These are more... intangible things? that I have learned from my experience at A's. I've tried to write in a more narrative way to make it easier to read through, but I apologise in advance if I made you cringe instead of feeling better! Here goes...

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. You don’t have to shoulder this alone

During this stressful lead-up to the exams, it’s all too easy to lose sight of the people around you. Every fact, statistic or formula you remember displaces from your memory a friend in need or a shoulder you can lean on. You forget that your friends are struggling alongside you, that tens of thousands of other students are fighting your same battle, and that you are not alone. 

As you continue preparing for the exams, do remember to check on the people you care for. 

Be generous and forthcoming with your guidance, because every little gesture goes a long way in an environment where everyone is fixated on their own outcomes. Plus, teaching others is one of the best ways of revising, so what you have is really just a win-win situation.

Do not be afraid to reach out for help, because most people will be glad to lend a helping hand.  If it seems like people are reluctant, chances are it’s because your own needs become less salient when everyone else is facing similar problems. They get stressed and have bad days too, just like us. Be patient and forgiving, and never close yourself off.

Even if it may not feel like it, you do have people around you. It doesn’t matter if it’s family, friends, teachers, a significant other, or other SGExams users in the same boat as you. As you continue cramming your head with information, remember to vacate some space for these people that you care about. You don’t have to shoulder all this weight alone.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Let it unravel before you

If you are like me, you must be familiar with the episodes of crippling anxiety when the entire combined weight of the futility of your two years (or four years for O-levels) of hard work, the impossibility of the exams, and the hopelessness of your near future seem to be pressing down on you all at once. And you probably also know that these episodes are *not fun.* 

Though, there is something I’ve realised during some of my darkest times:

There are certain things we can control, and for every one thing we can control, there are many more things that we cannot. Acknowledge and accept your fears; they are completely valid. Once you have accepted them, though, you have to loosen your grasp on them and let them go. 

Maybe you just don’t have enough time to complete your revision. Maybe the dreaded insomnia sneaks up on you and your mind goes completely blank during your best paper. Maybe you won’t get your desired grades, let alone your dream University (or school).

All the worries in your head are not unfounded and you are justified in feeling the way you do, but also realise that these things are well beyond your control. Mulling over them will only cloud your vision and prevent you from performing at your complete, unbridled best.

If you shift your focus to the things that are within your control, like how productive you are or how much sleep you get each day, everything becomes more manageable. You’d be surprised at how much progress you can make once you give these controllable factors your undivided attention.

During these moments when you are at your lowest, let everything you’ve painstakingly woven together unravel slowly before you. Let your efforts go to waste. Let the dreaded days come and go. Let what you are most afraid of wash over and engulf you, and emerge renewed from it.  “Come what may”, or... something like that.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Do not go down without a fight

*“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.”* 

So what if you have been procrastinating a lot? If people have already started way before you and it seems like you’re late? You may have missed that proverbial “best time to plant a tree”, and each passing day you delay your starting is another missed opportunity, but the fact remains that the *next best time* is the present. In times like these when you don’t have much of a choice, the second-best option seems pretty appealing.

*“Do not go gentle into that good night.”*

In exams, we are often unsure of our answers, and it would take an unlimited number of second-guesses, or the running out of prescribed exam time - whichever comes first - to force us to make a decision. Other times, the only thing that we are certain of is that we are *completely* and *utterly screwed*, and that no amount of divine intervention can save us.

Even if you know for a fact that everything is going down in flames, you do not go down without a fight. Sometimes, the more convinced you are of your failure, the more you struggle against it. You will fight down to your last breath, because it is better to do so than to give in sheepishly and let all your years of hard work dissolve before you.

Two things define us: one, the unrelenting courage to take what we perceive to be a lost fight straight on; and two, the dogged defiance we show in the face of an inevitability.

It doesn’t matter how little time you have left, or what mountainous tasks lie ahead of you. If you start now and give it your all, you should be proud of yourself regardless of the outcome, because you have shown that unique tenacity which makes us human.

There is no “lost cause” or “foregone conclusion” when you are still fighting. The eventual outcomes are uncontrollables. What you can control is whether you go gently into the good night, or rage against it.

*“Lose the battle, win the war.”*

A short but necessary disclaimer: there are times when you have to take your losses and give in. Know your limits - there are certain fundamental, inviolable “rights” that every pitiable student reserves, namely to sleep and to take a break when needed. If you are tired from studying, order a retreat and head to bed, and continue the battle the next day. If you burn out, embrace your loss graciously, take a well-deserved break and have some fun, and then resume the campaign once your fire has rekindled. When it comes to the long haul, though, you give nothing short of your very best.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Fake it till you make it

It’s difficult to be confident when you feel like you’re the only one flailing about the water while everyone else effortlessly remains afloat. You have somehow fallen off an unsinkable ship while the rest on board continue merrily on their journey. 

I can ask you to be confident in yourself, but “easier said than done” would be a massive understatement here. How can you be confident when you’ve been failing all along? When everything you do turns out to be a mistake? When your classmates or friends outperform you at virtually everything that can be compared?

Sometimes, the only way to be confident is to fake it till you make it. Quite literally, you pretend that you are confident, and act exactly like how a confident person would. Yes, this sounds like a steaming pile of bullshit, but hear me out:

Tell yourself each day that you can make it, even if these blatant lies leave a bitter aftertaste in your mouth. Stop asking around and comparing your grades or answers with others, and be certain of your own abilities, even if you know for sure that comparing would reveal your inferiority. Walk into the exam hall with your head held high and shoulders squared, even if you feel like the least prepared person in that hall.

Over time, this false confidence becomes an acquired habit, and something you can call your own. It’s weird, but it’s much easier to develop confidence intrinsically once doing “confident things” has become second nature.

You are not someone who has fallen off the ship; you are your own vessel carving your own path through the waves. You are still perfectly fine even if everyone else has given up on you, because the most important person is yourself: you are the only constant among many variables as you face different adversities in life. The day that you forsake yourself is the day that you lose your best friend and your voice.

Let your self-confidence outshine the combined disapproval and scepticism of your non-believers. You can go farther than you can ever imagine; much, much farther than your wildest dreams.

5. Tara Westover’s story

This is less of something I’ve learned from experience and more of an inspiring story I had recently come across and wanted to share. It also ties in nicely with what I have written so far.

Tara Westover, author of the bestseller “Educated”, grew up in rural, survivalist Idaho (a state in the U.S.) in a family that was fanatically religious. They were sceptical and even fearful of institutions that run contrary to their beliefs, like the government, hospitals, or public schools. Her delusional parents would do absurd things like refusing to send her siblings to hospital even when they were seriously injured, instead opting to “heal” them with essential oils; and stocking up food and weapons in preparation for the “end of the world” as prophesied by their religion. 

As part of their unorthodox parenting, she was homeschooled from young, and had to self-study for the ACT to get into a public college. She set foot in her first-ever classroom at the age of **17**. Naturally, it was an uphill struggle - she had to manage both her finances and studies while grappling with her gradual distancing from her family, both in trust and ideology. It was not smooth-sailing at all, and I really don’t know how she did it - maybe it was the resilience she developed growing up in a difficult household, or the timely help and guidance of several important people in her life - but she managed to outdo herself by graduating from college, and eventually getting a PhD from Cambridge (she had a brief stint in Harvard University as well). 

I find Tara’s story particularly inspiring because it shows that even someone with such a late start can go so far. Seeing the long and rocky journey she had to take to educate herself about the outside world beyond her sheltered, distorted childhood reminds me that big changes only happen in small steps, and that there is always a way up no matter how many times you have fallen. If you ever feel like you are too old to learn something new, or - more relevant for us right now - that it is too late to start preparing for your exams, let her story be that quiet voice that tells you in your head that no, it’s not too late, it’s never too late, and everything that you do from today onwards will be completely worth it in the end. 

As a side note, once your exams are over, I would highly recommend her book “Educated”. I don’t know how else to describe her writing besides “beautiful”, and it’s also written with so much sincerity and vulnerability that I could not get over her story for many days.

If you have made it to the end, thank you! I know it may sound all solemn and gloomy, and y’all probably feel extra bad with Covid and all, but cheer up! Remember that there’s a whole world waiting for you post-A’s (or O’s). There’s always light at the tunnel, and soon you can breathe freely again (still with a mask on, though). And no matter how things turn out, always keep your head held high. Be proud of yourself, because I’m proud of you too!

During this As period, for almost every paper, I struggled (and am still struggling rn) to fall asleep. With it being 2:12am now and with econs in less than 6 hours im petrified. Gotta deal with bio after that too. For the previous papers, I've tried everything to get myself to sleep. Going to bed an hour earlier, melatonin, chamomile tea, slow breathing techniques, exercising in the evening, even alcohol. But it's had mixed effects. For GP, I sorta died and couldn't finish my AQ. For Math it was a shitshow too haha. Ironically for Chem and Math p2 (which i practised alot for) i slept well. Then these two weeks the insomnia came back.

11,SGExams,53059,[O Levels] Unable to sleep,jj785b,maddest-hatter,1603824669,6,1,"I'm not stressed or anything, I just took a 4 hour power nap and now I can't fall asleep. To cope with this sudden insomnia, I'm going to list down all my bio points for everyone else's reference because I want everyone to do well.

Gene:
A gene is a sequence of nucleotides, small segment of DNA which controls the formation of a single polypeptide. 

DNA: 
A molecule carrying genetic code. It has a double helix structure comprised of two polynucleotide strands. Each nucleotide in a polynucleotide strand contains a nitrogenous base, deoxyribose sugar and a phosphate group. The rules of base pairing is adenine pairs with thymine and cytosine pairs with guanine. 

Chromosome: 
A chromosome is a thread-like structure made up of DNA. A DNA molecule wrapped around proteins forms a chromatin thread.

How transgenic bacteria is produced:
Example: Insulin-producing bacteria
A human insulin gene is extracted from human DNA using restriction enzymes, which produces sticky ends on the insulin gene. Then, a plasmid is extracted from bacteria and cut with the same restriction enzyme, producing sticky ends complementary to those of the human insulin gene. The insulin gene is then inserted in the plasmid and sealed with DNA ligase. The recombinant plasmid is then inserted back into the bacteria by subjecting the bacteria to temporary heat or electric shock, which opens up small holes in its cell membrane for the plasmid to go through. The transgenic bacteria is then placed into the fermenter (broth, temperature and pH level etc. of the fermenter must be kept constant) to reproduce into generations of transgenic bacteria.

Homeostasis:
The maintenance of a constant internal environment which is independent from external changes.

When blood glucose level deviates from the norm:
When blood glucose concentration deviates from the norm, this stimulates the Islets of Langerhans (correct if I'm wrong) in the pancreas, which secretes insulin when blood glucose concentration is high and glucagon when blood glucose concentration is low. Insulin and glucagon travels through the bloodstream into the liver, where excess glucose is converted into glycogen or storage with the help of insulin, or where stored glycogen is converted into glucose with the help of glucagon. This brings the blood glucose concentration back to norm levels and maintains the internal environment of the body.

When water potential of blood deviates from norm:
When water potential is too low:
When water potential in the blood is too low, it stimulates the hypothalamus which sends nerve signals to the pituitary gland to secrete excess ADH* (anti-diuretic hormone). ADH causes the cells in the walls of the collecting duct in the nephron to become more permeable to water, hence causing more water to be selectively reabsorbed into the bloodstream, which thus increases the water potential of the blood. The water potential of the blood is restored to the norm and the internal environment of the body is maintained.

When water potential is too high:
When water potential in the blood is too high, it stimulates the hypothalamus which sends nerve signals to the pituitary gland to secrete less ADH* (anti-diuretic hormone). ADH causes the cells in the walls of the collecting duct in the nephron to become more permeable to water, hence decrease in ADH causes less water to be selectively reabsorbed into the bloodstream, which thus decreases the water potential of the blood. The water potential of the blood is restored to the norm and the internal environment of the body is maintained.

*Note that ADH will always be secreted, it just depends if more or less is being secreted.


When body temperature becomes too high:
(Became lazy so I'm putting this in point form)
**Receptor: Hypothalamus**
-Sweat glands become more active, thus sweat is secreted and heat will be lost through evaporation of water in the sweat 
-The shunt vessels in the arterioles will undergo vasoconstriction while the capillaries near the skin surface will vasodilate, hence more blood is transported to the surface of the skin and heat loss will occur through conduction, convection and radiation.
-The body will also reduce its metabolic reactions to prevent heat from being released within the body. (I will add on to this)

When body temperature becomes too low:
-Sweat glands become less active, less sweat is secreted to prevent excess heat loss through evaporation of water in sweat.
-The shunt vessels in the arterioles will undergo vasodilation, while the capillaries near the skin surface will vasoconstriction, this prevents transportation of blood near skin surface as well as excess heat loss through skin surface by conduction, convection and radiation.
-The body will also increase its rate of metabolic reactions to release heat to keep the body warm.

Digestion:
Enzymes in saliva:
Salivary amylase
(Converts starch to maltose)

Enzymes in stomach:
Pepsin
(Digests proteins)

Digestion in Duodenum:
Bile: Secreted by the gallbladder, produced by the liver and emulsifies fats into small fat droplets

Pancreatic juice: Trypsin (Digests proteins), pancreatic amylase and pancreatic lipase (Digests fats into fatty acids and glycerol

In the Ileum:
Absorption of digested food substances

In the Large Intestine:
Absorption of water and other mineral salts

Intestinal juice: Maltase (Digests maltose into glucose), intestinal lipase and peptidase (Digests peptides into amino acids)

The other day, i forgot to bring my curve ruler so he happened to be around me and i asked him. He lent it to me and thanked me instead of the other way round. Afterwards, he told me about why his calculator was not allowed in the exam for paper 2. He seemed like he wasn't a retaker because he brought in a calculator which was meant for JC and could potentially display graphs. When i was packing my bag to leave, i could feel his eyes looking at me and wanted to strike a conversation. However, i was really shy and i just walked away. I truly regret not telling him that the English LC was my last paper. He might be thinking I am still coming for the rest of the papers.

So I have been diagnosed with anxiety and chronic insomnia 2 days after my myes started  
As in I would have major episodes of not being able to sleep for 30-50 hours at a go 
It also started right before my very myes first paper(needless to say I bombed that paper but some how scraped through chem p3? I think it's funny lmao) 
Okay anyways 
I was away from school for the whole month of July,meaning I missed out on myes and many lessons 
Aka I'm behind 
By quite.a.lot 
I've been getting help from the psychiatrist and school counsellors,aka changing my medication 3 different times with different side effects 
And sometimes the cocktail of drugs wouldn't even be strong enough to out me asleep 
Currently,I started school two weeks ago
Work is tough to catch up,and it sucks to see your peers being able to stay in school and mug 
Or being on task/kiasu-ism etc 
Sometimes ill go to school not being able to sleep at all 
Sometimes ill wake up 2-3 times a night and find it extremely difficult to fall back asleep,hence, getting up at 4 am to do work and going to school at 6 am 
By the end of the school day I'll be to exhausted to do anything but craving sweet sweet sleep badly 
I'm currently trying my best to complete work and exercise,while maintaining my emotions 
(Eg trying to learn nuclear physics almost 1 week before they give a lecture quiz on it event though you haven't attended any of the lectures and have no idea what's going on in lessons are fun while having to worry about 20 other pieces of work) (but ahaha it's okay now I'm getting the hang of it) (not to mention I've forgotten alot of what I've studied for myes due to the month's worth of inconsistent well rested and not rested nights)  
Some of my jc friend know 
Most of my classmates don't know 
My school knows and I'm blessed that they are helpful and understanding  
But I guess idk I feel demoralized in that sense almost everybody is like 1000 steps ahead of me 
While I'm trying to take it what is happening,what had happen and juggle my academics 
Most people told me to retake j2 
But I worry things could get worse 
And I want to pursue what makes me happy because honestly I want to get a career asap and help those who may be in my position (if that makes any sense or it could be a form of escapism) 
Doesn't help that prelims are in 1 month 
Caffeine doesn't really help in the morning (I'm allowed to take it only in the morning) 
So by the time I get home 
Even though I can function (sort of) 
I'm left tired 
But I don't want to back down 
What is the point of this post you may ask? 
I'm not here to paint a flowery picture,saying things will get better as long you get help and put your mind and soul into anything you do. 
I'm here to say that if you are strong.We can do this.Even to the people who are functioning just fine but are on the verge of breaking mentally,take a step back and breathe. 
Life is unpredictable 
Let's view our future as a grey area 
Because I tend to think everyone thinks it's either black or white 
In my case ,retake j2(not that it's a bad thing) or deal with it and graduate(which also may not be the best)
I'm just ranting at this point but those taking any major exams soon,rest well,exercise a positive mindset and carry on

Night before the GP exam I had a severe bout of insomnia and could not sleep at all. Literally, not a single minute of sleep. I was certain it would be sodomy if I sat for the paper as I felt like the walking dead and so I decided that my best option was to call in sick and skip the paper, hoping that Cambridge would award me a grade by extrapolating from my prelim results. I came really close to doing this but my parents talked me out of it, and so I sat for the exam with no expectations whatsoever.

Paper 1 was meh. The topics that came out I hadn’t specifically prepared for. My writing felt uninspired as I was exhausted from not sleeping at all the night before. My essay was also incomplete as I ran out of time before I could finish my last point. 

Paper 2 was even worse. SAQs were manageable but I had completely butchered the AQ. Though I had allocated more than enough time for it, I had chosen the wrong stand and had a lot of difficulty elaborating on my point. Time was ticking and with less than 10 minutes to go, I made the rash decision to cancel and redo my entire AQ. Long story short, my AQ was 4 lines long when time was up.

So to recap, I — did not sleep at all, planned on skipping the paper, did not complete my essay, wrote only 4 lines for AQ and was in zombie mode caused by sleep deprivation the entire time. Indeed, it would be surprising if your paper went as badly as mine — but not as surprising as the fact that I still got an A. Yup, even after all of that, I somehow got an A for GP.

I am a year 1 student trying my best to succeed academically in university. I am still in my first semester and just finished week 11. If you guys read through this and think you might know who is it in real life that posted this, please do not say it out. You can PM me but please respect my privacy. This is all very personal stuff and I'm only asking for tips to survive Uni bcos I really don't want to get to the point of attempting suicide... 

Feeling so tired and drained out and yet I don't want my peers who see me around Uni to know I am actually struggling a lot and have thoughts of suicide so I try to look normal and as happy as I can as I want to spread only positivity and not negativity. Furthermore, many of my friends are stressed as Finals are coming up soon in a month's time so I don't want to confide in most of them and I know things have been quite hard for them to manage as well. 

I have been receiving a lot of help in Uni but it makes me feel like I am a very needy student that can't be independent and strong enough to cope with Uni life and I hate myself for that. I wish I didn't need to live anymore...

My history of depression and anxiety came from my personality as I am naturally anxious and get easily upset. I am very sensitive too.

But it was worsened due to bullying in primary school and academic stress as well as in secondary school. My ex classmates would avoid me, laugh and mock me and even my suicide attempt in primary school and made something called a ""virus"" where people don't want to be in contact with me.

Secondary school was even worse and I had been told to commit suicide, cut myself and even got physically hurt by a guy who threw a chair and it hit my left arm. Psychologically, it brought on a lot of trauma and stress and I developed PTSD from it that until now I have recurrent nightmares and flashbacks relating to school. 

JC was better in the sense it was just rumour spreading and unwarranted hate but the students in my jc didn't dare to do much.

All along, i have been struggling with the support of school, family and mental health professionals. 
I am also taking medications to cope with the mental illnesses that never seem to go away. 

The anxiety I face in Uni continues and gets worse as Uni module contents are very heavy and the workload is a lot, more so than JC. I am just lucky that I am taking a course and modules that I like and am passionate about or it might have been far more difficult for me... I feel suicidal out of the blue and the sudden anxiety and panic attacks come, apart from the constant anxiety, apprehension, fear, uneasiness and stress and its affecting my sleep. I sleep very late at night as the insomnia is damn bad and I wake up exhausted too. Sometimes I feel sad even when I feel happy a minute ago and when things are going well, I feel sad for no reason and ready to die. 

Has anyone felt this way? I hope that I'm not the only person struggling now... 
And any tips to do well in Uni without getting too stressed and how can I make time to take care of my mental health before it continues to get worse?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/dqhb63/uni_dealing_with_mental_health_issues/,0.0,"['This is really sad to hear, those people who bullied u are utter jerks.

24,SGExams,8044,[A Levels] Insomnia the night before a paper?,9yfnrg,pragmaticpapaya,1542623799,23,1,"Ok this has been bothering me for quite a while, out of the 4 papers I've sat for so far, I had trouble falling asleep the night before for 2 out of 4 papers mainly because I became too anxious when I'm in bed, and I lay awake for hours in bed before finally being knocked out.

People always tell you how important it is to have at least 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep before an exam, and the lack thereof can impede your performance. The problem is, this belief became so ingrained in me that when I realise I'm still wide awake after an hour or two in bed and that I'll be getting less than 6 hours of actual sleep, I start panicking and this exacerbates my anxiety, I become so tormented by this and it is akin to a living nightmare.

Can't tell for sure if insomnia had affected my performance for my previous papers, but I remember feeling dead tired when I woke up in the morning of my Lit paper 3, and my mood before the paper was to 'get it over and be done with' rather than to try my best.

It's so frustrating that I feel so powerless and I'm at the mercy of my own brain, tried several sleeping/relaxation techniques but none of it seems to work at the moment. I still have 4 more papers to go starting tomorrow, and I feel that I all I can do is to pray that I'll magically fall asleep in no time and I feel rested enough before the I sit for the paper.

Anyone else going/had gone through this? How did y'all cope with it, and any tips to beat anxiety and insomnia that worked for y'all?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/9yfnrg/a_levels_insomnia_the_night_before_a_paper/,0.0,"['I have similar experience.

25,SGExams,7514,[A LEVELS] trouble sleeping,9waeqs,Waddlesand,1541993442,33,1,"Here's my battle with insomnia.

So far I've had 3 papers and all 3 times I struggled to sleep. Before GP I woke up at 3am and stayed awake from 3-6. My brain only warmed up after p1 so I guess half my GP grade is down the drain. Before Math I went to bed at 11+ and only slept close to 3am. Today for Chem, I don't think I slept (like go unconscious) at all.

What's common during these 3 nights was the excruciating agony and total vulnerability. Most of my thoughts were ""holy shit if you don't sleep you're gonna get fucked tmr (I know the stress backfires when you're trying to sleep but I just can't control it)"" or ""maybe I do have depression"". I also feel this permanent dull ache on my head.

I am honestly really shocked that I reacted this adversely to exams. I think my brain acted this way bc I had a lot of suppressed frustrations (academically/relationship w others/w my own body etc) and exam stress just amplified these feelings and idk how to continue coping anymore. It's like I know I can rise up to challenges and perform well bc I have done so in the past and I have a lot of grit. But when something as big and debilitating as insomnia and an overwhelming sense of helplessness creeps up on me...I just can't.

I guess the point of me posting this is to hopefully find some respite. For those who are battling or have battled with insomnia, plsplspls share your story (or pm me). I meditate everyday and it doesn't seem to work.

2,singapore,247489,Where can my dad go from here?,hkhyai,satanspebble,1593778219,34,1,"Hello friends, I usually lurk but I've recently been thinking about some frustrating things and thought I'd share in the hopes that I'd be able to gather some advice.

So my dad (54 years old) has been self-employed since 2003. He ran a restaurant for a few years but it folded in the early 2000s. He then did a whole host of other freelance jobs, most recently settling for being a canteen vendor for the last few years. He only has an O levels cert and no other skills upgrading under his belt.

Lately, the canteen hasn't been doing well, especially in recent months because of covid. Even before covid, business was getting worse too because i think school enrollment fell and students also are more inclined to order in food/buy from the coffee shop nearby. I think the pay can be lived on, but I can honestly see my dad getting more tired and dejected, especially since he has to wake up early at 4/5am and go to school to prepare food. My mum goes along to help him and I can tell it really drains her because she has insomnia and usually wakes up at 2am and can't sleep afterwards. She's also a private tutor and while she's earning enough to sustain our family, I can tell she's very stressed about the family finances. My dad does most of the housework at home, though.

My biggest concern is how since both of my parents have been self-employed for very long, they have very very little money in their CPF, which means they have to work until retirement, if they can even retire. My brother has been working for years but he doesn't give my parents pocket money and they refuse to ask him because they feel such things should be given without having to ask, or it loses its meaning. I'm still in uni so I can't support them yet.

So I really want to persuade my dad to quit the canteen job and take up something else that has a little bit more stability and CPF contribution because I don't really think that being a canteen vendor is viable in the long term, especially since I can see him getting increasingly dejected and frustrated over the sales. Every day he comes home and complains about the school management not being fair to canteen vendors and how he hates the way they're being treated.

My question is: does anyone know of any schemes or pathways my dad can take to upgrade himself and get a better job that will pay him CPF? I know for sure there's SkillsFuture, but I'm also not exactly sure what courses to take. My dad is quite poor with technology, he can use the basic functions of the phone and search the internet and watch youtube, but beyond that he doesn't really know much. I also get the feeling that he doesn't want to be an employee and prefers his freedom, which I'm trying to respect but I'm also trying to find alternatives for him. His age is also a problem in that it might be difficult to upgrade and learn, and so are finances, because we're kind of tight at the moment.

If anyone has any stories or experiences that are similar I would really love to hear them. Of course, if my dad wants to stay in his current job I will not force him to change, but I'm hoping to gather some alternative paths that he can take and maybe convince him on the pros and cons. Please note that I'm in no way looking down on canteen vendors! They're very important and I know my dad enjoys interacting with students. But it's just that in recent years the prospects aren't looking very good and so I need to try and think of alternatives.

Thank you in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hkhyai/where_can_my_dad_go_from_here/,1.0,"['Canteen vendor in what kind of school?\n\nMy MIL is also a also a canteen vendor in a pri/sec combined campus school, she said it is good money.']"

7,singapore,205461,The Cosmo Dr Scam.,egr7x1,liamkohwil,1577542709,27,1,"Hi, Malaysian here! Woah, before you all shoot me, I'm here to discuss about this company/association/group? that's popped up in Malaysia over the past few months. I've tried doing some research about them, and I've noticed a handful of Singaporean based forums talking about them, and thought about asking you all about them too.

Here's my views following a bit of googling and having gone to their ""therapy sessions"" a few times: this is a scam operation that targets the clueless elderly. A family member (to my disappointment despite trying to give her information about the illegitimacy of electrotherapy/electrostatic therapy/whatever nonsense name they're giving it) bought one today.

Over the second half of 2019 they've been operating in Malaysia. They function by having pop-up show rooms around the state, with plenty of chairs with those electric mats on them connected to the central machine creating the electric frequency. I went to the one in Hartamas Shopping Mall a few times due to the persistence of my family, and how ""the show room will close if we don't meet the quota of participants boo hoo :("" according to the showpeople.

Those machines, they claim, ""massage the blood vessels"", somehow purifying the dirty blood in our body and curing many of the participants from a whole catch-all amount of diseases ranging from insomnia, joint pains..... and you guessed it, even CANCER. Yup, we're so advanced in 2019 that a vibrating electric pad is able to heal someone suffering from cancer, and Big Pharma is not promoting this method of treatment because if there're no sick people, we can't profit, right???? And certainly not because it doesn't work.

Throughout the 30 minutes of ""therapy"" session, there'll be a bunch of high energy and charming showmen filled to the brim with boomer jokes who'll be talking about various ""health topics"" such as how certain food contains crushed dried insects (this is called cochineal, google it), or how all diseases come from contaminated blood.

Here's the thing: all these topics they talk about are legit, and I've told my relatives countless times that I do not disagree with those topics. The issue though, comes down to the issue of how these topics are related to the effectiveness of the machine in curing diseases. And I've noticed the elderly participants somehow make that link because of this poem they love reciting to me:

""what they're saying is true,  
of course that means the machine works too!""

It's like saying that because my room's floor is flat, thus the earth must be flat as well. 

They only spend around 3 minutes talking about how the machine works (that too being very dubiously), with one slide showing a Microsoft office image of a vibrating circle which is supposed to be ""our blood vessels being massaged"", and then they whip out a picture of a whiteboard full of ""testimonies"" of all the diseases they've miraculously healed. Overweight? Why exercise when you can sit on a chair! Diabetes? Cool, say goodbye to your wheelchair and get an electric chair! LUNG CANCER? CONGRATS, OUR CHAIR HAS A DEGREE IN MIRACLE WORKING! Followed by various slides of doctors and their cool quotes, obviously taken out of context and not meant to validate this stupid chair.

If you do a simple Google search, and you'll discover that there is not only any scientific basis for the legitimacy of the therapy, but absolutely no one claiming that they've been healed from their ailments DIRECTLY BECAUSE of such therapy. Whatever ""scientific proof"" they churn out at you is either like mentioned above: quotes from highly regarded doctors not affirming their product, or stuff from a minority of medical professionals ONLY from Japan, and not from anyone outside of that country.

Lastly, their lies. Throughout the show room's running over the months, they've repeatedly emphasized how this was ""not a marketing or sales thing, but merely to LET EVERYONE ENJOY THE HEALTH BENEFITS."" What a wonderful gesture, if true! Promoting good health, genuinely and without profit in mind? And obviously if something is too good to be true, it usually is. Towards the end of the show room's operations, they started inserting subtle lines such as, ""we do sell these chairs if you'd like to buy"", followed by a hasty ""but at the end of the day, we do not obligate you to buy!"" Make your own conclusions, but as much as you can scream about how you're not selling something, such actions implicate your true intentions. The fact that they proudly announced last month that they've sold out all their chairs doesn't really help their case.

Another lie they told is how the cell phone affects the therapy effectiveness because of the ""radiation"". You should know by now how boomers absolutely gobble up the whole ""cell phone big bad, cause many cancer from radio waves despite no solid scientific evidence hurr durr!"" And today the delivery man dispelled that myth told to us for months, and simply said that they ban cell phones ""to make sure full attention is paid"". I think there's more, which is to prevent people from recording their scam.

If they can lie to you about such matters, what about the bigger issue at hand, which is the effectiveness of this machine?

Anyway. Please, don't let your older family members fall for this nonsense. It's basic knowledge that shaking your blood vessels doesn't do squat.

After a while, the noise stopped. I tried to sleep. 10 minutes later, heard a lot of stomping noise like they were playing catch or chasing one another. Heard them shout, ""Ahhhh CB you scared me! HAHAHAHA!"" More chit\-chatting.

Called police again, who confirmed they came down once already, but didn't see anyone. I told police the hooligans were back. They said they would come back.

It was around 4.30AM that the noise finally subsided.

10,singapore,134826,My (21/F) school counsellor (30s/F) molested me,9hygl3,badchab,1537608764,66,201,"This happened when I was in my first year of secondary school so I was 12 turning 13. I was having having my first psychosis episode (wasn’t diagnosed yet but I have bipolar). I had insomnia and was hearing voices. I was doing very badly in school, I couldn’t focus in class and was punished by my Teachers for not completing homework, resting my head on the table in class and daydreaming. One day, my teacher came up to me and asked me if anything was wrong. I told her I couldn’t sleep and that I was hearing voices. She then referred me to the school counsellor. 

The counsellor was a female with short curly hair. She was very nice and well liked by the students. Me and my Friends would hang out at her office and just talk to her during recess. So I felt like I could trust her. 

The first few sessions were fine until one day, I entered her room and she locked the door. She closed the blinds and turned off the lights. I was sitting on the sofa and she sat on the table really close to me, our knees touching. She kept saying “it’s going to be okay” and proceeded to rub up and down my thighs and under my skirt. 

I couldn’t move. At that age, I didn’t know what was happening. I thought all counsellors did that. She eventually stopped, and told me to leave and she locked the door behind her. The next day, I told my teacher that I tried to commit suicide and she told my counsellor. The counsellor sent me away to the mental hospital. The next 4 years I spent in the school, she would try and avoid me unable to look me in the eyes. 

It really fucked me up because the person who was supposed to help me, hurt me. 

I am now 21 and studying to be a counsellor. I want to be the person I needed when i was younger and to prove that she was a poor excuse of a counsellor. 

Recently, I was asked by my social worker if I wanted to make a police report. I said no, because it has been such a long time ago but I worry that she has been doing that to other kids.

Fell sick and got 5 day mc. Really used this time to think.

Anxiety and depression, two things I've come to live with most of my life.
Coming from a broken home, living in a rented room by myself since secondary school taught me how it was like to be alone.
Being beaten by a sadistic father, to the point that when my tuitor saw, she brought me to live with her for the months leading up to my psle so that I could actually study.
Locked up at home most of my childhood, beaten when I met any friends, there were times i was only given leftovers for my meals.
Coming to school, sad and broken, no one tried to understand me - i was just treated as an outlier, a statistical victim of domestic abuse.
I would love to share more, but make would make it easy for others to identify me.


You might not be able to tell, looking at me, but i can hardly hold a conversation. I'm constantly weak from not having any appetite, I feel constantly nauseous like there are a thousand butterflies in my stomach, my heart feels like it's being gripped by a hand, sometimes I get panic attacks and I just try to hide it. Being on the verge of a mental meltdown at any second. I cant sleep, insomnia is one of my only friends, at this point writing this, i havent slept for 26 hours.
Part of me wished i had a live round I could load into my sar21 so i can blow my brains all over the ceiling, or slitting my wrists with the Swiss army knife.
But part of me is wonders if will I ever be able to feel normal ? Will I ever have a normal life ?
An overzealous asian mother hasn't allowed me to see anyone, seek anyone or get any help - citing that it would destory my employment chances.

One of the blessings I must count is that I've met a wonderful MO and counsellor, talked to my OC and PC who shared with me the struggles they've gone through as well.
I wish i could be as strong as them. But I know someone as worthless as me is not entitled to that feeling. 100 million sperm and i'm the fucking idiot.

Hoping to find the time to get a referral letter and get some professional help.
And deep down I hope i'll be able to down pes, not only because im a ticking time bomb(almost toh during combat pt, havent really eaten days prior and didn't sleep at all the night before), but at least I'll be able to serve the nation to the best of my abilities.

I was a very slow learner, nearly got kicked out of sec sch cuz I keep failing everything,  never talked and when I did, I couldn't make friends because I had NO social skills. I had no friends, parents were too busy fighting each other to care about me, no support from teachers/counsellors and an abusive partner that I stayed because I needed some semblance of love. Online mmorpg games were my escape. I 100 agree with you that Sg's understanding of domestic abuse is very backwards, and it definitely still frustrates me. \n\n\nI eventually moved to a western country (people will know me if I share too much as well), got professional help, started healing from a supportive environment and I ended up identifying more with their open, laidback and caring culture that became part of my personality. Believe me, university was terrible because I realised how broken and ill functioning I was. One day, Instead of heading to the bridge to jump, I forced myself to visit my psychologist appt because despite the overwhelming sea of numbness a part of me definitely wanted to survive, just like you did. \n\nI learnt CBT and mindfulness. Your emotions are clouds in the sky that pass, and youre on the grass patch below watching them and asking yourself why you feel this way. You learn to detach yourself from your emotions. \n\nI signed on because I used my childhood experiences of being helpless as fuel to one day be a soldier who helps and defends the helpless. Although I am currently at odds with my entire section due to my initial inability to adapt to a different culture, having self doubt &amp; stressed and panic VERY easily, every day is a new day and I never stop trying to get better. Luckily some of my section mates are patient, although most have given up on me.\n\n My superiors think I am a wayang and I might as well be, although it's not the case since I am very critical in myself to hone my soldiering and technical skills, and my social skills are not exactly interpreted well by everyone.\n\nYou must get help. Don't care about what your mum says. At this point, take action. I applaud that YOU yourself chose to speak to your superiors, MO and counsellor about this, because deep down you want to get better. \n\nYou were dealt a terrible hand, but it doesn't define you and your worth. Use your past to refine your future, not define it. If you want to talk privately, I am open. Just want to let you know that there are people out there that care.\n\n Healing is not a straight line.

1,NationalServiceSG,2906,Any advice for my mental health?,gumrt5,deenutz98,1591025914,3,1,"Context:

Now in unit, Enlisted about 8 months ago. During my BMT I have reported to my PC regarding my mental health which ended up going through counselling. Its quite bad because back then during BMT at night I had to find a quiet space at my COY line to cry it out and cant help but be emotional. 

This left me no choice but to seek for counselling in camp. My BMT camp MO was an ass to me which “pushes” me deep down and making me feel more worthless about myself instead of helping me. Although he did ask if I would want to get referred to IMH for follow up, I said no. 

Though it generally got better over the months but I have the same thoughts coming back to me again. Although I don’t feel suicidal at all, I am having some kind of depression and anxiety which affects my mental health greatly. Yes, the counsellors back then did try to encourage me to think positive, but I couldn’t help myself after sometime. Not only that, I am having insomnia for quite some time now. 

I am thinking if I should report to the MO regarding this, and get referred to IMH for diagnosis but I would want to know generally how the process is like. I am currently thinking of protecting my mental health over my 2 years in NS. 

And there are lots of sayings that going to IMH leaves you a record under your name, but in what way? Does my resume have to state that I have went through IMH during my NS? Or my NS testimonial will state that I have went through IMH? 

I am looking to request to have excuse stay-in (although my unit is a stay-out unit - less duty) and excuse firearms due to my mental health and anxiety problem. 

Anyone that went through this before, mind dropping me a message, please?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/gumrt5/any_advice_for_my_mental_health/,1.0,"['hi i went through the same thing as you but in unit. i have since down pessed already and gotten the excuses you mentioned + more. if this is really affecting you i strongly suggest you go seek help. if you are worried about the IMH record, firstly, the records can only be accessed by the government which will only slightly affect you if you decide to get a job in the public sector. secondly, law states that employers are not allowed to ask potential employees about their mental health history and if they do find out, are not allowed to not hire them based solely on the mental health issue. another option if you do not want any record whatsoever in IMH is to go to a private psychiatrist (what i did). the misconception that a private doctor’s memo would not work is completely false.']"

I also feel extremely fatigued and unmotivated in the day and have no appetite during meal times. I didn’t sound off this issue earlier as i didn’t want to appear as a chao keng but now i really feel the shittiest i have in my entire life and i feel that my mental health is really deteriorating. is there anyway i can make my life better and can i have some advice on whether or not and how i should report this (currently haven’t done so) because i feel like i really cannot take this shit anymore.,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/fk4m9d/depressed_in_infantry/,0.0,"['see MO.

But i am lost on what to do,ke6lqk,ue201919,1608113359,4,1,"I enlisted in August and i recently pop-ed in the 04/20 batch and since ptp i have been having insomnia as well as anxiety. I am always getting stressed whenever i am in camp or during book-in time. I was hoping if i complete bmt and go to unit, my problems would get better but it hasn't. I know it has only been 3 days since i got posted to my unit but i feel my insomnia and anxiety is getting worse by the day and so i decided to seek help. I talked to my PC about it and he told me he to give him a reason as to why i have insomnia before arranging me to see a doctor. I have been holding it in for the better part of 3 months as i was afraid to get help. And when i decided to get help, i got told to give the reason as to why i am feeling this before i can get help as mentioned earlier. I feel going to a polyclinic to get an appointment to a general hospital would take a really long time and my parents are super against me going to imh at all. So i am lost as to where i can go to get help. My worry now is that anywhere i go, the waiting time would be really long and my conditions might just get worse. I think i am having adjustment disorder as i feel it hard to adapt to the military life but i am no doctor and hence i wanted to get it check. As mentioned earlier i am afraid that waiting to get help might make health worse.

I am sorry if this is really messy and complicated.

Say that your anxiety keeps you from relaxing and so it\'s hard to fall asleep or something, and that insomnia seriously affects your work and mood. \n\nGo to a polyclinic and at least get a few days of MC to rest. Your 11B should cover doctor consultation costs. Don\'t care about being called out for trying to chao keng or anything, your mental health matters more than what others think/call you.\n\nIf you can\'t take it, at polyclinic, ask the doctor to send you to IMH A&amp;E. It is 24-hours and there will be nurses to assist you. No appointment needed if urgent help is required.\n\nExplain what you are going through (ie. anxiety, insomnia), and the reasons why (eg. cannot get adjusted to camp environment, superiors are too strict, duties too shag etc.), how it affects you (eg. low mood, feel suicidal, can\'t focus, low appetite). They will give you longer term MC, medication, doctor memo etc. that you can show your supervisor so they can ""understand"".\n\nIf, even after talking to all your superiors, no one can help, call the SAF counselling hotline (1800-278-0022).\n\nDo not let your parents stop you from going to IMH if you really need help.

4,NationalServiceSG,5851,How is my employability as a Pes F,k8eeld,StrugglingNsf,1607337910,10,1,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. For main question, scroll down. Sorry for the semi-lengthy long post ahead.

**Some Background:** I've been struggling with mental health issues for the past 4 years now. Enlisted over a year ago, tried my best in BMT, anxiety and insomnia just got worse, ended up OOC-ing. Was posted to an admin unit, pretty slack and things were okay for a while with no obvious stressors but relapse after relapse and the exponential worsening of my condition landed me in PCC after multiple visits to IMH and various A&amp;Es. 

My initial visit to PCC, the MO had asked if I wanted to opt out of NS but I said I wanted to try to continue, I really did at the time since I almost hit my one year mark then, but after going through some rehab and it really doing nothing for me, my condition got even worse and the PCC MO suggested Pes F again, which is still iffy for me but I am more inclined to taking up his offer now as I really no longer think I can continue. I was put on mc and just given some time to think it over and discuss it with my family. 

**My question here is this,** the MO obviously warned about the ""severe"" implications such as potential employability, housing issues (as a consequence of being unemployable and not due to the myth of being a second class citizen) and insurance. Having spoken to multiple people, I would say the latter 2 don't really affect me as much as I would say I'm fortunate enough to have secure housing in my future and my psychiatrist at IMH did assure me that my condition is temporary so insurance would just be delayed by a couple years at max. So I'm really just concerned about the employability. I work in the creative field and I do plan on furthering my studies regardless of my choice to down pes or not. I don't really intend on working in the public sector as it doesn't really align with my goals in life but the MO warned me about some employers requiring an ORD certificate which is why I'm kind of here for advice. Information about this is kind of scarce with just many outdated urban myths floating about and a ton of conflicting information from the different experiences of different people, so I'm just looking for a more 2020 view on this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/k8eeld/how_is_my_employability_as_a_pes_f/,0.99,['When are you going to ORD?']

0,NTU,2884,hall or commute to sch?,gkptfu,IBsurvivor2019,1589609565,25,1,"if I were to stay in hall, I’m able to opt for single w aircon but can I also opt for single w aircon&amp;attached bathroom(?) for incoming freshmen. 
Any seniors will be able to share why they chose to stay in hall or commute to sch istd? 
A lil of background :
I grew up rly privileged meaning I was sent to sch daily(except 2-3 times I took the bus) in my 6 years of sec-Jc. Even then it was rly near by bus and so if I was tired I’d take the taxi back after school. 
Now, NTU is in the opp direction front my parents workplace &amp; NUS(my sis goes there). so by car it’s 20 mins but that means 40 for my dad to send me up &amp; go back. &amp; to take the bus requires 1h 47 Mins. I’m serious when I said I’ve only taken the bus 2-3 times in the morning in my entire education from pri-JC &amp; they were 15 mins bus ride max. 
Someone told me to just try for one semester (I plan on getting my license as well...)
But what I’d like to know for those who are staying in single room with or without attached bathroom
1. How difficult was it to adapt to the environment/ learning to do your own laundry/cleaning etc
I have had helpers since I was born so I never did my own laundry/cooking only thing I did was clean the floor of my room when my helper went back for her annual leave we sent our clothes out &amp; ate out.
2. Do you feel claustrophobic? 
- I saw the room tours on YouTube and my room is twice to thrice the size of the room &amp; why I won’t opt for double room is because I have insomnia/ gets woken up easily etc.
If any seniors who were in my situation before, could you enlighten me on which is better? Staying in hall or commuting
when I have a driving license, would it be inconvenient to drive to &amp; fro daily as compared to staying in the hall?",https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/gkptfu/hall_or_commute_to_sch/,1.0,"[""Hello. Well for me what I did was to stay at hall on the weekdays and come home on the weekends. This is because I live in Yishun, but at the same I like eating home cooked food and my mom was fine with doing my laundry at home every weekend.  \n\nIn March there were one/two weeks where I commuted from home (bcos I didn't want to be around campus too much/social distancing) pretty much most of the days. (My dad would drop me and pick me up, takes 20-30 min each way).\n\nWhat I felt about that was how much petrol was getting used just going to and fro every day. So if that's not a concern for you it might be okay to drive there every day. But another problem with driving is that (if I happen to drive the car) it can be stressful especially in the trafficy times (i mean peak hours). If you don't feel stressful about it its an ok idea bcos you won't take long to travel to NTU. \n\nIf you were to take the bus/MRT, well you'll get used to it eventually so don't worry about familiarity. I'm actually fine with taking public transport if not for the long time it takes. (Tip: try to use MRT for the bulk of your trip, its faster) If you are able to be productive and do some readings/work while commuting it may not be a bad idea but if you feel you need the extra time just stay in hall. (anyway you could also just try hall for a sem and see how it goes, it seems like you can afford to do that.)\n\nAbout feeling claustrophobic, well I don't have that issue because I was fine with studying in my room itself. but it depends on the person.""]"
