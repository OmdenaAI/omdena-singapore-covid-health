4,SGExams,26487,[O levels] 220 in PSLE to 7 nett L1R5,es9v70,Buboo132,1579687119,96,1,"This is not a success story or a way for me to brag about my results and what not. Instead I just want to share/‘inspire’with those taking their Os in years to come that no matter where you are at now(academically,mentally etc), you can still aim for the stars.
After receiving my psle result, I was extremely disheartened. I could not enter any of the school I initially wanted. I felt like a failure. I felt like I disappointed my parents. My mother placed me in a neighbourhood school ,that I had no interest in, as it was affiliated to a JC, in case I mess up my Os like how I messed up my psle. 
(Won’t share much about lower sec as it was really mundane and nothing really important) 
Sec3 started and the work load was intense.I managed to enter the triple sci class, taking amths and ss/geog. Also I’m an Indian who takes Chinese as my mother tongue. Have some Chinese blood in my veins but no one in my family can speak Chinese. By mid year I had an L1R5 of 19. I couldn’t understand and didn’t do well in amths, physics, chem, geog,bio.  The only subjects I was good at were SS and Chinese( my sch gave the answers to exams in hopes that more people will pass their Chinese ). I then decided it was for the greater good if I dropped a subject. I genuinely enjoyed studying bio. Amths is necessary for H2 maths. No one can drop chem or geog. So I dropped physics. Was a tough decision, as I was the only one in my class to do so(at that time）and people mocked me. But I also never understood what the teacher was teaching and though I scored a B3 for it in mid years it was really cause I had done the P1 before and I merely regurgitated the answers.
I then proceeded to find myself a tutor. After countless trials and errors, I finally found the right one. He teaches all three sciences and double maths. If u want his contact ( only does tuition at his home in Sembawang now ) just message me directly. IM NOT PROMOTING YEAH I JUST WANNA SHARE. He was really patient and helpful. He really made an impact nearing Os. But my EOYs I was still struggling with most of my subjects like Bio, Maths, Amths( worst subject haha ) and geog. English was a constant B4 and Chinese... well lets not talk about it yet as I said, we were all kinda cheating. 
Over the December  holidays I decided that I’m going to start working harder. also note during sec 3 I was really emotionally unstable. I was facing so much pressure from CCA, toxic friendships and even more toxic ppl who just wanted to make me hate myself. I put an end to several friendships and started distancing myself from friends who really didn’t see the importance of Os as much as I did. Amths was really painful haha. I spent so many hours just trying to solve questions. Trust me, if I can do it, so can you. I know it ain’t easy. BUT DONT REFER TO THE SOLUTION WITHOUT TRYING. It’s hard. But I had to persevere and wreck my brain to find the solutions. It may take hours. But once you manage to solve the question, the sense of satisfaction is the only reward you’ll need. And you’ll never need to refer the solutions again. 
Once all the leadership stuff and CCA ended, I had more time to invest in my studies. Every morning I would wake up extra early to do extra work on my weaker concepts and chapters. I started doing my homework on my own and not by copying others. Fortunately others in my class were doing the same thing as I was, and though we never really chatted before, we started studying together and soon a clique was formed. 
MT Os were held in June unlike other subjects. So my school stopped other lessons and we had MT intensive from 8 to 5 for 2 weeks.  This is when you go all out man. My brain hurt from all the Chinese I was immersing myself into. Mind you it really wasn’t easy for someone like me. But I pressed on. All the Chinese phrases I memorise. All the TYS papers I did( I completed the entire TYS so that’s 20 Olvl papers to prep u for ). I constantly seek my Chinese teacher for consults ( even when he was sick lol ). And every weekend when my tutor came to my place I would give her work to do haha. I would do Paper 1s and 2s for her to mark on top of my school work. Don’t waste time on games anymore, or social events and what not. If u need a break, legit just go for a walk,it really helps. Oral was even more hard for me as Ive mentioned a million times by now, I’m not Chinese. But seek consults guys, your Teachers are willing to help. If not, ask the other Chinese Teachers if you feel that yours isn’t available or useful. It all paid off as I got A2 for Chinese and didn’t choose to resit. 
So until November, don’t waste time. See the respective Teachers for help, use every pocket of time you get to revise concepts, or do questions. It will be tiring and you will feel like giving up, but just remember, it will all be over soon. The day you get that darn Olevel cert will be the greatest reward of all time. Find yourself a group of friends who have the same goals as you, and it doesn’t have to be the same destination. 
So a few weeks ago I got back my results. 7 distinctions, 3 A1s ( Amths, Maths and Bio) and 4A2s ( EL, Chi, CH and Chem) . I wont lie at first I was slightly disappointed. Wanted A1s for Chem and CH. I messed up chem practical and I am extremely bad at physical geog.  But then I realised that not many can get such a score and it was the fruit of my labour, so I should be contended. My tutor had a huge help in my double sciences and double maths. My school Chinese teacher and my tutor for my Chinese. A teacher who didn’t even teach my class helped me out with my English. An amazing ss teacher, 2 terrific maths Teachers and 2 special geog Teachers. Don’t forget to thank those who have helped you on your education pathway. If not for them, I wouldn’t have done so well. Now I’m just praying everyday that I can enter my dream school though it is a bit risky [COP also 7 points].

That was okay for me, I got what I deserved. 

But JAE put me into a school even worse than what I deserved. I didn’t get into any of the JCs that should have. Even my appeals were turned down, despite meeting the cut off points. (but that’s because I’m a PR I think)

I felt like such an idiot, for all of orientation I didn’t make any friends thinking they were all beneath me and decided to focus on bettering myself so I don’t have to go through this again. I am in the top 1% of this school and I didn’t need to go around promoting myself to make friends, I knew I could choose the best of them. 

Then came CCA, I made a mistake putting basketball as my second choice instead of first even though that was what I really wanted. And now I’m stuck in a CCA that I don’t mind but I would really prefer not to be in. 

The people in my current CCA are toxic beyond belief and I really wanted to appeal out of it, but the teachers aren’t letting me.

14,SGExams,29467,[O levels] [A levels] [Uni] Wanted to share my life story and listen to some opinions. I feel that I might be quite extremist.

Ok so I was replying to this thread above ^. And I wanted to seek some opinion on a small part of my view on life and how to go about it. Is it too extreme? Cuz I don't feel so..... But wanna hear some opinions.

The reply : 

Like the saying goes, hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. So the part in the above comment that said "" hard work &gt; talent"" is only appliable to a mutually exclusive situation. Either hard work or talent, ofc hard work will win if the other talented guy just sleeps all day thinking he can tank it with his talent. 

But what if... The talented person also works hard? But still not as much as you do? He works hard like 70/100 on the scale scale but compared to him, you're 500/100 on the scale. 

So what CAN you do? Work smart too. That's the missing part. It's not just hard work vs talent, it's a triple variable comparison of hard work, smart work and talent.  

I've come to realize this in life, that it is unfair. So what CAN you do? Since life is so unfair, why take the shorter end of the stick when u can take the longer end? (I'm not saying this in a toxic way where u gotta sabotage someone to get the longer end of the stick, but instead this idea should be applied to a non-personal competition situation eg like studies or like idk jobs or interviews, whereby u have countless competitors and whereby u don't have to sabo other people to become a winner, but u just have to ethically change the situation you are in so as to win. 

Don't hate the player, hate the game.
If u can't beat them, join them (applied to the correct context! Eg studying smart and not just working hard only) 

For interviews, u gotta know what makes the interviewers tick, what they want, and just GIVE IT TO THEM (don't lie, but be on a lookout for what they want so that u can know what part of your life/experiences to tell them) , while also not forgetting to present the truth in such a succinct, professional and somewhat manipulative way it almost feels unethical and immoral with a sense of guilt, because you are so good at it it's like mind reading and cheating. That's what I call taking the long end of the stick without sabotaging anyone, but instead being smart about your opponent and POSITIONING yourself well in the game (the game being the job interview or wtv. If it FEELS unethical and manipulative but still fully legal, moral cuz of non sabotage, and theoretically correct, then u know that's the thing u gotta do)


This skill is so much more important than you think, many people think it's unethical. But it fully isn't and even the ""victim"" eg the interviewer for a job, would be so willing to let you ""commit the crime"" eg giving them what they want and somewhat mentally seducing them, so much so that they can't wait to give you the job. 

Everyday, I am practising this skill , because it is such a treasure to possess it, I swear. U can read up more by reading books like "" how to get what you want"" on Google, they should have a similar mindset. It's called street smarts. I wasn't born with it, but OP bro u gotta learn. 



Tldr : street smarts, know your game, correct positioning, taking the longer end of the stick.

I came from a low tier school with very little competition and I am envious of the toxic and cunning culture of deceit, backstabbing and closet mugging i hear from the elite institutions. So I am putting out this openly available resources for everyone to know. Remember, now that this information is out, your competition will be getting an advantage over you so instead of lazing by in army, why not start studying harder and advance science for the better.

17,SGExams,29042,[UNI] ALL ABOUT NUS LAW 1.0! (+ AMA),f97rur,Oceanmaze1996,1582622947,100,1,"Hello! I’m a current NUS Law year 3 student. This post is inspired by the other similar posts about other NUS faculties which are extremely well-written so I hope this will meet the lofty standards set by the other faculties =). This post seeks to provide **general information for those considering about NUS Law or a career in law since the other schools (SMU and SUSS have higher similar law curriculum) as well as to clarify some doubts about a legal education in our local universities**.  I understand that unfortunately there is no physical open house this year and frankly I am unsure about the school's plan for outreach because the information doesn't seem to be available via the school portal. Nonetheless, I will be happy to engage in discussions on this thread or via a pm and I will do my best to answer to your queries promptly. To my fellow law school pals in this thread, would be happy to invite you to share your perspective with prospective freshmen as well =) Thank you in advance for chiming in.

\*\*Disclaimer: the tips that I give are entirely based on my own perception so please don't take it as gospel. But these are information that I have shared to my current juniors before they entered law school and they mentioned that they found it useful so hope this helps!

Just some background context about myself: I came from the A-level route, have been past the internships galore in law and thankfully, have secured my training contract in 1 of the big 4 firms. A training contract is like the doctor's equivalent of houseman or a trainee in some other courses and a stepping stone to a full-time job.

[GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT NUS Law admissions and degree](https://law.nus.edu.sg/admissions/4_yrs_llb_prog.html)

**Official website:**[NUS Law OFFICIAL WEBSITE](https://law.nus.edu.sg/index.html)

\---

**1 Curriculum**

*The general curriculum* (latest caa the current academic year) can be found [here](http://www.law.nus.edu.sg/student_matters/llb_prog/pdfs/typ_sch_llb_1920_after.pdf)

Generally, the first 2 years are dedicated to core modules that will serve as the foundational subjects. This means that most modules are pre-allocated and there is little choice besides the option of trial advocacy or corporate deals in semester 2 of year 2. These core modules are very important as the skills and knowledge taught  will be very useful for any subjects or legal endeavours that you will pursue in the future. For instance, the Legal Analysis, Research and Communications module taken in year 1 imparts the core skills that you require to write a proper legal memorandum and argue your case in court in the future. To top it off, the final moot assessment is akin to a mock trial where you will argue your case in court. Other modules like contract law and company law are very prevalent issues that will arise in the modern commercial world that we live in today.

In year 3 and year 4, you get to select modules with the exception of a compulsory module called Evidence Law. This is when you get to select from a wide array of law based on your interests: like shipping law, construction law or public international law just to name a few.

Also, just to clarify, law follows the NUS study semesters to a tee, unlike medicine and dentistry so rest assured that you will be having breaks, reading weeks and exams the same time as the rest of your NUS peers

*Weekly schedule of lessons:*

For year 1, you will generally be taking 4 modules (Criminal law, tort law, contract law and LARC) that will last for an entire year while you will be taking another 2 modules each in 1 semester (Singapore Law in Context and Introduction to Legal Theory). You will generally expect to have 15 hours of lesson weekly, which might seem heavenly compared to the 6-8 contact hours daily in Junior College.

However, welcome to university: you will need to prepare for class especially tutorials or you risk getting lost in class. The preparation time for each class will be entirely up to you. Generally speaking, it is realistic to spend up to 10 hours for each of the year-long subjects because there are just so many cases and academic material to digest. But rest assured, there is a wealth of material (affectionately known as muggers) and study guides painstakingly prepared and refined by generations of seniors that regularly gets passed on from batch to batch. So do continue to pay it forward and continued the tradition when you're a freshman =)

*Lesson format + Lecturers/Tutors*

The lessons will be either in the form of seminar, tutorials or a cohort based lecture. About 50% of your lessons will be tutorials (10-12 per class to 1 tutor) or seminars (50 per class to 1 tutor), with the other 50% being a cohort based lecture. Lectures and tutorials are usually 2 hours long while seminars are 3 hours long and there is usually a short break in between.

Lecturers and tutors are prominent academics or professionals with a wealth of experience from the legal industry. Most of them are very well-respected in the profession and are regularly cited in court decisions. From personal experience, a large majority of them can teach very well and are very receptive to feedback, so feel free to let them know if you have any difficulties about the class.

Oh and I haven't mentioned, certain classes will be taught by lawyers that are still practising and have day jobs so some classes will be held at night as a result.

Materials will be entirely provided for by the course convenor (reading lists). The general databases like Lawnet comes with your student status and the law library is well stocked with every possible legal material you need.

*Internship*

In NUS Law, internships are entirely based on your own onus. SMU Law has a compulsory 10 week internship graduation requirement. Do note that for either school, internships are SELF SOURCED. So you will need to visit each of the firms' websites, find out about what they specialise in and whether it aligns with your career aspirations. However, rest assured that the school provides regular updates via email blast on internship opportunities and have a dedicated career guidance team to provide guidance whenever you require. What's more, you can always rely on the trusty source of advice - word of mouth and your seniors.

Generally, students will do internships during their respective breaks in the summer or winter breaks. Most internships last 3-4 weeks. Students generally do an average of 2-3 internships in total before they start applying for training contracts from year 3, just so that they get a good exposure to the legal profession. The experience for each law firm varies but from personal experience, there is a fair bit that a legal intern can do and an internship will definitely be a valuable experience since your legal knowledge will no doubt give you the ability to complete useful legal work.

*Training contract application*

This will happen from year 3 onwards as students are usually able to apply once they obtain their year 2 semester 2 results.

Similar to internships, this is entirely up to you to apply to the respective firms by the respective deadlines and the available avenues for information will always be there for you. Furthermore, the school organises a yearly career fair for law firms to come down and share with the students. Training contracts are usually be awarded based on internship evaluation as well as interview.

This is the point where I want to debunk the myth of the glut of training contracts, the glut is easing definitely and a large percentage of my current batch (year 3) have already secured their training contracts. Moreover, there are still a good number of training contracts out there available for students and most that do not have a contract is because they do not find a good fit out there or entirely based on choice (i.e not entering practice). The ""say real"" opinion is that local graduates, regardless of academic results, will largely be able to find a training contract so long as they want to =) The glut that the news reported are more of a factor for ""Relevant Legal Training"", which is a requirement for overseas graduates and not local graduates. So rest assured if the paucity of training contracts is weighing on your decision to enter NUS Law.

**2. NUS Law student life opportunities**

*Unrestricted Electives*

You are allowed to take a maximum of 3 unrestricted elective modules outside of the faculty for the duration that you are in NUS. That means that you can take almost any module of your liking, like French, Astronomy, Forensic Science, Drama, Philosophy, etc. This allows us to explore our interests outside the law curriculum and a good chance to meet people from other faculties. However, you can only do so in year 3 and year 4

*Student life in Law*

The student life in law is vibrant. There are many sub clubs like the pro-bono club which is like the service learning club in JC), NUS Law club which is like JC's equivalent of student council, Criminal Justice Club which does programmes about criminal justice in Singapore etc. There is also sports interests groups where students prepare for sports meets like the Inter-Faculty Games in NUS, Law-Fraternity games with the legal profession and lastly the Law-Medicine Games. In addition, pop-up groups like Dance and Arts have recently popped up, thanks to the outstanding push of initiatives by the current law club. You are not required to join any clubs and everything is up to your choice.

*Balancing other interests and passion in school*

There is also the misconception that since the law faculty is stuck in Bukit Timah Campus away from the main Kent Ridge Campus, most students just stay in law school and you will be stuck with a social circle of just law students. This is untrue. There are many students who live on Kent Ridge Campus as the BTC bus that connects the two campuses are very convenient and follow a strict time table so it provides a reliable mode of transport. Besides, travelling between the two locations only take up to 20-25 minutes on a good day so it is really not that far away. A good number also have Kent Ridge CCAs like dance or sports and are still able to reasonably balance with the academic endeavours.

Personally, I did join an NUS-wide dance group in year 3. It was an amazing experience performing and improving my skills, 10/10 would recommend. Most of my friends have other commitments out of school like being a leader in Church, joining external groups so it's really not all work and no play in law school.

*Exchange Programmes*

NUS Law partners with a wide range of universities and students generally go in either semester 1 or 2 in year 3. There are a few year-long exchanges but it would require some juggling of modules to meet the graduation requirement. More information can be found [here](https://law.nus.edu.sg/student_matters/student_ex.html)

However, do note that students generally apply in year 2 for exchange and exchange is not compulsory. The awarding of places is entirely based on grades and based on the demand of your batchmates, so if you want to go to your desired exchange places be prepared to work for it.

&amp;#x200B;

**3 Admission Information**

*Indicative Grade Profiles A Levels 2019*

10th percentile: AAA/A

90th percentile: AAA/A

Note on A-levels: generally 87.5 RP should grant you at least the interview and written test, after that it is entirely based on your performance there. Having a slightly lower RP will mean that you likely have to rely on DA.

*Polytechnic GPA 2019*

10th percentile: 3.86/4.0

90th percentile: 3.93/4.0

*Admission requirements:*

There is a ***compulsory*** written test and interview which will be held in April. Interviews will be held 17-18 Apr 2020 while the written test is on 19 Apr 2020

*Tips for Admission Interviews*

a) Written statement

There is a written one page statement to be brought in to the interview on why do you wish to join NUS Law and from my personal experience, my interviewer refer to it to probe questions on why I want to join NUS Law.

Think through why you want to come to NUS Law and make it as personalised as possible. Like what you hear about the school, read the website, what interests you etc.

So write your statement well like any normal essay and always have a good structure for your paragraphs: Point - Elaboration/Examples - Explanation - Link back to your point. Make sure your first sentence runs with your last sentence of each paragraph.  Also, you should make your language clear so that the point comes through most effectively. Try to be as direct as possible because the interviewer or the assessor will in some way refer to it somehow. What I mean by direct is for example you are interested in community service, there is a law equivalent called pro bono and you can say like you want to learn legal knowledge and how to apply them to practical problems. At the same time, show your passion for community service via past examples like meet the people sessions etc. Be very familiar with the personal statement so that you can elaborate on them during the interview and the interviewer can refer to it and know that you have prepared thoroughly, thinking through why you want to come to NUS law.

b) Interview

2 interviewers to you in a room, I think it was a 10-15 minutes interview unless the format has changed.

Be yourself as much as possible, same thing as above, be very clear and to the point. Don’t beat around the bush. I find it best to always use Point-Elaboration/Examples - Evaluation. Answer the question immediately in your first statement and it will help if you signpost. For example, they will more likely or not ask you why you want to come to NUS Law. Say immediately like I want to come for 2 main reasons - student life and pro bono activities. Then explain with examples so that it is more personalised and then at the end conclude and bring back to the main point of the question why you want to come to NUS Law.

Also, you need to know at least what interests you in law and not give a generalised one. Think through carefully again and make it very personal will be best. For instance, you can know which area of law you are interested in and why: eg. I am interested in Family Law because I witnessed first hand during an internship with Legal Aid Bureau that Singapore's legal regulation of family law very optimal for the child's welfare.

Last of all, treat it like a conversation. Make it natural and flow because part of being a lawyer requires you to present your case and persuade!

*Scholarships*

All the general scholarships like stat board scholarships, PSC, SAF apply to law. Also, there are a few faculty scholarships for outstanding students. The application details can be found on the general NUS website on scholarships, which is [here](http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/scholarships)

&amp;#x200B;

**4 The legal profession**

*Concerns about the job*

I will not profess to know much about the legal profession because I am not in the profession yet. But one of the biggest gripes is work-life balance and the insanely long working hours. My simple response to them is - which other profession do not require the pre-requisite of hard work? Take for instance: some of my programming friends work very long hours coding and most at start-ups stay in office, for doctors/accountants don't even get me started lol. What's more, we can observe a clear increase in emphasis when looking at work-life balance in many law firms today. Many allow for flexible working hours etc and generally the people I spoke to during internships seem to say that it is manageable. Furthermore, the very nature of the legal profession where high standards and having to do due diligence when churning out work really requires the preparation (as you will get a taste of in law school just how sensitive some legal issues are). So it is best we view it as work-life integration. If so many seniors have been able to do it, so can I =)

*Salary*

Law is actually one of the highest paid degrees in the market and this is well-documented. Do note that the salary is only AFTER you have secured retention, which means after training contract.

More information can be found [here](https://blog.seedly.sg/graduate-starting-salary-nus-ntu-smu-sutd-sit/).

*Career progression*

If you stay in practice, the progression is generally from associate to senior associate to partner etc.

The law degree is also very versatile, a large number of lawyers become legal counsels in various other companies or work in statutory boards.

&amp;#x200B;

**5 Other FAQs not addressed**

*Local or Overseas legal education, which is better?*

This would entirely up to your perception on what you deem as better. While it may be less stressful overseas, you must also consider several drawbacks, like the costs, the breadth of the teaching there and having to pick up local knowledge if you want to practice locally. Having had 2.5 years of legal education in Singapore, I would say that there is a fair bit different in the local positions compared to overseas and you must note that most overseas in UK/Australia do not touch Singapore cases at all. The overseas students I met during internship did mention that it is a struggle to pick up legal knowledge on the job during internships so I would take that into consideration if I were in your position. For instance, the duty of care position (a common tort issue) is VERY different in Australia and UK. Also, take note of the Part A passing rates =)! Local students don't have to do part A.

Lastly, there is exchange opportunities if you want to experience an overseas education and the semester there will be grade free =) I rest my case.

*Is law school environment hostile and toxic?*

My answer to this is a resounding no. Like with any other place, there is bound to be politics involved and it is all about perception! As the common saying goes ""Do not do unto others what you do not want others to do unto you"". Besides the law population is so small, being a douchebag will definitely not get you very far and your reputation will definitely be in tatters.

The law school population is generally very very friendly. Seniors are very generous in passing on their notes and sharing any knowledge with juniors. There are regular collaborations among batches to pass on to the juniors eg. there was a very nicely compiled freshman guide this year and the y2(current y3) batch also compiled their internship experiences for the juniors.

My batchmates are mostly friendly as well and we do build great relationship here. My circle of friends share internship experiences, notes and any tips freely. So rest assured =)

*What should I do before law school? Do I need to prepare?*

No, please do not, the effort to reward ratio is far too low because you can definitely be able to pick up studying again when you are back at school. If you really insist, you can do a legal internship and have a glimpse of the legal industry. However, the value you can provide is limited because you have not been through any sort of legal education unfortunately.

Go enjoy, do what you want and love. I personally went for the MOE Teaching internship and loved every aspect of it teaching kids, it inspired me to join volunteer work teaching children which I do till this very day.

Last of all, look out for the orientation activities painstakingly planned by the orientation committee. There is law camp, RAG, matriculation and pro bono among many other activities. PLEASE JOIN THEM BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST WAY TO MAKE FRIENDS FROM DAY 1 in law school trust me on this. More information can be found here on their [Instagram](https://www.google.com/search?q=nus+law+orientation&amp;oq=nus+law+orientation+&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2j69i64l2.4983j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/NUSLawOrientation/) or their official [website](https://nuslaworientation.com/matriculation-week). All these are to be updated and the first activity is usually the welcome tea in May followed by law camp in June.

There is a ***compulsory*** written test and interview which will be held in April. Interviews will be held 17-18 Apr 2020 while the written test is on 19 Apr 2020

*Tips for Admission Interviews*

a) Written statement

There is a written one page statement to be brought in to the interview on why do you wish to join NUS Law and from my personal experience, my interviewer refer to it to probe questions on why I want to join NUS Law. 

Think through why you want to come to NUS Law and make it as personalised as possible. Like what you hear about the school, read the website, what interests you etc. 

So write your statement well like any normal essay and always have a good structure for your paragraphs: Point - Elaboration/Examples - Explanation - Link back to your point. Make sure your first sentence runs with your last sentence of each paragraph.  Also, you should make your language clear so that the point comes through most effectively. Try to be as direct as possible because the interviewer or the assessor will in some way refer to it somehow. What I mean by direct is for example you are interested in community service, there is a law equivalent called pro bono and you can say like you want to learn legal knowledge and how to apply them to practical problems. At the same time, show your passion for community service via past examples like meet the people sessions etc. Be very familiar with the personal statement so that you can elaborate on them during the interview and the interviewer can refer to it and know that you have prepared thoroughly, thinking through why you want to come to NUS law.

b) Interview

2 interviewers to you in a room, I think it was a 10-15 minutes interview unless the format has changed.

Be yourself as much as possible, same thing as above, be very clear and to the point. Don’t beat around the bush. I find it best to always use Point-Elaboration/Examples - Evaluation. Answer the question immediately in your first statement and it will help if you signpost. For example, they will more likely or not ask you why you want to come to NUS Law. Say immediately like I want to come for 2 main reasons - student life and pro bono activities. Then explain with examples so that it is more personalised and then at the end conclude and bring back to the main point of the question why you want to come to NUS Law. 

Also, you need to know at least what interests you in law and not give a generalised one. Think through carefully again and make it very personal will be best. For instance, you can know which area of law you are interested in and why: eg. I am interested in Family Law because I witnessed first hand during an internship with Legal Aid Bureau that Singapore's legal regulation of family law very optimal for the child's welfare. 

Last of all, treat it like a conversation. Make it natural and flow because part of being a lawyer requires you to present your case and persuade!

*Scholarships*

All the general scholarships like stat board scholarships, PSC, SAF apply to law. Also, there are a few faculty scholarships for outstanding students. The application details can be found on the general NUS website on scholarships, which is [here](http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/scholarships)

**4 The legal profession**

*Concerns about the job*

I will not profess to know much about the legal profession because I am not in the profession yet. But one of the biggest gripes is work-life balance and the insanely long working hours. My simple response to them is - which other profession do not require the pre-requisite of hard work? Take for instance: some of my programming friends work very long hours coding and most at start-ups stay in office, for doctors/accountants don't even get me started lol. What's more, we can observe a clear increase in emphasis when looking at work-life balance in many law firms today. Many allow for flexible working hours etc and generally the people I spoke to during internships seem to say that it is manageable. Furthermore, the very nature of the legal profession where high standards and having to do due diligence when churning out work really requires the preparation (as you will get a taste of in law school just how sensitive some legal issues are). So it is best we view it as work-life integration. If so many seniors have been able to do it, so can I =)

*Salary*

Law is actually one of the highest paid degrees in the market and this is well-documented. Do note that the salary is only AFTER you have secured retention, which means after training contract.

More information can be found [here](https://blog.seedly.sg/graduate-starting-salary-nus-ntu-smu-sutd-sit/). 

*Career progression*

If you stay in practice, the progression is generally from associate to senior associate to partner etc.

The law degree is also very versatile, a large number of lawyers become legal counsels in various other companies or work in statutory boards.

&amp;#x200B;

**5 Other FAQs not addressed**

*Local or Overseas legal education, which is better?*

This would entirely up to your perception on what you deem as better. While it may be less stressful overseas, you must also consider several drawbacks, like the costs, the breadth of the teaching there and having to pick up local knowledge if you want to practice locally. Having had 2.5 years of legal education in Singapore, I would say that there is a fair bit different in the local positions compared to overseas and you must note that most overseas in UK/Australia do not touch Singapore cases at all. The overseas students I met during internship did mention that it is a struggle to pick up legal knowledge on the job during internships so I would take that into consideration if I were in your position. For instance, the duty of care position (a common tort issue) is VERY different in Australia and UK. Also, take note of the Part A passing rates =)! Local students don't have to do part A.

Lastly, there is exchange opportunities if you want to experience an overseas education and the semester there will be grade free =) I rest my case.

*Is law school environment hostile and toxic?*

My answer to this is a resounding no. Like with any other place, there is bound to be politics involved and it is all about perception! As the common saying goes ""Do not do unto others what you do not want others to do unto you"". Besides the law population is so small, being a douchebag will definitely not get you very far and your reputation will definitely be in tatters.

The law school population is generally very very friendly. Seniors are very generous in passing on their notes and sharing any knowledge with juniors. There are regular collaborations among batches to pass on to the juniors eg. there was a very nicely compiled freshman guide this year and the y2(current y3) batch also compiled their internship experiences for the juniors.

My batchmates are mostly friendly as well and we do build great relationship here. My circle of friends share internship experiences, notes and any tips freely. So rest assured =) 

*What should I do before law school? Do I need to prepare?*

No, please do not, the effort to reward ratio is far too low because you can definitely be able to pick up studying again when you are back at school. If you really insist, you can do a legal internship and have a glimpse of the legal industry. However, the value you can provide is limited because you have not been through any sort of legal education unfortunately.

Go enjoy, do what you want and love. I personally went for the MOE Teaching internship and loved every aspect of it teaching kids, it inspired me to join volunteer work teaching children which I do till this very day.

Last of all, look out for the orientation activities painstakingly planned by the orientation committee. There is law camp, RAG, matriculation and pro bono among many other activities. PLEASE JOIN THEM BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST WAY TO MAKE FRIENDS FROM DAY 1 in law school trust me on this. More information can be found here on their [Instagram](https://www.google.com/search?q=nus+law+orientation&amp;oq=nus+law+orientation+&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2j69i64l2.4983j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/NUSLawOrientation/) or their official [website](https://nuslaworientation.com/matriculation-week). All these are to be updated and the first activity is usually the welcome tea in May followed by law camp in June.

19,SGExams,28786,[O Levels] Sec 4 here. Need advice on Poly EAE,f8665l,haewoo,1582441728,12,1,"Hello!! Is my first post here. I'm a girl who is currently a Sec 4 that is going to seat for this year 2020's O-Levels examination. So like i have been thinking on doing Eae recently, but i have so many worries. 

My subject combination tbh is very basic as I’m from a neighbourhood school so the combination is limited. I take English, E-Maths, Chinese, Combined Bio/Chem, Combined SS/Lit, Dnt. 


**Courses I'm interested in(not in order):**

\-Creative Writing for Television &amp; New Media in SP

\-Mass Media Management in NYP

\-Digital Film &amp; Television in TP

\-Mass Communication in NP/RP

\-Media &amp; Communication in SP

As you can see where my interests mostly lie on, tbh the no.1 I'm interested in is **Creative Writing for Television &amp; New Media**. Actually before, i was just only interested in JCs'. But idk one of these days, i just want to go to poly, as i already realise the great toll of stress that has been on me for just this 2 months of 2020 in school. Dnt coursework is killing me so much, I’m like one of the slowest of a small bunch in my class. Is just that I’m running for time. I have like 3 tuitions(Forced by my parents)&amp; Everyday in school I stay back in school for ACP &amp; dnt coursework. I don’t want to continue this style of studying anymore. I thought I was more on classroom style teaching, but I now think a new fresh change would be better. 

Tbh, I currently don’t do well in school.. Sec 1 &amp; Sec 2, I managed to do ok enough to receive twice of the Edusave merit award. When I reached upper Sec, my grades took a great bad turn. I have been failing chinese for my entire Sec 3 but I used to score mostly b’s &amp; now Weighted assessment 1 for this term, I failed too. 20/50, it was tested on paper 2. I just sucked at chinese comprehension(理解问答) My math has been up &amp; down. This term, I failed 11/30.  I didn’t had much time to study also. Well the subjects left for W.A is Bio/Chem &amp; Dnt. I gonna work very hard for those 2, so that my result slip for this term does not look that bad haha. Elective Literature, I’m always like stuck at around c6/5s’ area for my whole sec3. I really am struggling to increase my marks. English I’m always at b4, c5. My target is b3. These type of ‘language’ subjects tbh is easy to pass but not to score distinction. My chemistry is pretty shit I’m gonna say lol, but still in the process. Dnt theory I suck too n practical wise too. I feel like the guys in my class are pretty adjusted to it especially practical wise. There’s only like 4 other girls who takes dnt. Ik that is always a more male-dominated subject. Now I realise I should not have taken dnt, becoz I took bio for a reason. To avoid physics related stuff like circuits. Oh well, I have to deal with it.

Ok enough about my grades, now time to talk about the main thing that I want to ask all of you for advice &amp; help. I want to do EAE, but I think I have some disadvantages/Low chances. I used to be in Basketball CCA from Sec 1 until at beginning of Sec 3 when I changed my CCA to Environment Art Club. Due to the toxic people in the cca, &amp; it took up a huge portion of my time. I thought I would continue it to just bite through the pain of Training to Sec 4 but I barely have friends in that cca, &amp; I’m always excluded &amp; people in there are definition of toxic. My cca attendance is always gd &amp; same goes to school attendance, I only absent once in my 4 years. I forget to mention that I used to be in the Student council, I quit around the same time after changing cca. People just suck in there, &amp; the ex-cos in that cca are just toxic &amp; Teachers are biased &amp; blind af to them. I gonna tell u a stupid reason on why I joined SC, it was because in Sec 1, I kinda like crush on someone, a senior 1 year older &amp; turns out he was in council too. I really like him and always lmaoo cringe. &amp; my friend wanted to join &amp; she asked me to do it. But too bad, she didn’t get in. Upper Sec was killing me too haha, as I can’t really handle stress well if the social part is failing me. So I thought Sec 3 was a great time to quit, he stepped down &amp; i needed less commitments from toxic stuff haha. Yeah I was dumb in Sec1, making stupid decisions. Ik that my cca points wld be affected, so I had taken a long time to make that hard decision. 

I’m scared that I will not do too well or even well for olevels, so I think eae would be like a safety net for me. I still can go to Uni by that route if I put in a lot of effort. You know, my dream career is a teacher, journalist, scriptwriter. I hope that one day, I can be one of them.  Is just doing eae, my history of quitting student council &amp; changing cca, i think will affect me in a bad light to the polys. But I have a huge amount of passion for the courses. I don’t think I have much portfolio. I once contributed writing an article for my school’s ‘termly’ newspaper issue. I participated in a unseen poetry debate for the National literature festival &amp; won with my team. I went to a workshop conducted by rp once for mass com. I participated in a writing workshop conducted by the straits times that my school sent me &amp; a few other people from my school. Is that counted as some sort of achievement/something that list in my portfolio? 

Idk how to prepare my portfolio. What I can do is I can sketch things pretty well, as my Teachers complimented me. I remember my teacher asking me to take art, but I felt art o levels is difficult to score well &amp; I have an art block:( I enjoy editing pictures like quotes visually attractive(dw to compliment myself much, but I need to show my strengths, so that y’all can advice me) &amp; they come out visually attractive. I enjoy writing stories so I have some short draft stories. Pretty much hobbies. What should I create now? I think I should prepare some script drafts in writing? What’s a script, like how does it goes? As you seen my interests in those type of courses. Can any seniors or anyone give me tips/help/advice? Please!!! I’m not smart or anything, &amp; don’t have much talent. I really dw to be such a disappoint to my parents &amp; myself. I just want to one day reach my dream course &amp; then career.

20,SGExams,28164,[Poly] Can I seek help from a poly counselor?,f5nkb9,privacy--policy,1582007904,22,1,"Recently I've been really doing a lot of soul-searching and wanted to really improve myself.

24,SGExams,31497,[Post-Exams][University] Is it still possible to find constant friends in uni?,fr6gz3,untraceme15,1585491182,18,1,"so i just finished a levels last year and though i had a clique and a bunch of close friends who got me through my jc life, it’s still quite sad to say that i wouldn’t call them my constants... it’s fair to say we were only just close during jc for the sake of having a support system through the stress. and i guess that’s because i couldn’t really vibe with them rly well? perhaps only one of them but we don’t even hang after a levels lol 

so yea i’m just feeling q depressed and lonely rn bc i’m seeing how my other jc schoolmates hang out and gather together frequently on ig stories, and i’m rly envious of them to still hang tgt even after school &amp; exams. it’s such a blessing to have a constant group of close friends to hang out with frequently 

don’t tell me to not compare because really, i don’t think it’s that toxic / bad to be envious of others and self reflect once in a while

and it’s not like i can really ask my jc friends out because like i said we don’t rly vibe (and i cant rly be bothered to try too cos i know we can’t force connections) i still keep in touch w my sec sch friends but we’re rly just acquaintances who will meet once or twice every few months 

and for the very few 2-3 friends who i can rly vibe well with, we haven’t see each other for a v long time so it’s kinda awkward to ask them out and hang 1 on 1 for like a few hrs (it’s like a temporary getaway from the feeling of being lonely and that’s about it, kinda pointless imo) 

what i wld want is a close knitted group of friends where everyone connects well with each other and wld hang frequently (once every 1-2 weeks)? where we wld sustain a constant communication via texts, and u can rly tell anything to and confide in, not those friends who u know will be “there” when u hit them up kinda thing u know? it just hits different 

i’m also q an introverted person who takes time to open up, but once i rly connect well with u and open up i’m q fun to be around with (taken from one close friend of mine LOL) so ya i don’t think i suck at maintaining friendships, it’s more of the introductory making friends part that’s hard to me

sooo i was just wondering if it’s still likely to find constant non-fleeting friendships in university bc from what i read you don’t rly get to stick with the same bunch of friends all the time unlike in pri sch to jc, and coupled w the heavier workload, it makes friendships harder to maintain

i just don’t want to graduate and step into the working society lonely af without gaining a constant group of friends from my education lol :,,)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fr6gz3/postexamsuniversity_is_it_still_possible_to_find/,0.0,['HAHAHHA I’m in the same boat! but I blv it’s possible :)']
25,SGExams,31430,[JC] Rant about something's that's been on my mind for a while,fqn8bg,hondanihonkiku,1585412516,16,1,"
Hi, so I'm a J1 student and I've been enjoying my school life so far, having made a lot of friends (far more than I had when I was in sec sch and poly) and everyone in my class just seems really nice and friendly and I could get along with all of them pretty well. There's hardly any segregation into cliques in my class, so I'm really happy and grateful for that because I've never experienced that before in my whole life.

Until a few days ago.

Context: I'm the type of person to overthink things a lot and I've been trying to push it down ever since I entered JC because I wanted to be a brand new person and try to be as happy as I can be, but it's only been working out for the past month. My old anxieties of 'what if I offend this person' 'what if I say the wrong stuff' 'are they talking about me behind my back' 'did I say something wrong, why are they ignoring me (not on purpose, maybe I spoke too softly)' and these thoughts just fill up my mind and I slowly start to become more quiet and everyone notices it (because I'm quite loud and rambunctious in class and among friends) and ask me what's wrong and all, and I just shrug it off and smile again and everything's well again, so it seems.


These toxic thoughts keep filling up in my head recently and I don't know why. It's not like I've offended anyone (so I thought) but I keep getting the feeling that most people in class are sick of my cheery attitude in class and trying my best to answer questions in lectures and tutorials and it's really been hampering how I behave in class. And I want it to stop, but I don't know how to.

I'm really scared to voice it out to my friends because I don't want them judging me and thinking that I put on an act of being cheery and loud because that's who I want to be in class, that's who I want to be in order to feel happy. I'm hiding secrets, such as my sexuality, to them because I'm afraid that they might be homophobic (they often use 'gay' as like a funny term to describe a person's behaviour, and I don't really like it but I didn't ask them to stop either, and I just feel so shitty inside like I'm letting all of my fellow gays down) There're things that I don't fully agree with them either and sometimes I let them be known and I just feel like it's negatively impacting my friendships with them. 

There's a lot on my mind now, but it's midnight, so I can express only these thoughts coherently now. Thanks for reading it all, if you made it down here, and it's my first Reddit post that isn't a comment or reply to something haha. Good night!

There is quite a number of people who are toxic and even some who will backstab you for their personal gains but tbh it’s the same for many jcs. The worst aspect I feel is how sports CCA are seen as superior to clubs. One  example include how some sports CCA have reserved tables in the void deck (a place where students can eat or study) and it often causes displeasure when you sit at those reserved tables. I guess this is because ACJC sports cca often produce good results and seem to contribute more to the school hence, creating the sense of superiority.\n\nFor the arts department, I think Acjc has one of the best arts department in all of Singapore’s jcs. The history/econs department produces one of the highest distinction rate at the yearly a level exams. They also offer some special subjects like theatre studies.

Even though I think that I performed relatively well compared to my brother, my aunt kept saying that my brother was still better and other nonsense which bothers me, my parents were happy with me since they know that I come a long way since psle. Overall I went a merged JC (which before merger used to be one of my dream school).
However, what my aunt said along with what what my primary school science teacher said haunts,they both said that I was a failure compared to my brother.
Can someone help me with how can I overcome what my aunt thinks about me so that I can finally get peaceful sleep.
Not sure if this helps but according to my previous toxic classmate merge JC are shit which I don't believe is true but kind of sucks that people have that thought and that also bothers me.

I am writing out my mind now because I still cannot get over the fact that I scored badly for my 'O' Levels. I scored decently in PSLE and got into my school of choice. I have always been hardworking and diligent in school. Often, I attained good scores in school examinations. Even thought I did decently for Prelims (10-4=6), I did not do so well for my 'O' Levels (15-4=11) due to my pride and arrogance, as I thought that I did not need to study as much to score decently in the national exams. As such, I got into a JC where I do not want to go and life sucks ever since. The school is famous for its high abortion rates among girls. Everyday in school, my life is a struggle as I am surrounded by toxic classmates who shunned me like a plague, as I did not come from a missionary school. They think they are very smart and shit on neighbourhood school students. The teachers are not good either. They just simply do not know how to teach. They look down on us students and the student welfare is pretty bad. The school management is inefficient at communicating to the students and parents. Not to mention, school facilities are old and they suck too. Canteen food is the worst of all as I generally despise the food there. Basically the school learning environment is trash and I do not enjoy studying there. 
Sorry for the rant haha so guys o levels is a very important national exam and you take this seriously. Since now is cb rite, yall have more time to study and play. Rmb to take ur time to study hard and rest more if nt u will regret nt studying hard fr os like me. do take ur time to catch up with ur study and pls see ur teachers to clarify ur doubts diligently. stop complaining that ure from a shit school so u have no motivation to study hard and cannot excel in life. just suck it up for the time being and work 10x harder than b4. Just work hard daily fr urself if u wanna have more tertiary options to choose from and have a brighter future. o levels can determine ur path of education. if u wan more choices to choose from, study hard with friends via zoom or google meet to keep the motivation going. Theres another 4 more months to o levels so u can surely catch with the rest given this cb period. do not regret not studying for os by studying from today onwards. just make sure u got good grades so u can choose whr u wanna go for ur post sec education.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gpvj9m/rant_why_you_should_worl_your_ass_off_for_your_o/,1.0,['Damn dude with that much energy why not use it to “worl your ass off” for JC instead.

I hate how I can't seem to start doing anything and even if I did start, it's so hard to be consistent due to my full-time job. Shifts are always changing every week, people at work are toxic, none of my friends are taking the same path as me, most are already in uni either cause of their good grades, money or both. Some even have the privilege of going overseas for their degree.

And here I am, stuck and lost. Working cause of a 3-year tuition grant. Not financially stable if I stop working too. Really questioning if I can even do this and fulfill what I really want in this life.

I hate how I want to do something and I know what I am supposed to do but I'm not able to budge. Every day feels like a waste of my life",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gpbz3o/rant_private_a_procrastination_perfectionism/,1.0,"[""Taking private As this year too  it is extremely hard I know how it feels like everybody else may be fantasising and getting excited over their Uni courses while you just feel stuck and alone. I know it's hard but I'm so glad  that you are trying. It's not easy and takes a lot of grit. Moreover  you're working which is even more arduous. \n\nSometimes we really have to take it one step at a time. I do this a lot too but when life caves in on us we cannot criticize ourselves because if we give up on ourselves no one can save us. I constantly hated myself for bot being intelligent enough to get into Uni.  However , I slowly came to a realization that there's more to life than grades and university if you think deeply about it.  In  the grand scheme of the universe none of this matters. You have to find your purpose and have a great time while you're here but then again it is difficult to uphold such an idealistic view of spending your days and as long as we're living here on earth we still have to concern ourselves with reality including paying  bills, supporting our family and earning a livelihood etc. So yes we have to strike a balance between working hard and also spending adequate time to explore our passions and interests. \n\nFirst thing to note is , it is not too late yet. You still have time. Right now you can try doing your tutorials for each chapter. Perhaps you can try studying one chapter per day  for physics and then do practice and likewise for the other subjects. Once you've done practice for all your subjects to strengthen your foundation. Then you can perhaps try moving on to prelim papers and subsequently TYS to get you more accustomed to the  A level style of  questions. \n\nMental health is very important and cannot be disregarded. We really are our worst critics. I need you to know that it will get better , hard work does pay off. I think there's an app that provides free counseling I think it's called 2 cups a tea or 3 I'm not sure but something along those lines. I'll tag it below once I find the correct name of the app. All I can say I'm proud that even with all these obstacles you're still concerned and you want to change. That is the first step mate, kudos to you for that. Meditation is another thing you can try every morning and if you have panic attacks there are certain response measures you can do like focusing really hard on objects near you and trying to categorize them into a specific color, shape etc. If none of this works you can try going to a polyclinic or a community counseling center. You can try calling the Samaritans of Singapore too they are very benevolent and kindhearted. Sometimes telling our problems to a stranger helps. \n\n\nI know you'll be able to do it. Dont give up on yourself, you are worth it. Failure is necessary to push us forward and help us learn crucial lessons. It helps us fuel our determination. The only true failure is in not trying. I know right now for you life may not be going as you planned but trust me it has a way of working itself out and in the end you'll reach the same destination just that the route you take will be different. Dont have any expectations, just try your best and whatever the outcome may be believe that you have strength to overcome it. You only know what you're capable of when you're at your lowest. \n\nLastly dont be told hard on yourself if you procrastinate a bit , take sufficient breaks maybe study 1 hour and rest for 30 mins and repeat. You dont have to constantly sit for 6 hours to learn something. Find a learning style that suits you , are you a visual learner ? do you prefer writing notes or perhaps you're an auditory learner and you need to verbally repeat it to understand your concepts. Just aim to study around 4 hrs a day that should be enough with your full time job. There are so many resources available online if you need. ( Owlcove, tickninja, notes refinery,  testpapers.sg) Moreover they are free :). Have faith in yourself. There's nothing you can't do if you put your mind to it. \n\n\nHope you'll do great things in the future, all the best! I believe in you so you should too.\n\nP.S sorry if this isnt great advice but take small steps ar a time , dont rush into things. Reward yourself for the little things. Have a great day and great life. It does get better trust me !""]"

A little bit of background... I have dyslexia and I struggle to read and write at times. I come from sec 5 NA. I was tired of getting beaten up in school because bad company and tired of people telling me that I’m just lazy and stupid when all I do is study (even from my own family members who all come from express and never had to work so hard). 

I studied really hard to the extent of affecting my health. Got 9 points for O levels. People started to treat me so differently ever since I went JC. Ive never felt less stressed in my life. However, I know well enough I can’t afford to be complacent knowing that it took me a year longer than my JC peers to do O levels. So, I promised myself to not make any close friends to avoid drama and concentrate on my studies. One day, stupid me decided that I’m being too hard on myself and want to try a relationship when I started getting random confessions from guys in school. Was also pressured to go for it to stop more confessions from coming. Very dumb move of me. Didn’t realise sooner that I was in a very toxic relationship. I was doing fine at the start of J2, sometimes topping class tests. Grades started to fluctuate when ex bf kept disturbing me. Had a hard time getting out of it when he started getting physical with me nearing my A levels. Had to resort to lying to him that I cheated on him to get out. It was too late. A levels were already over. 

Got 63.75 rp and everyday I wish to retake As. Parents don’t let me retake because they think I’m already working too hard to the extent that it’s killing me. Had to apply for Uni courses that I don’t want. 

Just got rejected from all 6 local Unis. Appealing to all. Have a feeling I won’t be going Uni this year or have to go private Uni.

My progress with science subjects is very smooth due to my former experience in the workforce. However, I am struggling with H2 Maths and H1 General Paper.

1. How to practise 'toxic' Maths problems? Where to obtain Maths papers, especially during the circuit breaker? I have been practising sample questions and getting the answers, but am unsure of my standard when it comes to tougher questions.
2. For GP paper 1, how do I generate an interest in the topics? I don't really have an interest in any topics and can support my claims with individual examples or anecdotes from other people, which are considered 'weak arguments' from my teacher. (e.g for Crime &amp; Punishment, I read an article 'AAA got fined/jailed for theft'. I will only remember the gist after reading, like 'AAA got punished for theft' but I will forget the fine  amount, jail sentence duration, even type of crime --&gt; theft, but theft of what?) I don't even think I need to mention recalling statistics is even tougher for me. I hear things like 'create an example bank' but I have no interest in topics, but how to search for things I have no interest in?

In GP Paper 2, I have difficulties answering 'purpose of the author' questions. (e.g 'why does AAA use BBB to show ....?, why does CCC start his paragraph with DDD?, what is the intention of the author in using EEE?) I mean, I am not the author and am thus unable to accurately ascertain his/her intention in using these words. (e.g Like how toilet/ washroom are interexchangeable words that have the same meaning, but nobody questions ""why do you use 'washroom', instead of toilet?')

Personally, I used to be a very academic person (was never good at studying but I brainwashed myself to do it). Before I decided to leave Singapore I thought life was all
about studying. Long story short, one day I realised that mindset was really toxic and it was killing me inside. I knew I couldn’t be under this pressure cooker system anymore and decided to move to Australia where it’s less academic-based so I’d have more time to focus on myself and other aspects of life in general.
Of course it was quite a big turn from someone who was obsessed with everything about studies/degrees/qualifications to being who I am today. The biggest step was probably to overcome what others think (i.e. negative stereotypes about people who study overseas or more specifically Australia). I wouldn’t say I managed to overcome it completely but I am here anyway and I’m much happier now :&gt;

39,SGExams,35083,[Uni] Conflicted between SMU biz and NUS biz,gfbo0e,kdramasushi,1588874482,37,1,"Hi, i’ve received offers from both NUS biz and SMU biz respectively (did not apply to NTU biz) and have spent a lot of time reading up regarding both schools. One question i have is regarding the fact that many have been saying that SMU biz is more “competitive / toxic” in culture compared to NUS biz. Personally, i understand that both schools are competitive and competition is everywhere, esp in sg. However, i’m quite unsure as to what this “competition” refers to and why is it that SMU biz is said to be more competitive (and now have this as their school “culture”) ; which would ultimately make it harder to make genuine friends or is it equally hard across the board in all universities ): 

Also, the thing that attracts me towards SMU biz is actually because of the better internship opportunities and career guidance provided for the working world in the future (if i’m not wrong regarding this aspect) as compared to NUS biz, but many relatives have shared that they would prefer nus business which makes me really conflicted in my decision making process...): - nus business is said to be more prestigious and will be helpful if i were to be interested in an overseas job in the future

Personally, the difference in school fees is not really a concern to me and i would like to ask if internship opportunities are really better in smu compared to nus or it deends on your personal will to look for one; will the school matter?

and does smu have better networking opportunities compared to nus and hence in all, smu would be a better business school compared to nus biz?

!! another 2 things that attracted me towards smu in my consideration for smu vs nus biz is due to
1)  guaranteed double major for all students, however, i found out from my friend that the 2nd major in SMU is comparable to a minor in NUS/NTU in terms of the CU/AU/MC respectively ( where a 2nd major is 8CU in SMU whereas in NTU for eg it is 24AU) so this aspect of smu no longer ‘strongly attracts’ me 
2) guaranteed overseas opportunities for students in smu biz, however, currently nus new BBA curriculum also seem to have it compulsory for students to go through overseas exchange etc before graduation so this aspect is also no longer comparable between both schools 
 
another aspect would be nus is also currently already leaning towards smu teaching style for seminar based lessons and class part are also equally at a high % similar to smu,, 

so my deciding factor ultimately boils down to if smu definitely has a better internship opportunities &amp; career guidance provided for students.. also, smu has constantly been sending emails which does make me feel a little bit more like smu “ cares more “ for their students ; as superficial as it sounds

hi! saw a similar thread about poly vs uni and was curious about jc vs uni HAHAH. but i can’t seem to find a past thread on this or maybe i’m a bad searcher HAHAHA but what are the differences btw JC and UNI?

1. Academics: JC is known to be more intense and academics focused. oh &amp; it has a lot more projects than JC i guess. is UNI very similar to JC such that academics is super intense and many lessons are cramped into a 5 day work week?

2. Social Life: one assumption i have for uni is that you have to be social and be able to make lots of friends? like uni is a place for stepping out of your comfort zone and u have a better social life compared to jc HAHA. how true is this? &amp;&amp; does everyone like to go clubbing in uni? :o seems like a stereotype of uni students. 

3. CCAs: are CCAs compulsory in uni? some ppl take up ccas only for the sake of hall points or smth but are CCAs important other than for that reason &amp; also portfolio?

4. Portfolio: is it important to beef up ur portfolio in uni? do workplaces actually consider what you have done in uni/ contributed to society, etc. ? 

5. Environment: how true is it that people in uni can be very toxic and only befriend you for the sake of benefitting from you? i was talking to my teacher and apparently he had a bad time in uni and learnt to be more wary of people because of how people can be toxic :// i’m concerned about whether i can really make genuine friends in uni?

hope seniors can help us ! :-) thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/g8e3fa/uni_jc_vs_uni/,0.0,"['1. Academics: Many teachers said that a levels was easier than uni lol this isn’t the case. The academic rigour is definitely there (and more prominent in tougher courses). But the intensity also depends on how many MCs/AUs you take. Uni does feel more free because of the timetables or lectures may be recorded so you don’t have to be physically present (saves time from travelling). some people have 3/4 day work week. last sem i had approx 1 lecture and 1/2 tutorials on each weekday only. but what you’re studying is even more in depth so time has to be devoted to digest the content. \n2. Social life: It is not a must to be a social butterfly to do well I guess (based on what I have observed) although having friends and knowing seniors are important for sharing notes and doing cross checking of your assignments. If you stay in hall, making friends would be easier, but it is not to say that without hall you will be lonely - you can find friends in our courses from orientation or tutorial classes. \n3. Not compulsory. But ccas are important for networking, putting down in your resume, or doing something you truly enjoy to destress. \n4. Only in y1 so I cannot comment much, but I suppose it is q important (from what I have seen in the comments while browsing through this subreddit) and because theres competition to be directors/presidents of ccas. \n5. Environment: It really depends on people in your course and your personality/who you choose to associate with. I have found friends that would gladly discuss and check answers with, or cross check my essays and papers in great detail (likewise, I reciprocate their help). In a way this is somewhat transactional but we still do contact one another outside of class for non-academic reasons so I guess theres still a genuine friendship present. But I have also seen people wanting to befriend another person because of their scholarship status (its really disgusting), so I usually do not interact with them because this is toxic.']"

In sec 1 and 2, I continued to be very slack, and for the first time in my life, failed some exams (failed lit in sec1 and history in sec 2). I didn't even know PEEL structure existed until Sec 2 lol. In sec 3, however, I entered a ""smart"" class because I mugged 1 month before sec 2 EOYs and scored decently. Since then, I began working hard and actually did well. However, I started to base a lot of my self-worth on my academic results. At the same time, I began to be super perfectionist for every aspect of my life, like working out and other stuff.  I also tried to become super disciplined with dieting after my exams ended, to the extent I was borderline having an ED (I think I went from around 45kg down to 40kg.) Despite all this, I didn't feel depressed or burnt out or whatsoever and I guess my competitive nature fuelled me to try to excel in ""everything"".  

In JC1 (this year), I decided to let myself go, and allow myself to eat some unhealthy food, and not study when I didn't feel like it. This led to me losing discipline and developing lots of unhealthy habits. I began sleeping in class and not doing tutorials at all. During HBL, however, I decided to try to get my shit together and I did. I began studying but it was way harder than I thought (afterall, I only started studying in May and had to relearn everything in a month). Now I procrastinate studying everyday and sometimes I sit down at my desk and begin crying for no reason. My lack of motivation for studying is just one of my problems amidst friendship and relationship problems (I don't fight with my friends but in my head I constantly feel like they hate me even though I know the don't). 

JCTs are coming up and I barely studied the past 2 weeks because my mind just keeps wandering to negative thoughts which led to me crying almost everyday. I feel pressured to do well because my new classmates heard from my secondary school friends that I was ""smart"" and I'm scared that when I get bad grades they will realise I'm actually just an imposter. And I'm scared my parents will realise I'm not the genius they thought I was (they were really proud of my secondary 3 and 4 results). 

I wake up feeling jaded because I feel like even after all this is over and after A Levels are over, I'm still going to be tired and feel suffocated. (Aside from academics, I constantly find myself questioning if I'm ""doing things right"" or ""living life right"") I'm not sure if I'm depressed or whatever and idk why I wrote this maybe I just want somewhere to vent. Part of me already knows I have to let go of this mentality (I always had this toxic mentality that I can ""achieve anything I set my mind to, and if I failed, it means I didn't try hard enough"") and it will benefit me mentally and of course, in the long run, because if I continue being so hard on myself I will just be sadder. But since like Sec 3 onwards, this harsh mentality is what helped me achieve things in life. 

I'm not sure if this is exactly coherent, I feel it's a mess all over but if you read everything, I'm really grateful :"") Just wanted to post it here because there might be people who relate. 

TL;DR: I can't manage my expectations of myself and I think I'm burning out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hces4u/rant_burnout_and_mental_health_problems_in_jc/,1.0,['i’m so proud of you you overcame so many things']
45,SGExams,38754,[RANT] How do I deal with parents who are not understanding??,h9jmxc,imtired9447,1592238597,19,3,"I’ve been feeling quite depressed for a while, ever since I got rejected by all the unis I applied to. I have a borderline gpa with a slightly decent portfolio so I was quite shocked that I wasn’t accepted into any uni at all, even if I met the cutoff for last year. However, I tried to pick myself up and tell myself that the competition is just more intense this year and I should take a gap year to improve on my portfolio so that I can try again next year.

The problem is, my parents have never been understanding towards my issues. When they heard about my situation, the first thing they said was about how I never put in effort into anything and my shitty results is probably why I cant get a placement. They have never been through tertiary education so they don’t know what is GPA and how the admissions requirements are like. So when they found out that I wasn’t able to get into any local uni, they immediately thought it was because I did not do well for my exams and basically started pointing out all the faults they could find in me and making me feel even more shitty than I already do. I don’t even know how to begin to explain to them how competitive it is this year due to multiple factors and admissions aren’t based on just grades alone. They also kept pushing me to find a full time job, which I’m already trying to do although I am having difficulty finding one when most companies suspended their hiring processes. The thing is, I’m actually already working multiple part time jobs related to the degree I was interested in. They’re aware I’m currently working part time. And yet they still continue pushing me to find a full time job for what? So i can be even more stressed by juggling full time and multiple part time jobs at the same time? I told them its hard to find a job outside now and their response is just basically saying that I’m not trying hard enough.

I don’t dare to hope for them to be understanding towards my issues but I just want them to leave me alone. I’m already depressed enough because I felt inadequate for not being able to get into local u. And after what my parents said to me, I feel even more worthless as a person. I don’t take allowance from them and they don’t pay for my education fees either. So I don’t understand what gives them the right to be so controlling over me when I’m already an adult and they’ve never been through the same education pathway as I did so they have no right to say I don’t work hard enough just because I don’t show them that Im trying my best. To be honest, I’ve been thinking of cutting ties with them in the future because I can no longer deal with how toxic they are. It’s messing with my mental health a lot. I could be having a good day but if they are feeling irritable they’ll start snapping at me and saying i’m useless out of nowhere and then start having an one sided rant about all the dissatisfaction they have with me. And it really hurts me badly whenever they do that. I tried shutting out their shoutings but I can never forget the pain they caused me.

Am I in the wrong for getting rejected by all the unis I applied to?? For those who took a gap year or got rejected by all the local u this year too, how did you manage to make your parents understand your plight?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/h9jmxc/rant_how_do_i_deal_with_parents_who_are_not/,1.0,"[""hi! not here to provide solutions but just wanna say youre not alone in what youre going through! \n\ni got 74.25rp after mt which arent super amazing results, filled up my uni apps without any backups and im currently in the same position as u rn \n\ni guess, my family and friends are also wondering why i couldnt get into uni, but most of it is just me beating myself down. yes, i do feel ashamed that i may have to reapply next year when i could've most definitely avoided this outcome, that i have to lag behind my friends and take an extra year just because i made poor choices. but i guess, one way i went about it was to admit that i didn't do well enough for As, that i did uni apps without thinking thoroughly, that i truly made a mistake somewhere along the way. \n\nthe competition this year is indeed unprecedented, and it is no one's fault that covid happened, or that u couldn't get a spot in uni. there's not really a whos right or wrong in this situation, the most important thing is looking beyond this and planning ahead. im very sure that there is always a way to achieve your goals, even if it means taking more time compared to others. about your parents, i hope you arent too disheartened because if u allow yourself to wallow or begin to lose faith in yourself, no one can improve the situation that youre in right now. \n\nadmit that something went wrong, admit that you didnt reach expectations. but after that, pick yourself up and make the best out of what u have!""]"
46,SGExams,38523,[Uni] Advice on studying in a Japanese uni,h7euq7,linglingmozartybae,1591940162,4,52,"Hello, I'm a JC student considering to study in Japan after my A levels at the end of the year, and I would like to ask a few questions about studying in Japan. I've been wanting to make this post for quite a while and have only just mustered the courage to do so. This post might be a bit long and i apologise for that, but I would really love to hear from you!!! I couldn't post on r/singapore since i don't have enough karma.

I'm hoping to study music composition (specifically I’m interested in film music) in either Senzoku Gakuen College of Music or Tokyo University of the Arts(Geidai). I don't take any music related subjects in JC (I take h2 BCMTranslation), but I do have a musical background so I'll be able to prepare for the auditions. I know that Geidai admits students under the MEXT scholarship, but the official website doesn't really explain much about the scholarship itself, and I haven't been able to find the 'Music' subject under the 'Fields of Study' section in their application guidelines (I only found Social sciences/Humanities and Natural Sciences), so I'm kind of confused. I will look into it more after A's.

I'm not thinking of studying music locally after hearing from quite a few different people(including my music teachers) that having a music degree here wouldn't really get me anywhere realistically. I was actually hoping to graduate in japan and work in the music industry there.

Regarding my Japanese speaking level: I did Japanese O levels back in sec school, passed JLPT N3 in sec 3 (98th percentile), and N2 in sec 4 (88th percentile). I've also done a few exchanges with the Japanese Secondary School here in SG. Although I can understand around 85% of what is being said when I watch or read the Japanese news, I haven't exactly spoken the language since Sec 4, so I'm nowhere fluent as of now. I'm also well aware that N1 is an entirely different ball game and that I'll never be able to become truly fluent or as good as a native speaker.

My questions are:

* How realistic it is to take a gap year after A levels to work part time, study the language, take N1, apply for MEXT and familiarise myself with the Japanese musical terminologies? (i'm familiar with a portion of it from following the japan music scene for several years).
* MEXT: What is it like exactly? I haven't been able to understand much from their website. How hard is it to get it? How difficult are the papers?
* Fitting in: How hard is it to fit in with the locals? I've heard about the 'circles' thing in japanese uni's, how exactly does it work? For the people reading this who have studied/ worked in japan: what kind of experiences did you have?
* Part time jobs: Would it be realistic to take on a part time job while studying in uni? How hard is it to find a job as a student? What are the common jobs that students take on? Are the working times flexible? How is the pay?
* I'm aware of the pretty toxic working culture (hierarchy, ot, subtle racism etc) and the generally lower pays in Japan. I'm not 100% sure of what it's like in the music industry, but as long as I'm doing something I really like, I'm prepared to deal with them and I'm willing to make compromises to adapt.

Lastly, I would just clarify that I'm only considering to study in Japan. If all things go south, i would just follow my original plan of applying to NUS life science/ NTU biological science. The thing is that I've been considering studying music composition since secondary school, and not to mention that JC has successfully killed my interest in the all subjects I take. Music is the only thing that doesn't constantly make me want to fling myself off the balcony. But then again, according to the lists of international students on the university websites, apparently there hasn't been any Singaporeans studying in Senzoku, and there is currently only 1 Singaporean studying music in Geidai graduate school, so I don't really know if I should even consider pursuing this route in the first place.

If you've managed to read till this far, thank you so so much!!! I'd really like to hear from you so please do consider leaving your thoughts.

I had to churn this out during my recess so I apologise for any grammatical mistakes.

Thank you!!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/h7euq7/uni_advice_on_studying_in_a_japanese_uni/,0.95,"['* regarding the gap year, iirc mext scholarship includes a compulsory 1 year intensive Japanese study programme before you enter uni so there shouldn\'t be a need for you to take a gap year to study Japanese. also, the uni you eventually enter is based on your results during the 1st year so there is a possibility you may not be able to enter Senzoku/Geidai. as music is quite a niche area, it\'s also stated in the application guidelines that ""applicants may have difficulties in finding universities that can accept them depending on their majors."" you can check this out for more info [https://tinyurl.com/y87zx6px](https://tinyurl.com/y87zx6px)\n* \'circles\': they\'re something like CCAs and is probably the best way to meet local students and interact with them\n* part time jobs: it\'s pretty normal for Japanese uni students to have part time jobs (pretty sure we\'ve all heard of how they study like crazy just to get into uni and then from there they just put all their time in part time jobs/CCAs) so i don\'t think it would be unrealistic? not sure about how easy it is to get a job but i don\'t think it will be hard if you check out conbini/donki and the likes. can also consider the tax-free counters in donki/shopping malls as you know English and Chinese so that may give you an advantage\n\ncouldn\'t answer all your questions but hope this helps! i seriously considered studying in a jpn uni too back in JC and also looked up the mext scholarship but ultimately decided against it because i didn\'t want to spend an additional year just studying the language, and it\'s not guaranteed that i can enter the uni i want. the mext undergrad scholarship is also really competitive (whereas the graduate research ver is easier to get in but i don\'t think that\'s relevant for your course) so would be good to keep that in mind']"
47,SGExams,38321,[JC] dropping out of jc / taking As privately?,gzokkj,haseuul,1591714167,20,47,"hello! currently a j1 studying bcme (h1 econs) and honestly i’ve been thinking about dropping out of jc to attend As as a private candidate for awhile now, it just never really seemed feasible until hbl came along and it really made me see how personal directed learning suits my learning style so much more. 

with school—i can barely keep up with the content being taught, i dont have proper understanding or a good foundation because everything is constantly being rushed so that we can start on tutorials and practice questions, and additionally, nowadays i can barely do my work without referring to my lecture notes. even with the first few topics of the year like carbohydrates and lipids, everytime i try to go back to these topics to revise i just find that the teachers are moving on to a new topic and that i have to start rushing work again...its just an endless cycle of me completing my mountain of homework just so that i can hand them in. many times when i do these worksheets i dont understand whats going on at all, and it doesnt help that quite a few of my subject teachers are the type of teachers that would ask you to “google something” when you come to them with a question. this makes me so infuriated sometimes and just causes me to lose interest in my favourite subjects like biology and math... i dont really have the motivation to revise my work anymore. additionally with our school having extremely stressful mugger culture, i feel stressed every single day because my friends are coping so well with homework and revision. of course, this might be a facade but it doesnt get rid of the fact that i feel constantly overwhelmed and stressed with schoolwork. i understand that being overwhelmed in jc is pretty inevitable but its to the point where im up every night worrying about my content revision on top of the deadlines etc.

plus: my social life in school has been pretty hard, with my closest group of friends being extremely toxic and forming group chats without me speculating my each and every move. i’ve tried to take this with a pinch of salt but its really difficult when people in the school feed on any drama they hear about and especially there are rumours going on about me. ngl i chose this jc because it was a mugger school and i didnt expect much drama because this kind of stuff really takes a toll on my mental health and i find it so hard to avoid being caught up in gossip and toxicity in general, but look what happened on the end HAHA

i think what adds on to all of this is my class being extremely clique-y and that i don’t really fit in anywhere, i pretty much feel really lonely in school with no support system and a few toxic friends oops

so yeah, i’ve been talking to my parents and close friends about it but i’m planning to approach my teachers and ecg counsellor soon about this. i know most people would advise me to bite the bullet and pull through the remaining time in jc, but i’m really conflicted and on the fence about my decision right now :’)

don’t really have a solid plan on what i’m going to do if i ever drop out but i’ll probably be relying on tuition, lecture notes and also practice papers, plus working a part-time job to cover the tuition fees. i’ve seen quite a few success stories of private A level candidates on reddit but please educate me more on the pros and cons of this!!!

any advice would be greatly appreciated &lt;3

With less than 130 days to A-Levels and an absolute absence of motivation, I guess I'm done for. Halfway into the last year of my JC life, I've came to realize how toxic my group of friends/ study mates are but at this point of time clique jumping is definitely no longer an option. I'll still get jioed for study sessions, but IMO there's really no appeal given that I spend 80% of the time there answering their questions and solving their problems. I've even made it a point to rush home right after lessons just to avoid hanging out with them given how mentally taxing and exhausting it was. The thing is, my home is not really the most conducive studying environment (bad wifi) and staying in school to study but not with them just seems rude.

I just feel like I’m always being ridiculed through subtle commentary and treated like an idiot. Sure, I’m not super smart and I often ask questions about topics I don’t understand. But I don’t think that clarifying my doubts are wrong. There’s this jc guy in my class who often say that ‘if Idk anything just ask him’ cos he is seemingly ‘superior’ thanks to jc knowledge. We sort of got close along with another person (since we are the few active ppl in class) and I often ask him questions idk in a group chat with them.

It’s not that I ask questions everyday. Idk maybe I’m just overthinking or simply unable to take a hint. Nowadays when I chat with them (me replying but then not responding) I feel out of place and stupid when they talk abt their high scores and shit. Then when I score well they don’t seem happy for me but instead just continue to ignore me. This made me become very secretive and I just don’t feel that changing myself is a good sign of a lasting or happy friendship.

I am halfway through my prelims and I don't think I can do this anymore. Every since primary school I would score decently well for all my subjects. My parents never really had to worry about me doing badly. From sec 1 to 2 i started scoring worse and worse.

Coming into sec 3 a close friend of mine dropped out and I didn't know the people in my class very well. I tried to fit in and I think I was able to make a few friends. Towards the end of sec 3 I felt really sad. I started to self harm and cry all the time. I'm not sure why this happened but at that point of time I thought I could return to being happy anytime I wanted. Start of sec 4 I realized how toxic my closest friends were. They were always trying to bring me down and I became less and less motivated to study or listen in class. I began to convince myself that I was inferior to everyone and a burden. I lost all motivation to do any work at all. I began wasting my time and being more antisocial. Eventually I felt like i didn't exist to anyone in my class anymore.  

Prelims have started a week ago and I left half my papers blank. I tried to revise last minute but it didn't matter. I had plenty of time to revise beforehand but I never saw the point in doing so. Always negative thoughts popping into my head like I'm going to die anyway. And even if I try nothing will work out. My friends often tell me that I'm smart but don't know why I'm doing so badly.

I really dont think I'll be able to memorise all the policies of each market like i wanna do healthcare and at least one more market cos they r kinda impt but i really feel that i cant memorise everything cos i forget everything in a few weeks and especially this part i have never studied it before.

3. What do u guys think? Is it impt to study this part of market failure and are yall gonna study every market?

Last yrs a level qns for econs weren't that cancerous but i fell like Cambridge is gonna be toxic this yr and set some cancer qns.

4.Btw do yall know if we will have the same amount of time to do each paper for each sub even though some qns will be removed due to CLT?

Thanks guyss",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/i2v40g/a_level_975702_economics/,1.0,"['Hi! Am a J3 here so took a levels econs last year and if it matters got an A for it!  First off getting a B in your school exams kinda show that you are kinda good at econs I guess?? Whether to focus in micro and macro one advice I would give is to still keep your options open, don’t go into the exam hall being fixated on just doing more micro or macro cause you never know how the questions will turn out like they might suddenly give a really weird question that forces you to pick another:/ so I guess you can pick one to focus more on but still make sure to have adequate \nknowledge of all! \n\n1. For econs at least I don’t really feel like examples were really much needed! I felt more of the memorizing came from knowing the concepts and definitions of key terms (e.g. explaining your dd-ss movements/shifts or your AD-AS shift we’ll!) a tip I would have if you craft a standard answering format (only applicable for dd-ss and AD-AS shifts)  that Is mostly applicable and get your teacher to vet through your explanation of it! Usually if you can explain that well, an high L2 should be guaranteed. To reach L3, I feel the most important points are your evaluation and insightful links that you can analyze and produce in the essay. So per say having concrete examples memorized is not really needed but it is important to at least know of the general idea, as it can really help in your evaluation that will help you gain more marks! \n\nAs for the part on market failure, if you analyze the past year papers, you will realize that there would definitely be a market failure question as part of the micro essay questions. As much as it would be a pain to memorize, if you are able to understand and reproduce the right policies and problem they are easy marks to score! Personally I really like to do market failure questions! As long as I’m in the right direction the marks are guaranteed! Also it would be good to know the specific examples for each different market for market failure as there has been cases where A levels test the entire question on a case study that has been taught as part of the syllabus! (Linking back to examples as long as you know your notes and syllabus well no need for extra examples really!) \n\nJust some advice but when reading your question be really careful not to fall for the small tricks that Cambridge set in the question that can make or break your econs score :/ and personally I think reading sample essays and analyzing the answering and evaluation technique will serve as a good way to prepare for the a levels! \n\nGood luck!']"

Is this tru?***

2)Also, can anyone tell me what to expect for the entrance test for ACSi? (like as a malaysian shld i be worried about sg maths lol)

3)and also does anyone know the system that ACSi uses to accept students (like does the school have a quota of intl students that it needs to keep up to?)

4)Does anyone have any experience with boarding in the ACSI boarding school? like where are the majority of boarders from etcetc.

5) NExt, SJI and ACSI are like rival schools (rightt) I read another thread that said SJI is more chill than ACSi --- is this true? and like how would the stress in ACSI be??

6)Lastly like I'm not sure if like I'll be able to fit in well cuz i read from other reddit posts that people are quite tightknit and like there are like quite many cliques.

55,SGExams,43278,[Rant] my story as someone who should have fallen through the cracks,hyt9rs,lddjdokskssjis,1595860122,1,1,"I'm not sure if this is the correct sub to post in but I'll leave this here because it's mostly about the education system.

I come from a broken family (parents divorced when i was in kindergarten), and although I'm well-to-do, I'm not rich or anything and I stay in a 3-room HDB flat. My parents do not care about my studies at all and as such they have never sent me for any tuition or enrichment programmes.

Despite that, maybe because of the childhood trauma I went through (apparently troubled kids are smarter?), I ended up acing my primary school exams without having to study much and entered a top IP school. Unfortunately, probably owing to this very childhood trauma, my social skills were also stunted and in lower primary I was selectively mute and upper primary I suffered from severe social anxiety.

Entering an elite secondary school, I faced quite a culture shock because everyone was unabashedly so concerned for their grades, portfolios and resumes, and coming from a family where my parents had not once asked for my grades, this was very foreign to me. I tried to adapt the best I could, as I always had done, and I still did pretty okay academically, but as a result of my apathy, I did not manage to secure any leadership positions. In secondary school I felt that the culture was extremely toxic and elitist at the start, but tbh I think I got so used to it and I also felt too powerless to do anything that I just told myself that the best I could do was just to find a way to survive and not challenge anything. At first, I used to tell all my classmates ""study for what? studies also not everything"", and now, I am basically a true mugger at heart.

Now I'm in JC and at the start of the year I definitely did struggle a bit because I kept zoning out during all my lectures and basically learnt nothing from them (I had to re-learn all my topics at home reading the notes). I suffered a severe lack of motivation as well; I would get home at around 4pm and not do anything the rest of the day (or maybe start doing at 10pm and end up sleeping at 1am). Furthermore, I feel like although I have good friends in class, the bonds I have with these friends are pretty superficial as compared to the ones I forged with my secondary school friends (though I'm very thankful to still have a group of friends I feel comfortable around). On a positive note, although I came out of my recent exams thinking I just flunked everything and broke down at homrafter like almost every exam, to much surprise I still did pretty ok.

Up to this point this post probably feels like rambling, and it is, but here's my issue:

1. i feel very privileged to even have the opportunities to education but i can't help feeling a tinge of resentment --- since the start of secondary school till know, i have witnessed how family background has such a huge bearing on your results. i had to work doubly hard for everything i did because not only did i not go for the expensive learning lab tuition many of peers went to, i had to also keep up with doing the household chores around the house and also deal with parents who were very unaccomodating when i wanted to study (basically, would force me to do chores even when i was evidently having a breakdown due to studies) (my mom wld always threaten to pull me out of secondary school due to the high fees; it sucks even more when your parents aren't supporting you in your academics). as a result i am now just so so tired of having to juggle everything by myself and not being able to rely on anyone for help. 

2. coming from an underprivileged background, i also feel like i was set back from my peers from the very start, especially in non-academic aspects. my social skills were very stunted in primary school; i would basically cry everyday due to anxiety. now its much better, but i still feel like the repercussions are still trailing behind me. i couldn't seek help for my anxiety because my parents just aren't the type who would care about this stuff, so i just tried to ""cure"" myself by watching YouTube videos and observing how other people interacted. furthermore, childhood trauma, broken families, mental health are just taboo topics in singaporean society already, making it even harder to read out. 

in summary: it's just very difficult to survive and thrive in Singapore when you're disadvantaged in some shape or form.

lastly, i have not told any of my friends about my childhood trauma and my family background so naturally, they do not know of any of these struggles. reason being i do not want to be an object of their pity. but sometimes, it gets disheartening and lonely sometimes when no one truly knows what you're going through, and that's why I'm typing this post now! to share what I've gone through, to pat myself on the back and acknowledge my hard work (since no one else recognises it!), to share my grievances about the system, and to hopefully reach others that are in the same plight as me :-)

57,SGExams,41749,[Junior College] Discussion of study methods + Seeking advice on how balance relationships with studies in JC,hq6o7i,throwaw4yforpwsurvey,1594605466,5,1,"For some context I'm a J1 student! :) Recently I've been in a little slump and feeling demotivated. My attention span has also became really really short so I'm considering deleting social media as it has made me crave instant gratification every few mins and sitting down to solve problems take very long and I have lost the patience for it.

My old study method:
- Plan everything I want to study in a day on Google Calendar and plan the exact times I'll do everything the day before 
- I kind of plan a week at a time (during CB i planned for the whole month)
- If i fail to complete it I shift it backwards

This method worked at first but I realised I get very demoralised when I fail to accomplish my plans and have to shift them backwards. Sometimes I also over or under-estimate how much time I need for each task. I also feel extra anxious and over-plan sometimes.  Honestly I feel like I plan for myself to study so much more (maybe 8hrs+ on non schl days) than my mental capacity allows.

I was just curious about how you guys study  (structure/ timetable? Or just whatever you feel like studying). It would be best if you're a J1 too but help from all ages is appreciated!!! :)

*Relationships*

I've been in a BGR for about 4 months and I'm honestly kind of worried that I'll be unable to balance my studies or get into some fight during exam season which might affect my results. However, so far we haven't fought much and the relationship is generally unproblematic. My partner is also understanding and the opposite of a toxic and problematic person and sometimes helps me with work. I also hope to be with him forever so I believe sacrificing some time and effort is worth it. Just wondering if any seniors/ people in my batch have any advice regarding dating in JC and how to make sure it doesn't affect your studies.

58,SGExams,46738,[Alevels] [Uni] J2s pls read this,iqrs5y,imhappygirl001,1599835343,8,1,"Hi guys, I don’t post here frequently, but here's just an update! And hopefully a good read for those studying for ur upcoming Os/As.

So if yall have read my previous posts, yall probably know some of the struggles I had during J2 last year. So here's an update on Uni and life! For those struggling out there, I hope to tell yall that life is so much better now in Uni. Yes, its not easy but I am kinda enjoying it now. Of course that's provided you guys choose something you like or at least don’t mind doing. 

So, for my fellow Alevel juniors, if yall are feeling stressed or screwed or suicidal, think of the better life ahead you will soon have. Very soon.   

No more 6am mornings to go to school, but I have started to wake up at 6 or even 5:30 just to study. Then what's the diff then? The diff is that I am waking up willingly and am very satisfied that before noon, I could usually clock 5 hours plus of studies. The biggest change is probably my attitude towards school and studying in general. I can’t say I am very very passionate but at least I like what I am studying now and I know what I am studying for. Back in JC, I didn’t know what's the point of studying especially when I hated some subjects really badly eg. H2 Chem haha. 

My point is, if yall are feeling what I felt back then, aimless and dreading to sit down and study, what you need to do is just knowing what's your purpose of studying. In all honesty, mine now is just to get hopefully a 4.0 GPA and grab as many opportunities to secure good internships, exchange and eventually my dream job. 

So what should all of your aim be now? Don’t tell me 90RP. Not that its impossible, but is that what you really want? I personally think that many of us really just want to get to Uni. Or at least that was my mentally back then when I was less than a hundred days to my first paper. So don’t ever use the 90RP to stress yourself out again. Don’t ever do that! Its really dumb and counter productive.

Another point I want to emphasize is that if yall are finding it very difficult to sit down and study, thinking that all your effort might not even be fruitful, you are so wrong. That was what I thought back then too. But after going into Uni, meeting so many people of different backgrounds, some stalking on LinkedIn and talking to seniors, quite a handful of them didn’t do very well back in sec school or even jc, but what made a diff was that they did not give up studying. So just sit you’re a** down and start studying. You never know the results until it's printed on ur cert.

Even if you can only study for 3 hours, just study that 3 hours. Don’t think that its so little compared to others and hence not studying totally. That’s really dumb. In that 3 hours, you might come across one question that may be tested and hence u may score 1RP more. And that cumulates if you get what I mean. 76 could get you into FASS but a 75 might not… 

Lastly, on a more personal note, if yall are struggling with rs problems, hear this out. Today I properly talked to my ex for the first time since we parted last year. And yes, before my As. He felt so foreign to me, just like another guy friend. Though deep down I still love him, and I know we might never be together ever again, it was good to still be able to chat him up casually over text. Yes I admit I was feeling a bit down today and hence taking some time off to chill and write this too. My point is, eventually that someone you are hung up on might just be another friend of urs. So don’t ever slacken on ur studies cos of that person. Ur RP will follow you for life even if it doesn't determine your life… U get what I mean. So just focus on ur exams pls. There will be plenty of opportunities to date or do whatever yall want in Uni. Just saying, uni guys quite desperate so girls don’t worry that yall don’t have that SO in your grad pic. 4 weeks into Uni I have already met quite a few impressive guys.

Anyways forgive me if my thoughts are all over, I just hope to share my experience and hopefully change some of your mindsets and cheer yall on to study!!! Its not fun but hopefully next time this year yall can share your growth too! 

One last thing is that, some ranting posts here are quite toxic. Yes it's a rant but to those who really just want to get the best out of this subreddit, y'all can read those rants but don't let them affect u mentally. Yes some people are struggling, but that doesn't mean it's fine that u struggle too. Try to help them if u can, but don't think that oh there are people who haven't finished revision so you are safe too! No! There's also people who are mugging and can't be bothered to waste time on reddit. U get me..

61,SGExams,46017,[JC] things you hear about CJC,il0tsv,sleep_god123,1599023998,2,1,"I’ll be doing this in point form. 

1.”don’t come for science stream”

Reason is because of the way CJC teaches, not cuz of the notes. The notes are pretty good and sufficient. But it is the way they drag the lessons and focus so much on lecture notes more than the tutorials themselves. Dear CJ juniors, don’t just try to catch up and be ahead of the class with the tutorials and additional practice. Often people end up scoring below expectations cuz of the expectations CJ put for u, making u think doing lecture notes and doing the small tutorials is sufficient. Those who score well are usually the ones who finished the tutorials and started on the “essential practices”. Trust me many of your classmates probably never touched the essential practice portion since it is hardly gone through by Teachers.

2. CCA
after 2 years in CJ and hearing things from juniors and seniors, I honestly feel that CJC students are ambitious for the non academic parts more than the academic aspects. You see people applying for all sorts of leadership roles like SC, OGL etc when their results cannot make it. Yea usually these people are popz and people wanna join these to be among those type of people. Honestly, if your results are bad, don’t be such a try hard. 

3. Wrong idea about scholarship 
Your RP&gt; whatever your portfolio. Idc u president of whatever, you get Low RP, don’t even think of getting into the course, not even scholarship. Often I hear people who join so many things say things like, good for portfolio, I ask like for what, common ans: scholarship. Bro if your results are crap, your portfolio is like nothing. So pls pls pls, your RP matters more than whatever opportunities in sch.

4. Bad A level results
Well, we do produce decent amount of 80+ RP, few 90 RPs of cuz. The thing which differentiates them is their work ethics, pls don’t blame the sch. Honestly, when I saw their names, I was not even surprised since u always see them studying after sch like what a JC student should be doing. The thing about CJCis that you are put down for studying hard. My friend from VJC said they can be mugging and all’s good. CJC culture is toxic in a sense where it is cool to slack and score average. Yes scoring average is cool when u r a slacker here. Average RP can’t bring u many places especially with the bell curve. Drop your ego, don’t care abt people opinions in CJ and actually go to the library to study your butt off. 

5. “Bad pw”

Last year, I met these two girls, A and B. They were best friends, and are both really nice people. We had been getting closer, and I was happy that I could finally have close friends that I could trust. I would help them with their studies, and they would listen to my problems and comfort me and give me advice.

They are quiet, shy girls, so you would think we would be mostly spared from popularity games? Wrong. There is this guy M, one of the more popular guys in my class, quietly trying to sideline me. And his plan seems to be working.

I know for sure that M does not like me. Apparently he thinks I am annoying. I heard (not proven) that he sometimes tells his friends about A and B 'tolerating' and 'bearing with' me. 

Once, A told me that she felt really stupid, because she is failing a lot of subjects, and that she would never be good enough in her studies. I think M might have overheard this. On that same day, he went to 2 of the smarter guys in the class (who A has previously barely talked to at all), and requested for them to try to be friends with her, once again telling the boys that she is lonely, possibly depressed. 

Then shortly after the circuit breaker ended and school reopened, our class seating arrangement changed. B was now seated right next to M himself. Previously, M had little direct interaction with A or B. From what B told me, M has been telling her to treasure her friendship with A, and that there were many people she could ask for help for studies. He also introduced her to some of his friends. This was also the point when I felt that B was starting to drift from me. B now prefers to talk to her other friends rather than me, even though we were close previously.

You might be thinking that M might really be trying to help A and B, and this is all a misunderstanding. But here's the truth: He only started doing all these after I had 2 conflicts with him. I know his real objective is to make me just another normal friend of A and B, and make them drift from me. Then after that I do not know what he might do.

63,SGExams,44822,[JC] Coming to Victoria Junior College was the worst decision of my life.,icr8pb,throwawayvjcsucks,1597855357,32,1,"JC 1 here from an ""elite"" secondary school, l1r5 4 net and went to VJC as many seniors had also gone this exact same route and thought that I too could do it.
 
Other than the first few weeks of stress free orientation, I have never hated going to school more than ever. The school culture is a mix of bullshit and fake enthusiasm from the councillors as if to cover up the fucking stressful conditions that we students are subject to.

""Work hard, Play hard"" only applies to the top 20% of the cohort, for the rest of us, it is work, scoldings, tears and pain. I was never good at studying, and I only did well for Olevels by drilling and sheer luck. I knew JC was going to be tough, but this is not what i wanted.

Most tutors  favour only the ones that do well in their subjects , neglecting weaker students or even berating them for asking questions that they genuinely don’t know, even if the question isn’t very good or about a basic concept. Being a weak student without a proven studying method, everyday in school is just getting insulted and thrown around, with criticism centered around my own personality like   ""you might as well go back to secondary school"" or ""you're such a pathetic person""  when you cant answer the tutors question. In this school, your grades determine how you get treated by teachers, because ""grades=learning attitude=personality=worth as a human being ""  AND I HATE IT. 

Not going to talk about my class, as it would be too revealing, but certain toxic personalities esp this notorious ""group of 3"" make life hell as they compare everything and always make you feel like shit. 
My friend from another class also shared this same sentiment of how the IP kids ooze toxicity, and i cant agree more.   

I see my friends from secondary school having it so much better outside of this old, rotting prison with this aura of sadness and having the time, energy and the freedom to go out for lunch regularly after school. Going cafe hopping on weekends and yes they still experience stress from jc life but they have a nice learning environment, nice classmates and a community to support them. 
I never expected my life get to this point, I thoroughly enjoyed my final years of secondary school, I was happy and now these 6 months of VJC is making me lose sight of carrying on. 
Everyday, its a constant battle to keep negative thoughts away from my mind, but recently I see fewer and fewer reasons to keep subjecting myself to this pain. 
Family is trying their best to support me in this tough time, but they can only do so much, and despite trying,  i have been conditioned to think that trying is merely not good enough. 
I dont want to be just another suicide statistic, but really whats stopping me? 
Friends? a few remaining from sec school and 0 close friends in this cutthroat environment.
Religion? Closed for 5 months and these online cell sessions do nothing.
Family? i guess it is my final stronghold, but i cant go on forever like this can i?
I guess my strongest reason is hate, because id hate to fall victim to this school.

Im sure im not alone in sharing this sentiment about the school, but what can we do?
tired, stressed, scared, but still trying. 

To all sec4s and juniors who even think about this school, just dont.

there's also a part of me that just believes her, like maybe this is all my fault, maybe I really am as bad as she makes me sound, maybe I deserve this.

65,SGExams,44484,[Rant] Toxic mum?,ia1tr5,oreos5678,1597468977,22,1,"Hello everyone, just really need to get something off my chest here because I prefer being anonymous instead of letting anyone around me know how I feel (seriously, with past experiences this is the best way for me)

Okay, I am now in Poly Y2 and everything has been great so far. Good company, strong academics and financially comfortable. But I got here mostly by myself (except maybe my dad had indeed helped me with a few things when we were still on good terms)

To get straight to the point, I have never had a good memory with my mum. Eversince I was little, abuse in all forms took place. She had even let relatives know matters that should have been kept personal.

So when I was in upper secondary, I took matters into my own hands and did almost everything I could independently. Doing my own chores, took care of my acadmics matters myself, etc. Pretty fortunate to have a dad who would still give me monthly allowance that were more than enough even if we weren't on talking terms. 

Safe to say it has been a good 3 years since I last had full on conversation with her. I'm saying this because during those 3 years, the 'conversation' she tried to initiate was just her trying to tell me how i should just get out of the house just because I was not gifting her gifts or showing any form of affection towards her just like how my *other sibling* was. My mother displays strong favouritism in this household so you can see where I'm going and probably guess why me and my siblings despise each other.

Anyway, I've started doing things independently on a full scale and because she always has this idea that a daughter should be 'obedient, loyal, etc.' (you all know that mindset), lately she has been talking bad of me directly infront of my dad and *other sibling* as well as asking me to get out of the house just because I do not benefit her in any way.

I've been pretty numb to all her comments for the past few years but I just feel as though enough is enough. She's displaying petty behaviours of a secondary school kid and I can't let sh** like this keep on pulling me down especially since I've got big plans for myself.
 
If anybody was wondering, Yes, I have tried to reconcile our relationship by comprising myself as well as showing her affection but at the end of the day, she seems pretty insistent on just painting my *other sibling* as the golden child. And the more I tried to talk to her, the more she would belittle me during our conversations. My dad pretty much follows her lead and I have no choice but to cut my *other sibling* off because he/she was starting to belittle me as well eventhough I have not interacted/talked with him/her since 2016.

Sigh, Thanks for reading all this way if you did and sorry for all the grammafical errors that I may have overlooked.

I am a firm believer of stoicism despite all the toxic masculinity the masses tend to associate it with.

I had a girlfriend - Our relationship were built on friendship and subsequently it became a romantic relationship.

She had issues to say the least - she was battling with depression and suicidal thoughts. I pushed on to be with her and continue to love her even on days when is difficult to love. 

As time progresses, she started to change, the person I’ve grown to love her for has started to fade away. 

As she’s battling with depression, I became the sponge that absorbed all of the flacks. In time, I find it difficult to remain positive. I - too, started to feel the effects. One day, I snapped at her after months. (I’ve always stopped myself because I didn’t want to add anything more on her plate).

We broke up. Can you believe that? All these times when I have sacrificed my own happiness - she let me go because of a single swing of catharsis. Her friends made the situation worse by reminding her what a “piece of shit” I was for doing that to her despite knowing what she was battling. 

I admittedly cry and feel like shit for days on end. For the next 5 months of so I tried to convince her to get back with me and told her that with NS coming I’d be able to focus on her. To no avail.

Her Polytechnic grades drop to a point that she can’t make the cut.

I continued to tell myself that I’d be better off without her

So what’s sad here? 

I thought that when I win a major competition- I’d get over her

I thought that when I got offered from NTU/SMU/SIT - I’d get over her

The point is, we’re humans right? Sometimes we don’t know what we need. It is crucial to let yourselves feel through the motions and let it define us for the better, always. 

I was wrong, 

I thought that if I had this - I’d get over her

I thought that if I had that - I’d get over her 

The only constant is time and with time
it will get more manageable with each passing day and eventually it won’t matter anymore.

I hope that all of us can stop thinking that we need to score to validate ourselves - thinking that a mere ego boost will be a bandage to our broken heart

I know she wasn’t the one, if she was, she wouldn’t have given up so easily. I can feel disappointed but I will not go on to live my life wishing that she was the one.

68,SGExams,50499,[Rant] Awful Experience in CCA,jcxj7e,S-LeagueTeaDancing,1602949913,8,1,"Already graduated from my CCA, but I wanted to get this off my chest:

My experience was from a performing arts CCA. We were considered above-average in Singapore (Distinctions at the Singapore Youth Festival, word-of-mouth, etc) and we prided ourselves on having high standards. The alumni network was quite strong, so we knew this for a fact, that having high standards, taking pride in our work, and standing out in the crowd was a tradition in the CCA.

Our batch was noticeably different from most of the batches that had come before us. The passion we had for what we were doing was noticeably lower, and our standards were also lower. Then when it came to selecting our leaders, we CCA members had very little say in determining them. Power was mostly concentrated in the teachers and instructor. But to be fair, people were generally fine with it because in most years they were able to select competent leaders that could represent and take charge of the CCA well.

But I guess it was bad luck, or poor perception, that some of the leaders chosen were dismal. There were 7 of us, with the main CCA leader we'll call V and the assistant known as Z. As it happens, most of the 7 were Christians that were of the non-confrontational type (as they admitted in retrospect, their upbringing had made them initially highly reluctant to thrash problems out with each other). I wasn't that type, but you know, peer pressure made me less proactive at first as I would've liked to be, which honestly was quite regretful.

You can see where this is going already.

Initially most of us were highly reluctant to sort out problems, especially with V. V was more or less an exemplary CCA member, but as a leader V lacked organisational skills and persuasiveness, among other shortfalls. And even as most of us knew of them, we were all reluctant to let V know. It was only after we flopped our first project as leaders, did we start to be more willing to thrash problems out with another.

Yet, things only improved marginally. Our standard remained visibly lower than other batches, and leadership was still weak. V remained bad at completing duties, and we found ourselves having to step in to clean up after V, or to save things from falling apart, too regularly. Even worse was how Z, who stepped up a lot after our first failure, was unfairly blamed for a lot of things, though it had clearly been V's incompetence in getting things done. Not much was done to rectify the errors in Z being unfairly pinpointed, partly because of V's inaction, and also partly because some of us 7 leaders were good friends outside the CCA, and did not want to sacrifice their relationship.

And the alumni network I mentioned earlier? Those in touch with the current affairs of our batch and the goings-on had an inkling of how bad things were becoming, and were honestly very nice in intervening to help solve the problems we had. It did help, but only to an extent.

So now as I look back, our time as leaders in the CCA were mostly marked with failures, with minimal successes. Even with help from the alumni, teachers, and the instructor, our batch remained weak in comparison to others, and leadership remained absolutely dismal. We left a sour legacy. And for someone who was very interested in what I did in CCA, I lost most of my passion for it. 

From what I know, V doesn't even seem to be in the least bit remorseful for being an absolute burden to the 7 of us. V was often hesitant to sacrifice grades (which were already pretty good) just a bit, to properly fulfil responsibilities as a leader. The batch that came after us had a hard time, with our incompetence as leaders and as a batch being one of the causes involved.

And V? Still scoring well academically.

If you see this and somehow are able to connect the dots, I hope you rot in hell, V. You made life during our tenure as leaders virtually a living hell. Our mistakes and areas for improvement were clearly laid out, both by each other and our teachers+instructor, yet you were the one that showed next to no improvement and continued to weigh us all down. 

Remember the special feature at \[X performance venue\] that didn't happen because you failed to coordinate what was instructed of you, despite having so much help? Yes, that's on you. Remember how you were the one out of all 7 of us that was arguably least connected to the rest of the CCA? Remember how you often had little clue what was going on, regardless whether within the 7 of us or within the CCA, because of how poorly connected you were?

And for O (another member out of the 7 of us). Remember how you were more focused on your own image and how others thought of you, over getting things done and things were up to task? I really do appreciate what you did to help unf\*\*k V's chaos, but you still caused a whole set of problems because of your revolting princess syndrome (wasn't even me that started using this term, someone within the CCA introduced me to this).

**To those reading, you may be thinking that this was a hellhole of a toxic CCA. You're absolutely right. But things only get toxic when duties aren't fulfilled. In a normal CCA season, we have fun, we feel satisfied with our work, the beef we have with each other is normal, but because of sheer bad luck, we end up with incompetence in the top ranks of the student hierarchy that throw things absolutely off course.**

So far, studying at home for the past 3 days has been HORRENDOUS because my house is the complete opposite of what a conducive environment should be. for the past few months, every school day i would study in school until school closes and take the rest of the day off from studying, and every weekend i would go to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital to study (which isn’t the best seeing that its a hospital), but now i’m kind of hesitant to go to the hospital to study every day since a hospital has more risks of getting Covid (i think? correct me if i’m wrong), so i’m just trying my luck here to ask if anyone knows anywhere that would allow students to study for a couple of hours? Usually during the weekends/during the 1 week term break i would leave the house around 9.30am and leave the hospital at 6++pm. I don’t think the libraries are fully opened yet, the last i heard, a friend told me that the libraries would only allow you to use a seat for 30 minutes max, but i never really liked studying in libraries in the first place.

( i’m not saying this because of jealousy or because of petty beef but she genuinely isn’t a good person. ) tbh it’s super fun with them and all but the only problem is that the girls are fake..... i never knew if i could be myself around them / genuinely like them because i don’t even know if they liked me genuinely ..... and tbh i never had a bad reputation until we started hanging out together LOL everyone started to think that i was just like alice just because she was in the clique. i mean i totally understand why they would feel that way but it sucks because it’s SO INSULTING to be compared to her especially when i know that IM NOT LIKE HER. i tried to drift away from the girls and i thought it would be easy because we went to separate classes but WOW was i wrong. in fact, i’m still closer to them compared to my classmates... i can’t relate to a single person in my class. i have a clique in my class too ( 6 girls including me ) but they are way too studious, too serious and the bond just wasn’t there AT ALL. couldnt talk to them about anything other than studies ( i’m in a sap sch btw theres a strong mugging culture here) and i couldn’t find other friends either because they didn’t dare to interact with me ( afraid that i would be a bitch like alice ) and even if i made new friends, they didn’t dare to open up because again, SCARED THAT I WOULD BE LIKE ALICE. i’ve always been one of the well known girls in school since primary school, except that IN PRIMARY SCHOOL, i actually had friends. i actually enjoyed everything about school. i didn’t have to worry about whether someone was gonna backstab me, or if they even liked me. i didn’t have to walk across the canteen alone feeling like everyone was judging tf out of me. i didn’t have to worry about shit like this at all. it frustrates me so much that i couldnt find anyone that i could relate to ( other than my bestf that stuck with me since the first day of sec sch) well....  my secondary school life basically ended with me having 0 attachment to school or anyone WHICH SUCKS ASS because most people find their lifelong friends in sec sch. adding on to the fact that im from a mugging culture sch, GOD DAMN DO I HATE THIS ENVIRONMENT???? u enter the school and u see people studying in the canteen at 6.30am. ENTER THE CLASSROOM and everyone’s flipping books. not for me AT ALL. not a single part of me misses the environment because everything is fixated on results RESULTS AND RESULTS. everyone compares like crazy. like 89% of my school goes to JC, with more than 50% of them entering the elite JCs. i can’t relate at all😭 my grades are above national average but always below school standard and i hate the unnecessary pressure and stress from everyone.

Perhaps it was my class allocation that had forced me into some of the toxic people I met. Perhaps it was the stress from IB that drove my mind into such negativity. Perhaps it was sheer misfortune that I had been given such condescending teachers. I understand now that what I had gone through in JC was largely individualistic and subjective.

To those who are potential JAE students and had seen my post, please know that my views are not biased and should be taken with a pinch of salt. Like I said above, my claims regarding the school's culture and faculty are based entirely on my viewpoints and a few others' viewpoints. It's not wrong to factor in an alumni's views when considering which JC to go to, but also remember that it is subjective.

In retrospect, I was probably just sad that I couldn't mix in well with the bunch. Likely cos I lack personality or something lmao which was what one of the commenters of the previous post had said my JC was full of, which in a way kinda struck a chord with me. Anyways, I think that was what tempted me to rant off my negative views of my school. To those who had similar experiences as me in all the JCs, hey, welcome to the salty club, at least your not alone. What really matters is that despite all the hardwork, all the social stress and whatever that is going thru in our life, we are resilient enough to pull through everyday, and I think thats important especially in future when responsibilities start piling up on us as adults.

I will be deleting my previous post, so that it no longer spreads any more negativity. To anyone taking IB or A Levels, or are pushing through poly and ITE, I just want you to know that you're a god for making it this far in life and we should all continue to strive for happiness and excellence.

It is honestly amazing how toxic people in school can be. They can put up this persona of being an all round nice person until when you start to know them you realise that they exude pure, stinking selfishness. This comes from the perspective of a student in a higher-tier JC, so this may not be so surprising to you. But honestly when I compare my experience to the experiences of my other friends from RJC and VJC, I can't help but think that my school is so much more toxic. Also, please know that what I'm about to say does not represent only my experiences, but also based on what I've seen or heard from others.

First of all, the population of hypocrites in my school is so staggering. There is this prevalent culture where if you don't match the traits of a group, you can just gtfo. Not a mugger? stop asking us math questions. Not chio enuf? I don't wanna talk to you. Not rich enuf? can't eat with us. Why can't people just accept others for who they are? Fine, if they're just not your type, you can just not talk to them, but that doesn't mean that you should avoid them or literally pretend they're invisible.

Second, there is literally zero mutual understanding. Everywhere in school, it always feels as if you're on your own even when surrounded by classmates or peers. I once seen my classmate drop her paper on the floor, and she literally had to walk halfway across the room to retrieve it even though the person nearest to the paper can just pick it up and pass it back to her. Also, there is always this subtle stigma where if you ask someone a question, you're just being annoying or something is to be expected in return. It is so passive aggressive, so much so that I have refrained from asking questions to my peers and resorted to asking the teacher instead.

Speaking of teachers, they are also part of the problem. They expect us to hand in work on time, do well on tests etc., that students who simply cannot cope with the stress are unable to meet their expectations. It is because of this that the teachers are always shooting death glares at them, as if they just committed a crime. Yes, some people are just lazy, but those who legit cannot tahan the extra workload now get even more stressed because of the pressure from the teacher. While I have no problem handing in work on time, I feel that those individuals who are stressed out of their minds are gonna feel more degrading and shameful, which once added on to their stress can really take a toll on their mental health.

I know all these seems like a ill-structured argumentative essay, but the point is that people need to be more genuine of themselves and to others. The element of trust between people can only be hampered by pride, ingenuity and hypocrisy. Thats why so many people complain about 'snakes' in JC. If you try and mould yourself out of the sea of mediocrity by forcing out your 'onz' personality to fit the upper echelons of the JC popularity status, it will eventually culminate into a toxic environment where no one will trust each other for the fear of 'fake people'. I also understand that some people wish to open up in JC, and I respect that, but understand that you must also acknowledge those around you and treat each other well. I apologise if this seems like a squabble from some salty dude who didn't enjoy JC, but I also thank you for reading any part of this nonsense.

77,SGExams,47746,[A Levels] What is the culture like in your JC?,iypk4z,Glioblastoma21,1600918435,62,1,"I'm sure many of you have already seen the various posts enquiring on the cultures of the various JCs. I have a few questions of my own, please entertain them if you have your own/friends' experiences to share! I'm sure they will help many of us make informed decisions next January. 

**RJC** : Is it true that RJC is a ""mugging school""? Are students toxic and aloof towards one another? Is there an air of elitism among the top students? I come from a ""neighbourhood school with an elite name"", so my biggest concern is that I will be looked down upon and ostracized by my peers. RJC will likely be my first choice, unless the experience will be difficult for me. 

**EJC** : Many people on this subreddit have discouraged me from going to EJC, as they claim that the school discriminates JAE students, while they treat IP students like kings and queens. I'm well aware that 60-70% of the students come from CHIJ st Nicholas, Catholic High and SCGS, so it is expected that integrating into already-formed cliques will be a Herculean task. However, the ""toxicity"" that current EJ students speak of is far more severe than that. Some EJ students on this subreddit have mentioned that while the aforementioned IP students were still in their respective Sec schools, their teachers often aggrandized them and reminded them that ""they are the top 1% of SG"". They also say that EJ students ""look down on JAE students"" because of this brainwashing. So, is EJ really as elitist as some students make it out to be? Will I be able to integrate into EJC comfortably as a JAE student? What is the culture like in EJC? 

**NJC** : ""If you leave your study notes, phone and computer on a bench and go somewhere else for 5 minutes, only your notes will be stolen"" is an anecdote that I often hear. NJC is also another school that my friends have dubbed a ""mugging school"". Are the rumours true? What is it like to study in NJC as a JAE student? 

**Hwa Chong** : Despite being one of the best JCs, my sister (current JC2 student there) has described Hwa Chong as ""fun, playful and relaxed"". Students ""know when to play and when to be diligent"". However, according to her, there is a strong stigma against students who join the student council. I may not have had much leadership experience in pri+sec school, but the idea of becoming a student leader recently became appealing to me. My sister told me ""if you want to die then go ahead and join the student council"", because student councilors apparently get labelled as ""clout chasers"" or ""teachers' pets"", and they often get disrespected, ostracized and bullied by their peers. ""Student councilors only hang out with each other because no one else likes them"". Current/former Hwa Chong students, please share your experience in the school, and confirm the accuracy of my sister's anecdotes.

**NYJC** : My father lashed out at me when he heard that I was considering NYJC among my top 5 choices. He said that it was ""a school for uncultured hooligans"", despite my consistent reminders that the COP dropped to 6/7 points. I don't understand where he's coming from, and I am really skeptical. Some NY students on this subreddit have described it as ""fun but serious"", while others have called it ""the playground for China scholars"".

To those who feel that friends don't respect you or friends being toxic, I feel you. I have been there too. In my lower Secondary School years, I was constantly ignored by my classmates and sometimes even made fun of by my classmates and sometimes even bullied. I used to be like some of you guys out there, affected by these comments and feel down and low. I understand that you may feel unhappy, disappointed, angry that these people are being toxic to you. JUST IGNORE THEM! WHAT DOESN""T KILL YOU, MAKES YOU STRONGER!! Choose to ignore them. Even if the whole class hates you, just choose to ignore them and continue to lead you life, proud and confident. Raise your self esteem. If you are like me, bullied in my lower Secondary School Years for having a different mindset, being different, just remember there are people out there like yo. JUST IGNORE THEIR COMMENTS AND DON""T CARE. I understand also that you may be triggered. Keep your ego down. I will honestly say this, in my lower sec years, I had a completely different ambition from the others and was laughed at, friends did not respect me. Some called me stupid, some called me retarded, some called me a bitch. BUT LATER ON, I chose to ignore these COMMENTS and continued to lead my life. To those facing toxicness from friends or friends verbally abusing you, stay away from these people and ignore them.

To those out there, I just want to say, accept criticisms. If someone criticises you for your ambition or what you are doing now, they are probably jealous. Don't let these comments affect you and continue what you are good at. People will be jealous at something you do, they will even hate you when you achieved what you want.

80,SGExams,56110,[rant] toxic parenting,ju1i5f,goldendoodlemunch,1605358380,42,1,"Hi everyone I’m here to rant about my psychotic mum .. 

She’s biased towards my other siblings and she just loves to pick on me for no good reason really. And no matter how hard I try to please her(I really try to help her and stuff) she still doesn’t see my efforts and she just puts me off by saying i’m a horrible child. So i should just stop helping her right? Plus, if I do smth I’d get scolded for it, but if my siblings do the same shit they won’t :-)

This crazy parent of mine expects me to be home by 9pm everyday, regardless of whether i’m studying and whether it’s a weekend or not lmao. During the circuit breaker shit, I was forced to stay at home with her. It was really fucking torturous. I’m taking my A’s this year, so I’m alr stressed out but she decides to take her OWN STRESS out on ME. I told my dad about this(how she’s scolding me for no goddamned reason and throwing tantrums), and all he said was “She stressed over work, just be understanding” bruh then who tf is gg to be understanding towards me????!! Anyway during this period i was fucking stressed cos of her + school and not only did my mental health worsen, I even missed my time of the month twice? Basically she just loves to pick on me and there’s no good reason for that other than i’m a daughter???

She talks to me super rudely, while she talks to my siblings very gently. Once, I replied her rudely cos her tone was rlly rude and I just couldn’t take it anymore, then she scolded me and said why are u so rude? I said she was rude to me first, and she said she can do that bc she’s my mother. I swear parents who say such things rlly don’t deserve to be parents. They think just bc they’re parents they can say and do whatever they want. 

Also, she’s super stingy with her money when it comes to me. If i request for something, she just says no. Even if it’s v cheap like $10...... (Im from an ok background) Then when i get it myself she scolds me and says that i’m v rich and threatens to take away my bank card...???? It’s my money hello?? And u didnt want to get it for me??? Meanwhile if my siblings ask for smth, she’ll get it for them lmao. 

Anyway, I really can’t stand this toxic environment anymore. Its affecting my mental health a lot, and so much so that i realised that i can actually be a toxic partner in my relationship. I’m so sorry to those traditional filial people here but I really hate her so much. She’s the reason why i dread going home everyday. Even my dad comes home at midnight now. I’ve been working hard for As because I want to be financially independent and really get into a uni so that I can enjoy hall life. But recently I brought it up to her and she immediately shut me out and said no. I feel so helpless and it’s like all i’ve been working so hard for all these while has been gone to waste. 
It really pisses me off knowing that I can’t even enjoy freedom, not even till my mid 20s. I hope no one ever experiences this horrible shit. And I would appreciate it if any kind soul has any advice for me. If u have read till here thank u for listening to my ted talk :(

1. How's the school environment? I've seen so many people commenting about how toxic the school environment is and I've also seen so many others saying that the school is very welcoming and people are friendly, I know this differs depending on what kind of people you meet and what class you have but I just wanna know the general vibe, maybe someone in j1 or j2 this year can tell me how's the school now since the vibe will probably change every year with a new cohort joining the school.

2. How are the facilities? I've seen comments talking about there not being aircon in some of the classes but that's not a problem for me, just wanna know about the condition of classrooms, are the tables and chairs nice and new? Are the bathrooms clean and relatively new? Are the computers in the com lab good? And how's the canteen? Is the food good?

3. What time does school usually start and end? How long is one period of lesson? How long is cca usually? And if I were to join a sports or performing arts cca how many times a week will I have practice?

sec 4(NA) but surprisingly I get a B4 for my n level and I’m very happy about it ! but my teacher said that B4 for n level standard eng is still counted as pretty bad:( fast forward , this year(sec 5) my results for eng have always been D7-F9. I tried and worked really hard for english despite everyone told me there’s no way to study for english. I managed to get 47.5% for eng during prelims, honestly I’m really happy that i almost pass my eng! however , I am super super scared that what if I get E8/F9 for o level eng????? I just want a C6 ... a pass ......


personally I found paper 2 is actually manageable I told that to my friends and they laughed at me because they said it was difficult and there’s no way that I can do better than them in eng since I have the worst eng result in the group( pretty toxic, it rlly hurts me and I was holding my tears when they are laughing at me that I probably done the whole paper wrongly since it’s “easy” for me) ANYWAYS I honestly think it’s manageable okay😭😭 I actually understand all the texts!!!!!!!!! there is no words that I don’t understand and I found 10-12 points for my summary I THINK ? but it’s really difficult to replace the word with another word with same meaning hais :( and I exceed the word limit accidentally.... the word limit is 80 and I wrote 85 bruh but it’s too late to change cause time is up:) 

for paper 1 : 
despite the ans that I found online might not be accurate but I get a 4/10 for editing. For situational writing, it’s probably the best situation writing I did:') I am really proud of it , I actually have good reasons to explain my points and I used up all the pages ( I had to ask for extra paper in the end) but I know lah write write more doesn’t mean better. 
however , because I was too focus on my situational writing I totally forget to check the time and I only left roughly 25mins for my continuous writing. I usually choose personal recount bcus it’s easier for me but I chose the last qn idk what’s wrong with me ( the qn : there is no place like home do you agree) BUT BUT this qn is very similar to the qn that came out during my prelims !! so I literally just copy and paste my prelim compo para 1 and 2 lmao however due to the lack of time I only left 15 mins to complete the rest. I really stressed out at the point i couldn’t think of good points and I can’t rmb what I wrote during prelims except for p1 and 2. I suppose to write 2 points why I agree 1 point I disagree but I can’t think of the disagree part at the moment so I just give up and go straight to my conclusion to make my compo look more complete??????? So total I wrote 1 para intro+2 paragraphs why I agree+ 1 para conclusion.

for my oral I was quite confident I got a 20/30 for my prelim oral( that’s good in my opinion okay🤣) my o level oral topic is about cycling and I was quite confident about it since my bf is a competitive cyclist HAHAHAHAHA so I just say my friend( I can’t say bf lol) became a more resilient and determined person through sport blah blah blah

 I sit here the night before my chemistry paper 3 knowing that I did badly for my previous papers, hopelessly trying to do chem now so that I would be fully prepared and no questions can trick me, but that's a lie, I can never be fully prepared, I can never get full marks, I am bound to make mistakes cause let's face it, I'm not that smart. 

I come from a school with a mean 62.5rp, yay, fun, my o level results are far from the schools average but oh well I am grateful for being here. Along the first few weeks, the 2018 batch got their results and there were 2 90 RPers among 600+ students, while most of their rp fall ard 60-70 rp, which was quite demotivating - to realise that my chances of even aiming that high was like 1/200 probability and that I can get a rp to go to my desired course. This stats always pulled me down, every decision I took J1 was based on that statistic, I had no goals in J1 because every goal was impossible, even if I studied and practiced ppr more than anyone I was bound to fail because I felt so inferior even among ppl and even those in my class, and I lost the battle before it has even began. 

JC2 strolled ard, started of w being motivated I think, but then it wore off, noone in my school was motivated, and as the saying goes: you are the average of the 5 ppl u hang out with. I didn't let that happen because I did not make any friends, but eventually I just let go and made friends. I stopped putting extra effort and settled following the recommended workload and just doing HW and tutorials (+ extra revision and additional questions). I didn't fully let go tho because I had some hope that my worth was not attached to the school I go to. 

However, that didnt stop the little voice in my head going like: what's the point, even if u put in all ur effort, you cannot get a good rp to go to uni, look at the stats, numbers don't lie, you are just being too idealistic, the ppl from other schools are gonna outperform u in every way (like even if I did every single prelim ppr from other schools and get like 80%+ for it, my brain somehow assumes that they know so much more than me and I can't compete w that). 

So, with those toxic thoughts, here I am, peddling my way through these exams with the thought of 'im not gonna make it' and the cloud of 'its impossible, why try' surrounding me. I have tried so many ways to stop feeling inferior like this, but it keeps creeping on to me. I don't want to feel this way, I don't want to lose the battle before it has started, I just want to stop associating stats to where I might end up at, I don't want to be another number.

 Throughout these 2 years, I have stopped dreaming about a job/uni because it always seemed out of reach, but I am here, in a position where those things are in the line, yet I can't stop but think about how Im likely gonna not do well because of my schools stats.

84,SGExams,54979,[A Levels] Modern Day Competition,jqoxr1,tengyang_x,1604888313,43,1,"just some thoughts after years in an IP school. some context : i was in tripsci in y3-4, and somehow landed myself in one of the top few classes. y5-6, 4H2 PCME, and found myself in a class which often made it to the top in physics, chem and math.

and somehow, i got thrown to the very deep end of ""mugger culture"" and made very interesting discoveries. 

""I NV STUDY""
competition nowadays isn't ""bro i studied 12hrs yesterday wbu?"" but ""damn i NV study. i'm GONNA FAIL"" and post on insta abt how bad the paper was. we all know (too well) what results that bastard gets. and then comes the reverberating ""SAME"" from like 3/4 other people. 

it kind of pisses me off sometimes especially since i wasn't doing very well (rp 30+) at the start of this year even though i rly tried so hard while they all score so well. i was juggling a ton of events (literally had 2 performances &amp; 1 external VIA) and a truckload of stuff at the start of J2. it seems like nowadays, ""admired"" are those who don't study while people who study hard are looked down on. little credit is given for effort while not giving a damn about your studies is seen as desirable. the kind of encouragement &amp; teamwork for studies in my parents' days don't seem to exist. this sort of environment created by us is inherently toxic. and insanely painful for those finding themselves on the left side of the bell curve.  

""MUGGER la"" 
ain't this phrase commonplace as heck. calling people muggers for putting in their best. what's the intention of this? perhaps, an attempt to bring others down. perhaps, pushing others down to make yourself feel better for the 4 less papers you did. those who actually put in effort are not just FROWNED upon but they are actively shunned. society has evolved and attacks don't go like ""ew this guy is disgusting "" but go indirectly like ""this guy is a mugger"". society has evolved until our perception of studying has become something negative &amp; undesirable. but again, those who label others as muggers just go home and study their ass off, and bc they know they've studied, they don't study in school. that's competition right there. 

slowly i learnt to adapt to such a culture. was tough in y3-5 but got better in JC2. in feb or so i looked at my 38rp result slip and just wanted to kms &amp; called myself dumb and everyth. it's at that point in time i decided i needed to do SOMETHING cus this wasn't gg to work out. at the same time i made a decision to work towards getting into medicine in university, a course i always wanted but never thought i could reach it bc my grades were too trash. i don't believe that i was that dumb. so from then on i decided to work hard. ran into every single attack possible. ""why u study so hard"" ""don't mug alr leh"" ""go home then study la play game first"". chose to ignore all those and told them ""my grades too bad alr man i need study"" and continued. studied my ass of during CB, and took most of my recess times to do extra papers when we got back to school. it was legit tough to do so bc everyone would question why i worked so hard. i just said ""now alevel u don't mug u do what?"" and i knew deep down i only had one goal which i didn't tell many about cus it felt embarrassing to aim for smt like that. cus of that my grades saw a little improvement. jumped to 69 in myes, and managed to add another 12 in prelims. point of saying this is that it worked to ignore the comments. to all those drowning in society's pressures, try to ignore it. ditch the competition and toxicity and compare w yourself. ultimately you're making yourself happy. not the rest. if you really want smt, go for it and don't stop at anything cus we'll see who gets the last laugh! if no one does, let me admire you for your effort, and tell u that having perseverance is a quality in its own. no matter what your results are, be glad you did ur best. no regrets, keep ur head up son. 

such environments only make academics a lonely fight. it is no wonder many get anxiety attacks, cry in the middle of school and take anti-depressants to get by. bc school is tough, and a competitive environment just makes it worse. together with expectations from typical asian parents, it's a recipe for a mental (and physical) health disaster. count yourself lucky if you're doing well, but do have some empathy for those trying their best. 

till then, to all d haters i nv gave an answer to, i mugged bc bitch, i'm gonna make my dreams come true.

I’m from a middle-top tier sch and my prelims was ok with ABB/BC and most being 80-100percentile. I keep expecting better of myself and i become a bit too perfectionist doing my work, like constantly double checking to ensure i don’t make careless mistakes etc and this has cost me time. I fucked up chem prac gp and math so far and i’m honestly VVVV worried abt my grades in comparison to others. I know it’s a toxic mindset but i tend to see them as competitors and it kinda hurts me thinking that those who were originally performing worse than me are doing much better during papers compared to me. I’m really scared that i can’t get my desired grades AAA/AB and this has been clogging my mind persistently and i just cant help but keep worrying about my grades, those lost careless marks and questions left empty. 

And i know back during olvls even tho i was scared i was still confident but now that the stakes are higher i honestly just keep getting anxiety in the form of stomachache... and it really affects my performance but i can’t help but worry... what if i don’t get into my desired course ?? what if everyone else does better ?? what if i’m the only one severely underperforming?? i’m so worried abt when that day comes for us to collect results and i perform so much worse than all my peers....",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jn81it/a_levels_stress_anxiety_and_underperforming/,1.0,['Right you gotta know how to manage it .

i originally wanted to go to hcjc, but due to several mess ups in my papers i am very much certain that i am not going to make it there.

nyjc is the school that i currently really want to go to, but it seems like a very unrealistic goal for me right now. + the competition is very HHH

can any seniors who have attended any of these four jcs help me answer the following questions?

1. how is the academic rigour like? do people always mug? or are people closet muggers? or both? is the culture competitive? if so, to what extent?

2. are the biology, chemistry, math, economics &amp; geography department strong? if so, in what way? what about pw? what's the distinction rate out of a 100%?

3. are the people there nice? is the environment toxic? if so, in what way? are the students there very clique-y or? especially for ejc, are the ip girls very snake-y idk how to put it oops &amp; what about the teachers? are they supportive, or do they leave students to fend for themselves?

4. have there been any students who have successfully applied for &amp; been admitted into uk universities such as imperial college london, king's college london, university college london, cambridge or oxford? if so, to which courses? if not, what about other universities in the uk?

hello everyone! this is my first time posting and im kinda scared LOL anyways there’s something ive been wanting to address so bear w me and try giving this a read hahaha ~

Over the past two weeks, I have spent many hours on reddit reading responses towards examinations as well as how people are feeling. Most of the responses are negative and self doubting. Many have taken upon themselves to check their answers (same) and I've seen the toll of its impact on some of you. I have friends crying upon checking of answers and I also have friends boasting about how well they did. 

Regardless, I feel like no matter how badly or how well you did, you should always take it with a neutral and calm heart. Giving yourself false hope is pointless. Demoralising yourself is pointless. The exam has been done, what else can you do about it? Steal the papers? HA funny. There is simply nothing you can do but move forward. Maybe you really did so badly there is no hope for you. So???? What's the worst that could happen? ITE isn't so bad. Retaking isn't so bad. As long as you have the strength to continue, YOU WON THE BATTLE.

to those out there suffering. those considering self harm as a way to destress, why are you casting your mental health aside? you feel isolated? worthless? talk to someone. talk to your parents, talk to your friends, talk to strangers (be cautious) , anything is better than hurting yourself. better days are looking upon you and trust me, this isn't worth it. This. Isn't. Worth. It.

Yes, results are so detrimental to our society and I hate it too. But why are you devaluating your self worth based on numbers and words displayed on a piece of paper? RESULTS DO NOT DEFINE YOU. your results do not stop you from achieving your dreams. Your results either speeds up or slows down the journey. This is YOUR life, people can say what they want but this is your life. You call the shots and you experience these moments on another personal level. What your family say, your (toxic) friends say, does not matter. Everything is going to be okay. In case no one has told you, everything will be okay. The worst that could ever happen is you giving up. You can give up on toxic friendships, you can give up on impressing society, you can give up on diets. But, as long as you DON'T LOSE HEART, and don't give up on yourself, everything will be just right. :)

Pick yourself up. Start again. 
If you fail? 
Pick yourself up. Start again.

Your life is the constant variable, please stop letting your mental health deteriorate to the point of no return. You are so so so valued, it may not seem so right now but the sun will shine upon you again and everything WILL BE OKAY. 

I understand your panic, your worry but really, there is nothing you can do right now except to move forward. Accept what has been done and move on. Maybe you'll cry over it, throw a tantrum, eat a few pints of icecream, whatever. do whatever you need to make you happy. Life is way too short to just waste it on things you can't change. To those who have done well over the past few weeks , congratulations. Don't forget to thank the people around you who have helped you since the start, be it directly or indirectly. To those who haven't, itsokay, start again. I feel you. But really, as long as we don't give up on ourselves, the future is so bright and we will get there.

89,SGExams,53191,[rant] regret paying to join nyaa,jjmwmo,maladalaa,1603888552,4,1,"this thought has been running through for some time and after avoiding the thought for some time and trying to convince myself otherwise, I really feel like I've made the wrong decision and it's too late to backout since I've alr paid $17 to join.

Tbh i joined quite hastily because i was attracted by the 6 achievement points and how it'll boost your portfolio (I'm planning to apply to a local uni after) but i recently found out that there's no difference between the types of cca points soooo I feel like an idiot for not clearing up the misconception earlier. I admit that i only have myself to blame because i was distracted by my goal to get into a local uni aft poly (very geh kiang lol). The course I'm in is quite xiong and content heavy but i always thought that I'd be able to cope cuz i was given the impression that we'd be buddied w a senior but that wasn't the case at all 🤡. after i joined my schools nyaa cca, I was very confused abt what was going on, how and what components we had to complete by the ""deadline"" since we weren't very informed or updated regularly (opposite of what i expected) and that added to my stress 


Besides the ""portfolio"" aspect of it, I know that I am keen in being more active in helping out in the community. I can't say that I am extremely passionate abt it, neither can i say that I'm not passionate abt it so it is an awkward in between (idk how to explain this feeling well sry) I feel that I could have just volunteered individually in my own free time instead. 


Now one of the biggest regrets is not joining ambassadors instead. I knew it could boost my portfolio as well but i thought since it was quite ""common"", it may not have stood out as well. I initially had my sights set on joining ambassadors since I was very keen in helping out for open house, but I got peer pressured not to join since i was advised that the environment was toxic, but in the end those same ppl who advised me not to join, joined lol (hypocritical much 🙄); and my friends who are in ambassadors now says its actually quite a friendly environment so ig I'm the real idiot here for getting easily swayed by other's opinions 🥲. Even if i decide to join in y2, i won't be able to help out of open house since i heard its only open to y1 and y2s (before apr recruitment) but honestly I'm still wouldn't mind since its event based tho I know I would still feel like i missed out on a year full of opportunities to meet and network with more ppl in school, another reason why i was insistent on joining a cca. 


Now I feel like I've cornered myself into pushing through nyaa since i alr paid $17 for it and it'd be a waste of money if I chose not to continue. Idk man, I've been feeling so lost and regretful for a few months over this so any advice or encouragement on how I should approach this or be more optimistic would be greatly appreciated thankyou 🥺❤",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jjmwmo/rant_regret_paying_to_join_nyaa/,1.0,['Are you in TP?']

hi, my parents have always been pretty temperamental, especially my mother who is very stubborn and might be toxic. i grew up facing much mental and physical abuse from her and i am still in the process of getting over it. today she came into my room and asked for my exam schedule for o levels but i was doing my chemistry tys so i didnt have time to look for it. moreover she already had a copy on her phone. however she started her usual abuse (after secondary 3 its mostly verbal abuse) and started saying things like ""are you trying to retain???"" and ""you keep lying to me ever since u stepped into secondary school"" and wouldn't even listen to me even after i asked her to calm down. i know this might seem like normal nagging but i literally stsrted having a panic attack but i couldn't show it physically because shell get more agitated. today i woke up somewhat confident that i could do well for O levels and it took me a whole day to do that because im not sure of how i did for my tests the previous week and it made me less confident.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's some background info about me:

Am a dude who've just finished O's &amp; am really eyeing to go to a JC (Specifically, YIJC)

However, I'm rly a sotong &amp; just can't seem to decide on which subjects I take should take on as the subject combinations aren't as flexible &amp; I would like to know more about YIJC. (Including its flaws)

(Everyone knows that open houses &amp; school websites are usually propaganda &amp; only highlights the bright side of the school. Personal experiences from current students, alumni or teacher are much more reliable.)

&amp;#x200B;

Next, about my desired subject combi: H1 maths + H2 Chem, bio &amp; Malay

(I personally think that I've done very well for maths &amp; chem. I've already met the prerequisite for H2 Malay/Malay elective programme because my results for the June/July paper were excellent. A.Maths Errrr, can pass but most likely will get a C5 or B4 at most. That's why I think I'm not cut-out for H2 maths. Hence, the subject combi as I've typed above)

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, there 3 things that I want to be clear about.

1. How's the culture like in YIJC? Are there like closet muggers/people who pick on those who work hard/toxic people/People who are spiteful?
2. Are there like teachers who don't give a s\*\*\* about their students?
3. The subject combis in YIJC seem to be quite limited eh. Is it possible for me to take on my desired subject combi?? (Do I have to make an appeal or is it just downright not possible?) My priorities are H2 sciences (Not only chem) &amp; H2 Malay.

Sorry if I sound demanding after what you've just read. Ultimately, I made my mind to go to a JC instead of poly because the JC route is helpful for me to achieve my dream career in the future. Choosing the right JC &amp; most importantly the right subject combination are some of the crucial ingredients to reach this goal I really yearn for.

Also, sorry for the terrible English if it 'erodes' your eyes. The highest I've got for EL is only a B4. If any of you are grammar Nazis, you don't need to bother okay about my bad grammar or whatsoever.

If you've reached this far, thank you so much for sparing some time to skim through my woes &amp; any feedback/suggestions/insights/advice/personal experiences would be appreciated!! :)

&amp;#x200B;

\+++++++ All the best for those who are going to receive their N-lvl results on 17 Dec, O's in Jan &amp; A's in Feb! No matter how terrible the outcome is, just don't give up!! We're still young &amp; still have much to live for! National examinations are significant but the cert does not dictate our future. If yr results turn to be worse than you've expected, it doesn't mean that you'll have a bleak future unless if you're a couch potato 24/7 &amp; don't make the effort to do something about it!

Here is my answer to ur queries:\n\n1. There is a diversity of students in YIJC, muggers, toxic ppl, slackers. I feel that if you really want to excel in YIJC, you got to start your game immediately on Day 1. This school allowed me to enjoy myself while studying hard. Though the culture and unity of the school is not that strong, it was pretty enjoyable based on my experience.\n2. Not really. I mean there are such teachers everywhere. But for YIJC, there are many dedicated teachers who i was lucky to meet, and definitely helped me a lot to excel. So i think teachers isnt a concern for YIJC.\n3. Btw, YIJC is known to take in weird combis. I am a hybrid student that took h2 geog, h2 phy, h2 math and h1 history. No one is the cohort took my combi. So i think subject combi shouldnt be a problem too if your O Levels results are pretty decent overall.   \nBtw, try to take subjects that you are passionate about and can excel in. Dont conform to peer pressure to take popular combis that you are not confident about.']"
97,SGExams,63688,[rant] toxic parent or am i the toxic one ??,kaiwlo,goldenmiraclexx,1607619135,1,1,"hi im writing this post after much thought and time spent being mentally exhausted from my relationship with my mom. i really hope you guys can help me out ! ill try my best to sound as neutral and unbiased as possible. im sorry if this isn't the right place to post my thoughts. my relationship with my mom has been rather great until this year where things suddenly took a change for the worse :( maybe its because i was too stressed (j2 taking a's) and needed an outlet to vent my stress on but i started to find myself finding fault in everything my mom does. 

so lemme start. idk why but this year i suddenly became damn ocd and couldn't stand the way how the way things in my house were running. i told her and afterwards she got angry with my attitude towards her and started telling me my flaws. initially i was angry at her but after a while i did realise that some things i was doing wasn't right lah so i put in the effort to change and i eventually did do things the way she wanted. on the other hand she did not even listen to me and she did not change after so long. this has been ongoing for a few months and although i did give in after a few weeks from the beginning of the whole argument with my mom so we started talking again, but the whole ignoring each other started yet again after a's ended and we argued again because of this.

i did say some harsh words to her i admit, but i don't feel sorry enough to apologise to her because even after so so much thought i feel like all i said were the truth. i really resent her for so many things in my life i could write another essay on this but getting straight to the point she does not give me a lot of concern and attention compared to my friends. and because of this my siblings grew up to be absolute brats like not even joking they are seriously not good people. 

this whole year was just full of sadness, anger and stress i don't even know how to continue on anymore even though a's have ended and i should be happy and all that. yesterday, i sent her a sticker on whatsapp after us ignoring each other for weeks. mind you she does not even cook for me, she only cooks for my siblings lol? idk if im in the wrong for expecting her to cook for me but i felt q angry and that's that. back to the point, sending the sticker was my way of trying to reconcile with her.. but her reply was so rude okay. today, after i came back from eating dinner with my friends, she kinda tried talking to me! but before i could even feel grateful for this she started laughing out loud at how big my thighs and butt were......???? like .. what the actual fuck?? is this how you start a reconciliation?? to diss your own child? 

i was so angry i started crying because those are my biggest insecurities??? my whole life she would diss me every now and then about my big thighs and ass like does she think i will feel happy after hearing that. i couldn't take it anymore and i shouted at her to stop talking like that. in return she got so mad at me for being so sensitive and talking so rudely. haiz.

maybe this was her way of trying to reconcile with me. but i really couldn't take her insults anymore. so after our trials at reconciling with each other we are back to being angry and ignoring each other again. am i being too sensitive and unfilial ?? is she right to be treating me this way ?? am i in the wrong for trying to correct my own mom..??? 

thank you so much for reading my long write up haha pls comment down what are your honest thoughts on this!! if im in the wrong pls tell me okay i am more than ready and willing to change for the better :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kaiwlo/rant_toxic_parent_or_am_i_the_toxic_one/,1.0,['[deleted]']

100,SGExams,63511,[rant] My JC experience and post-A level thoughts.,k9o0ea,Gairu70,1607501593,45,1,"This post is probably going to contain some controversial views, I do not intend to sugarcoat anything. 

I finished my A levels a while ago and would like to express my views about this arduous 1.5(?) year journey. 

Here’s some background information about myself so that it’ll be easier to understand my position and point of view. Hopefully I don’t appear as an arrogant person trying to flex, though I could care less about my reputation in an online forum and some internet points. Alright, I’m basically your average mugger who scores good grades. For school exams, I have consistently scored A’s for my H2’s, though I flunked my mid years in J2 and got 2 B’s for them. You’d think that someone like me wouldn’t be suffering in JC, right? Well, all I can say to that is I wish that was the case. 


A levels has been the most I’ve ever been pushed. Yes, O levels is nothing compared to this. If A levels were a 10/10, O levels would be a 1. During my secondary school days, I was essentially wasting all my after-school time gaming and whatnot. In stark contrast, I found myself studying even after school during my JC years. During J1 and early J2, it wasn’t all that bad. I still had time to do stuff I wanted like go to the gym, play games, etc, though this was probably because I was doing well. I had breathing room, but it was unfortunately an ephemeral luxury. Remember when I said I flunked my midyears? Yeah. After that happened, I felt worthless as I had regressed so much and failed to get what I wanted despite putting in a tremendous amount of effort during the CB HBL period. It ended up taking up quite a toll on my mental health. I remember I flunked my GP so bad that I didn’t even want to look at my exam script and the marker’s comments out of sheer fear. It was debilitating, really. What’s worse is that a guy in my class literally told me this as I was checking my results. “It doesn’t matter that no one in our class got an A because in the end, I still beat you.” The competitive culture in Singapore’s education system is abhorrent, it really is. It never fails to rear its ugly head in every educational institute, and is even more prominent in JC where people are generally more study-oriented. It is sad to see that some people seek validation through scoring better than others, as if their own self-worth is derived from that. If you are that guy reading this, my sincerest “fuck you” to you. 


I am also well aware that there are people who struggle to pass and me saying that getting a B is underwhelming can be quite infuriating. This brings me to another topic. When I (and perhaps others in a similar position as me) say a specific grade is trash, it is based on my own expectations. Quite frankly, people need to stop assuming that if I am calling my B grade mediocre, I am calling everyone else’s B and below grades mediocre or worse. I’ve used this analogy once and I’ll use it again. An average student being upset that an A student failed to get his A is akin to an average powerlifter feeling vexed about Eddie hall complaining that he couldn’t deadlift 300kg. It’s absurd when you think about it. However, I do understand that it can feel like shit when someone goes around being depressed about a grade you yearn to achieve. But does that make their feelings invalid? No. If you’re going to say that I should be proud about getting a B, even though my (realistic) goal is getting an A, simply because getting a B to you is amazing, then I might as well say that your goal of getting a C is nothing to be proud of because “aye lmao I can get that with my eyes closed why are you even proud of something so easy to get lolololol.” Sounds pretty toxic, doesn’t it? People have their own goals, so please stop trying to extrapolate your goals onto others. “Good grades” don’t have a definitive shape and varies from individual to individual. 


Now I would like to talk about school exams. This may sound elitist, but in my view, school exam papers are very much harder than A level papers. Ask any student from an elite school and they would probably tell you that the easiest exam they have taken in their JC life would be A levels itself. Teachers have always claimed that school exams aren’t that much harder, if even at all. Why? Well, my best guess would be that they want to ensure that their students do not get complacent and rest on their laurels (assuming they have been doing well) or continue to work harder. The method is definitely efficacious, at least from my personal interactions with my friends and from what I’ve read online. Students seem unsatisfied with their school-based exam results and continue to strive to improve, perhaps because they are worried that they have failed to meet their expectations for a difficult paper. But at what cost? Just take a look around this subreddit and you’d find many posts about people being worried about their grades. The method of using fear to incentivise students to study is definitely good at improving their academic prowess, but can the same be said for their mental health? What is even worse is the way some Teachers address this issue. I personally know some Teachers who consistently urge students to study, and believe that more study = better grades. On the surface that does seem true, as it is intuitive, but the recipe for academic success does not only include working hard. Breaks are important too, we are not machines. My physics HOD has also blatantly called the entire cohort “not smart” at the start of the year due to poor cohort performance. During A levels, she has also emphasised competition, using phrases like “what makes you better than another candidate” to address the cohort. Is this the kind of unhealthy, competitive culture that we really want? Are we going to sacrifice every ounce of our mental well-being to attain good grades, get a good job, and be another statistic on Singapore’s GDP? I acknowledge that there is a need to push students in elite schools, but do we also have to breed such a toxic mindset while we do it? 


School exams being excessively hard also, in my opinion, serve as a means to segregate students in the school. In top schools, many students are able to get an A easily for A levels. RI, HCI, NYJC, VJC, etc. having such high distinction rates corroborates this. This essentially means that if the exams were to be set at A levels’ standard, many students would be deemed as equal due to achieving the same grade. By setting a much harder paper, those who are able to achieve A for that paper are able to be distinguished from those who cannot get A for that school paper but can get it for A levels. The result? Perhaps some elitism, segregation of students based on their academic prowess, and of course, the toxic competition which I have personally experienced. Again, it really isn’t good for mental health. 


I also think something worth noting about A levels is that it’s most likely going to obliterate whatever social life you have, at least if you’re the studious type. Personally, after around mid-J2, I started planning my activities with only one goal in mind: A levels. It would be a truism to say that I spent a lot, and almost all, of my free time studying but what is more interesting is that the other activities I did were all for the sake of studying as well. When I took breaks, I honestly didn’t do so for the sake of having fun. I did it because it would rejuvenate me to study even more. I knew I wasn’t a machine and I needed breaks to study effectively and to work towards my goal of A levels. I also snacked a lot, and it wasn’t because I was hungry. The food tasted good and made me feel more willing to study, more rejuvenated. Again, for A levels. I cut down on “ineffective” activities like gyming and socialising. Why? They achieved the same thing as gaming, snacking, watching videos, etc. but they took considerably much more time. This wasn’t a good way for me to achieve my goal because it was simply an inferior method of recreation. In essence, I sacrificed a lot of other parts of my life (health, social life, etc.) for the sake of A levels. Yes, it’s pretty pathetic and sad but I suppose it’s the consequence of a meritocratic society placing heavy emphasis on international examinations. After all, this isn’t poly or Uni where you have a GPA, you only have one bullet and you have to make your shot count. So much for holistic development, huh?


To wrap things up, my A levels experience had its ups and downs. I wouldn’t say it was the best experience, but it definitely wasn’t the worst. Many people struggled far more than me with their studies and I’m sure they’ve suffered more. But the point of this post is to say that, even as a “top” student, A levels wasn’t a breeze, to say the least. But if I could go back in time and redo my JAE, would I still go to JC? Of course. I came here because I liked studying and was interested in the content being taught. Hearing my poly friends speak about their group work experiences terrifies me, sounds like they’re doing PW 24/7. But I suppose that awaits me in uni.

I learn from my past experience that i should clarify and asked around whenever I have doubts.. and I did and people aren’t willing to help and you can see from the tone of the message that people aren’t willing to help.

Idk why but I feel frustrated at how things are, first of all I have a toxic classmate and I don’t have much people to turn to when I need help. And sometimes when I asked to just clarify something really minor people felt that it is something common sense to them/like why I am clarifying about it. 

like it’s like I just want to clarify my doubts and then not stereotyping that all elites students are like that, but some of them just like think highly of themselves and they think perhaps they understand the stuff and everyone should be have the same level of understanding.. 

I’m just so frustrated, so in the end I just suffer in silence.. then lecturers also aren’t helpful and not really willing to help.

poly culture? i could go on for 117 days without water.
to start off, a little background about myself: business student, 3rd year,in a local polytechnic. (sorry thats all about me) HAHA. To be objective, i have to admit that i am more to the introverted side but trust me that has nothing to do with anything. Why? 

point 2: group projects.
one IMPT fact here is that: talk more do less, you’re fine.
talk less do less: confirm get marked down. (honestly this is kinda deserved)
talk less do average amount: still get marked down.
talk less do more: also will get marked down.

conclusion: just talk a whole lot of nonsense and trust me, you’ll be safer than the dude who does work but keeps to himself.

point 3: peer evaluation
now, no generalisation intended. This is purely my experience. this is kinda linked to point 2 so here’s an elaboration. snakes are everywhere. literally. especially in my course (hint: probably the most boring course in biz sch) people don’t communicate. if they’re unhappy with you, personally or in terms of the project, they’ll put on their pretentious faces when facing you but give u a 1/5 for peer evaluation. what’s the worse, half the group is from one clique. that’s when you know, you’re pretty much f****. Peer evaluation honestly is one of the worst things ever implemented. It doesn’t promote communication at all. when dealt with a problem, people just mark each other down. in the end, this bias is brought on to all the other projects and TRUST ME, when you’re marked down once, there’s no end to it. (most likely) have you ever heard of the saying : 狗改不了吃屎。 yes this perfectly fits into this situation. Just let me ask you a simple question, if you have any issues with your fellow colleagues, are you going to ring up your boss every single time?or are you expecting the world to be fair. I’m not trying to condone free riders, what i’m trying to say here is, the peer evaluation is taken advantaged of. we are all 18-20 ish young adults, who may not have an objective judgement when it comes to evaluating the work of our teammates. Besides, would it hurt to communicate?

well i guess there’s no point 4. at least there’s nothing much i can say about the culture. to me, it’s just plain toxic. I might be biased, but everything i’m saying here is up for judgement. ultimately, it’s the big picture that matters, at least to me.

106,SGExams,60176,[Poly] NP School of Film and Media Studies AMA,k1y8uh,whyacheese,1606470116,24,1,"Hello! u/glittertap and I are students at Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP), from the diploma of Film, Sound &amp; Video (FSV) under the School of Film and Media Studies (FMS).

One year ago when we were thinking about our future, we noticed that there isn’t much info about FMS on here, so we wanted to do an AMA for you. We are happy to answer any questions you may have from FMS to NP, from HBL to CCAs, even Poly in general, so shoot away! There are no such things as stupid questions :)

More about us, we both got in through EAE, and this course was our first choice. We are both in FMS CCAs, u/glittertap is in FMS Agents (ambassadorial unit of FMS, think of it as a marketing version of Student Council) and I am in Stage 52 (events and theatre production). I am taking a Diploma Plus Certificate in French as a third language too! 

Here are some questions that we thought might be common:

# FMS Specific Questions

1. **Syllabus** In Polytechnic, your syllabus is split into modules. Every module is a different “subject”, though most skills and knowledge can be applied across all the different modules (at least for FMS). In FMS, your modules can be categorized into two aspects; artistic and theoretical, and technical. Moreover, all students in NP have to take 1-2 Interdisciplinary Studies (IS) Modules every semester. You will have 4-5 core modules in each semester, half will be artistic and theoretical, and the other technical. You will also have a module called Career &amp; Professional Preparation. For a more in-depth look into the FSV modules, check the NP page for more information: [https://www.np.edu.sg/fms/Pages/fsv.aspx](https://www.np.edu.sg/fms/Pages/fsv.aspx) 
2. **Timetable** Unlike secondary school where your lessons are shorter but more frequent (eg. 1 hour, 3 times a week), lessons in poly are longer but less frequent. For example, we usually have 3 or 4-hour tutorials at one shot, once a week. Here is our timetable for last semester if you’re curious: [https://imgur.com/a/4yQ0IDm](https://imgur.com/a/4yQ0IDm)
3. **Workload** There’s an inside joke in the school that FMS stands for Forever Missing Sleep. We will not comment on that. FMS courses are not academically heavy (eg. like JC or biomed), but can be very project-heavy since most of our grade comes from projects and assignments. It starts off easy the first two or three weeks but increases exponentially till the last day of the semester. Most students will handle each assignment as it comes, planning ahead is quite tough because a lot of it includes working in teams. The type of work is vastly different from module to module, so we will get into the specifics if you have any questions. 
4. **Assignments** The range of assignments is crazy. We will try to categorize them as best as we can. In general, you will have; Written quizzes, Skill tests, Workshops, Productions, Written Assignments, and Deliverables. We will elaborate on the assignments in the comments due to formatting issues.
5. **Weightage of assignments** It depends from module to module, but you usually will have many small assignments (weighing anywhere from 2.5% to 20% ) during the semester, and you will have a large final project at the end (around 30% to 40%). Luckily for FSV students, the teachers are usually very clear with the syllabus and the assignment weightage, and will usually brief the students ahead of time (either during the first week of the semester, and usually a reminder a week before the start of the project) so just check in with them, or download the syllabus document from the school portal (MeL). 
6. **Overseas Trips** Prior to the pandemic, FMS had an overseas trip each semester break. There will be an interview process and only selected students get to go. We do not have much information on this aspect, sorry.
7. **Relevant skills that you need to have in FSV?** You go to film school to learn about making films. You do not need to know any prior technical skill before coming into the course, just a burning passion will do you fine, the lecturers will guide you each step of the way. Though, to be honest, many students already have some technical skills under their belt, and some also have experience in the industry, but do not worry, everyone is there to help each other out.
8. **Are the exams demanding?** All the 3 diplomas in FMS don’t have final exams! We may have short quizzes or tests during the semester but we don’t have a big exam at the end. Most of our grade comes from assignments.
9. **Are the people in media courses really as toxic as the rumors claim?**  We were pretty blessed to get a good class (27 people) where almost everyone is decent and chill. There will definitely be toxic people whichever course you go to though, it’s just up to luck how many or how little end up in your class. Please try to be cordial with everyone though, it is important to keep friendly relations as you will be working together in the same class for three years, and teamwork is incredibly vital to filmmaking. There are even some modules where the entire class will be working together on the same graded project, so please be respectful of everyone. The media industry in Singapore is really small too, so try not to make enemies!
10. **For FSV, is it true that all costs relating to school projects need to come from students’ own pockets?** Sadly this is true. We had to pay $50 each for our location filmmaking final project, and we also heard that each person will have to fork out $3000 each for the FYP (final year project) in year 3. Most of us work part-time during the school term or vacations. However, don’t let this be an obstacle in your decision! There are many bursaries, financial aid, and scholarships that you can apply for, and the school will just transfer the money into your bank account without much hassle.

1. **What is Ngee Ann's school term like? Does it depend on your course?** Similar to Secondary School, the year is made up of 2 semesters and 4 terms. Semester 1 starts in mid-April and ends in late August, while Semester 2 starts in mid-October and ends in late February. There are 2-week breaks in the middle of each semester, between each term. There are also study &amp; examination weeks at the end of each semester, and the weekly classes will have finished by this period. Other courses will use this period to study and go for exams. However, since FMS does not have exams, we will use this period to work on and wrap up all our final projects for the semester.
2. **Does Ngee Ann offer extra credit?** Nope. You only have the modules that you are assigned. 
3. **What are the IS like?** Interdisciplinary Studies (IS) Modules are core modules that everyone in Ngee Ann has to take, regardless of your diploma. In Year 1, there is Innovation Made Possible (IMP), Health &amp; Wellness (HW), and Exploring Contemporary Issues (XPLORE). IMP is design thinking and students have to come up with a prototype of an invention that can help a chosen societal group. HW is like PE, we learn a bit of theory about physical and mental wellness, and you could also choose a sport to play before COVID was a thing. XPLORE is kind of like GP and you have to write reports and argumentative essays. You can check out the official IS website here: [https://www.np.edu.sg/is/Pages/Year1Modules.aspx](https://www.np.edu.sg/is/Pages/Year1Modules.aspx)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/k1y8uh/poly_np_school_of_film_and_media_studies_ama/,1.0,"['Elaboration on assignments:\n\n**Written quizzes** \\- It is what it is. In FSV they usually do not hold much weightage, so far we’ve encountered a 15% quiz, and an overall 25% quizzes ( 5% for pop quizzes, 20% for the final test.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Skill tests** \\- These are to test your technical skills. You will be in a controlled environment with the lecturer and a few other students. It is not open book (as far as we know). The lecturer will give you instructions and you will need to use the equipment accordingly. They will brief you on the rubrics as time comes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Workshops** \\- We have only encountered this in our Photography module so far. You will first have a lecture on the artistic concept for the week. Then, you’ll be given 90 minutes to take photos around the school and submit them by the end of the lesson. Each workshop is 10% of the module grade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Productions** \\-This is the big daddy of all assignments. It covers the entire production process (pre-production, production, post-production) and it takes up a good chunk of weightage. You will need to work in groups of 6-14 people to create a film, a television show, a music video, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Written Assignments** \\- This can range from written essays to paperwork. Usually around 10% to 25%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Deliverables** \\- Create a final product such as a video, a poster, a photo portfolio etc. We have only encountered this in our editing module so far. You will need to edit a short scene and submit the rough cut and final cut to the lecturer. They will mark it according to the rubrics given.']"
107,SGExams,59975,[rant] strict asian parents and views abt ITE and society,k1geoq,unbotheredllama,1606402002,20,1,"Hii, you’ve probably known what this post is going to be abt from the title. Asian parents, they always expect their children to excel in their studies so at the end of the day they hv smtg to boast abt to your relatives during cny, it’s all about their 面子(face). They have to understand that sometimes we really tried our best to do well, and instead of scolding us, saying that all we did was use our phones or play games when sometimes we really gave it our best shot, they should at least give us words of encouragement saying that we at least tried our best and it’s okay to fail. Who doesn’t fail their tests or exam at least once in their life? If they continue to place pressure on their children, the cycle of strict asian parents would just be repeated, ContiNuOusLy Maybe not for all, those that are being pressured by their parents now may not do the same to their future child because they obv know what it feels like, however some may do the same to their child as they would develop the exact same mindset of wanting their child to excel in their studies. This really has to stop, YES it is important to study well and get good grades, but not with a wrong mindset of forcing your child to study or over do it just for you to at least hv smtg to boast to your family or relatives. Regarding abt ITE, Asian parents are also mostly against the idea of it because of the fact that people with poor grades study there, ++ the fact that people who study there require to wear the uniforms there which makes the students feel so ashamed that they are in ITE when they are in public, maybe not for all. Not everyone is a genius, some just takes more time to complete their journey. Only if ITE allows the students there to wear home clothes as well, then students won’t feel ashamed to even walk in public without having a few pair of eyes looking at you just because of that darn uniform. I really hate the society in sg, looking down on people, the so much claimed “united nation”. Well it says so in our pledge, and so far that only happens during National Day. Yes, there will be competition in the real society but a toXIc society isn’t what we are looking for. At the end of the day, we are all the SAMEEE. No matter what race or religion, we all end up dying. Stop differentiating people, respect each other because god knows when karmas gonna be your best friend. 

There may be people who are gonna disagree with my views and thoughts but I just wanna put this out here, I’m certainly not able to please everyone with my thoughts, there are bound to be people disagreeing with me but whatever, no time for that shit. but pls pls remember that taking a longer route doesn’t ruin your future, yes it may make you feel demoralised because your friends may be way ahead of you, but at the end of the day, you must remember that you are studying for your own future and not for your friends.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/k1geoq/rant_strict_asian_parents_and_views_abt_ite_and/,1.0,['[removed]']

110,SGExams,11367,"[UNI] Comparison between NUS, NTU &amp; SMU Biz (+Interactive Pedagogy)",bbbe5q,shibaainuu,1554834147,23,37,"Hi all, been thinking a lot about which university for biz so I came up with a list of pros &amp; cons after reading threads/forums, attending OH etc
P.S. personally am considering between NUS &amp; SMU. 

SMU (pros)
- new, cool, comfy seminar rooms and group study rooms 
- smaller class sized = closer relationship with professor &amp; more interactive teaching style (tendency to fall asleep during class is lower lol)
- convenient due to central location 
- has one of the best career counsellors
- functions best as a biz sch &gt;&gt;&gt; employers have better impression of smu biz grads
- flexibility of double majors

(cons)
- higher sch fees 
- lacks hall life
- relatively more competitive/toxic culture
- harder to score bc of gpa grading system

anyways, I recently attended smu admission interview and am curious to know how the 3h seminar teaching style works in SMU biz sch/other faculties. Is it a mixture of lectures+tutorials+discussions? How does it work especially for accounting modules? Also, are there company visits (e.g. for NUS marketing module, students get to visit Facebook, Google, Innisfree etc)


NUS (pros)
- uni brand rep/ranking
- very happening with all the rc/hall life/nus flag n rag
- big, beautiful n vibrant campus with many food options (+cheaper)
- S/U option 
- flexibility of double majors

(cons) 
- longer travelling time (north-sider)
- your traditional lecs &amp; tuts

I heard there's sectionals (smth like smu interactive pedagody) in NUS. Any current  students care shedding some light to how it works? 

NTU (pros)
- 3 years fast track = start working earlier
- cheaper hall &amp; sch fees
- has a more laid back culture

(cons)
- can't do double majors 
- imo 3-year curriculum is kinda cramped = have to prioritise between exchange progs/OCSP vs internship opportunities 
- pulau ntu unless u stay nearby


That's that - would be great if current students or fresh grads of respective unis share their thoughts/experience/hearsay, thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/bbbe5q/uni_comparison_between_nus_ntu_smu_biz/,0.0,['I accepted NUS because I heard that it’s mostly seminars for accountancy']
111,SGExams,11170,[Uni] Mental Health vs Studies/Career,b9ezvx,throwmeintomed,1554395565,2,11,"I'm going into uni this year in a healthcare course and over the years I've suspected that I may have some mental health issues affecting my performance in sec sch and jc, even causing . Some examples of these are depression, anxiety (especially exams), ocd (worsens during exams) and some self-harm/suicidal thoughts from time to time.

I have never seen a psych before and never been diagnosed as my parents don't let me make my own decisions (they themselves are toxic) and they also stigmatize and joke about mental disorders.

I'd like to know if the uni will restrict my areas of practice if i seek a psych consultation from the university health centre, or see a counsellor? and how far do these restrictions? I do not want the whole cohort to know that I'm being exempted from something because I have a mental health issue.

Also, would my future employers (!!healthcare field!!) know about it if they look through my medical records from the uni health centre?

Lastly, will my parents be notified if I see a psych and get a diagnosis? I am not going to mention self harm and suicide, I just mainly want to seek help for the anxiety and ocd as they are affecting my life and might worsen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/b9ezvx/uni_mental_health_vs_studiescareer/,0.0,"[""No, companies will not have access to your medical profile, not are you required to declare previously diagnosed mental illnesses.

i was wondering if i should call NP/TP up and ask if i can still join the course they offered me (idk if it’s possible but)

dropped out of JC and appealed into these 3 polys and got accepted by all
SP - creative writing for TV and new media (1st choice)
NP - mass comm (2nd choice)
TP - psychology (1st choice)

i chose SP in the end bc at that time i had alr dropped out of JC and was practically schooless lmao and SP was the first one to get back to me so i took the offer in fear TP and NP won’t reply in time

i got a call from NP about a week later saying that i got rejected by psychology and would like to offer me mass comm which tbh i wasn’t exactly interested in and i didn’t like how NP doesn’t have an MRT near it unlike SP which is connected to dover but out of all the polys i like NP’s environment the best and all my friends from sec sch went there

i only heard from TP like 2 weeks ago lmaoo and i got offered psychology but i heard that you need to be good at math for this course as there’s a lot of stats to calculate? i rlly suck at science and math so i rejected TP even tho it’s the nearest poly to my house (15 mins drive) and plus i alr submitted all my forms to SP so i thought it would be q troublesome to withdraw and accept TP instead

i went to jc bc no poly course interested me at that time and even now it’s still the same i just applied for these courses as my parents didn’t rlly like the idea of me taking a gap year
i lowkey regret gg SP bc even tho out of the 3 courses i was offered it’s probably the one i prefer the most, i’m not exactly into it and i heard that SP’s MAD sch is damn toxic lol i just don’t want to experience sm shit again

115,SGExams,12458,[Uni] Advice on selection bet NUS and SMU needed!,bnmufm,animemakesright,1557649918,17,4,"Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

Created this reddit acc as I really need help to weigh both the cost and benefits of this! Tried searching around but there aren't many people in similar situations and did not have much quantitative evidence to go about (eg higher starting salary is often touted but no concrete details such as how much can one expect to earn fresh out of college).

&amp;#x200B;

**Context**

Was offered LKC scholarship at  SMU (Computer Science + Biz) while NUS offered me CS + USP (w/o scholarship).

&amp;#x200B;

**Dilemma**

SMU's scholarship would mean that there are more opportunities for growth and being in a scholars' circle, it could be good for networking. The scholarship also could help to motivate me to go above and beyond and also gives me the chance to have a fully paid double degree. The drawbacks are that the CS Course in SMU is new (thus needs time to be fine tuned), heard the GPA is hard to maintain (thereby having a chance of failing to meet the requirements to continue having the scholarship), and also SMU is less specialised in CS.

&amp;#x200B;

NUS offered me single CS degree + University Scholar Programme (USP) but no scholarship. Due to self-selection bias, the networking opportunity in USP is better in the sense that the ppl there are more likely the ones you'd find in the higher echelons of an MNC for example. The CS, though relatively harder and more competitive, is more technical and CAP system with a larger pool of students means that a person is more likely to be able to improve (larger sample size of \~1700ppl vs SMU's \~400 ppl) assuming he does his due diligence. Drawback is that it is highly competitive, might have relatively lesser opportunity to develop (because I'm not a scholar), and also more toxic culture (I'm more of the type to be interested in a project than the office politics).

&amp;#x200B;

**Plea for help**

Given this situation, how would one go about choosing his/her university? Input from current students and perhaps employers are greatly appreciated! For an employer, would you prefer an SMU ddp scholar or an NUS CS student but has been part of the USP. And for students currently in the system such as an NUS USP student but w no scholarship yet or an SMU LKC Scholar, what is your take on this?

&amp;#x200B;

Really sorry for the long post and I hope to hear from y'all!

116,SGExams,11909,[A Levels] An open letter to some my classmates,bgvmdu,throwaway126364748,1556117905,11,243,"Though you may never have faced failure or performed subpar before, despite putting in effort, please do not act like failing that one test is the end of your life or go around saying things like, “If I actually studied, I would have gotten full marks.” Stop holding grudges against people who perform better than you and spreading nasty rumours about them. Perhaps congratulating or even acknowledging other people’s achievements is hard for you but at least don’t devalue them, especially if you are not in a place to judge. Pretending to not listen in lectures and making it a point to flaunt it to everyone else is not your bloody badge of honour. If you don’t find the lecture useful because you learnt everything in tuition, by all means, don’t even come. The always an alternative, more productive use for that time, other than disturbing others by acting like a smart alec and spouting ignorant comments while they are struggling. Stop pressurising people into revealing their marks or going around comparing your score, especially when people are visibly not comfortable revealing their scores. This toxic culture of wanting to climb this invisible ranking of “intelligence” is frankly peeves me and several others, who want to focus on their personal growth and learn together rather than fight tooth and nail over numbers. I understand that competition is inevitable, but the lack of willingness to collaborate and the blatant apathy towards other people’s feelings and situation is infuriating. This toxic culture is so pervasive in people’s minds to the point where people are “afraid” of asking questions in class or consulting the teacher because they don’t want to be deemed as “dumb”, “academically weak” or “stupid” by you. This is evident from the long silences after the teacher asks if anyone wants him/her to explain a particular tutorial question or concept, which repeats for entire tutorials. Snidely commenting “How could they not understand this LOL?” after any time someone asks a question is frankly disgusting to me. Making fun of others ,who may not have the same resources as you and want to learn, is not ok. You have no idea how psychologically damaging this behaviour and culture is to us. Therefore, I urge you to be more considerate towards others so we can have a more conducive learning environment within our class.

121,SGExams,15959,[A-Levels] A rant about my school.,crw92l,boldcounselor,1566099148,54,430,"Okay so, I really need to vent about my school. This place has been one of the most toxic, unsafe and just plain horrible places that I've ever found myself in. There's so many things that I can bemoan about this place but I can mostly just separate it into three things:

**The Teachers**

The school has one of the worst track-records on hiring practices I've ever seen. I mainly have gripes with their process or lack-thereof of hiring suitable teachers and some of the veteran staff.

I'll just start off with a rant about my Chem tutor. So this guy basically always wears black for some god-unknown reason and it would actually be kinda funny if it wasn't for the fact that he has one of the worst RBFs I've ever seen, coupled with his horrible personality. There was one time I didn't know something and I asked him in class and he was like ""If you bothered opening your lecture notes you would have known."" and it's not like this is an isolated incident either. He seems to hate all of us who are somehow not as magically gifted at the subject as he is. Like seriously if there is one redeeming factor about him it would be the fact that even though he's an asshole to all of us, he's an asshole most to this jock douchebag in my class (i'll get into him later).

So that's the veteran staff part taken care of. This school seems to have like a rotating assembly of teachers. Your tutors are always rotated out after a damn short stint and I'm pretty sure I've never had a tutor who didn't skimp out on us after more than 7-8 months. The school also doesn't seem to have any sort of vetting procedures for hiring replacement tutors either. There was one time they hired this guy and like less than 3-4 months into the job the dude was bloody arrested and we had to scramble to make do because it was just before our CTs. They hired this other dude to replace him but holy shit, this guy was so bloody incompetent it wasn't even funny. I'm still fuming that they're making us pay so much to receive such shitty education.

**Selective Enforcement of Discipline**

This is real kicker IMO. I can handle shitty teachers because I can still self-study to some extent but the people here are just toxic af.

There's this rich kid whose dad is some high-up CEO or some shit. You would think that in reality people don't exactly fit into stereotypes that you see on Channel 8 but holy shit if this kid wasn't the walking stereotype of asshole richboy I would actually be surprised. I'm pretty sure he has dyed hair but for some reason the teachers just let him go?? like, what the hell?? if i come to school late for a while i get booked and they give me a conduct slip but when this little shit comes to school late they're like ""dont do it again"". furthermore this kid is somehow both elitist and racist at the same time. there was one time i saw him talking one of my classmates and he flat out called her a slur. who does that kind of shit?? he always tries to pick bones with us peasants who don't live in the bubble of privilege that he does and holy shit this kid is annoying af.

but at the same time right somehow i'm unlucky enough to also have the textbook definition of rowdy jock in my class as well. this guy is the captain of the rugby team but he causes so much fucking mayhem and trouble wherever he goes but the fucking teachers and principal appears to adore him and always overlooks the shit he pulls. there was one time this kid literally caused the entire toilet to flood when he was up to his antics and i'm pretty sure he didn't get detention or any shit from it. then the other time like he came to school in his friend's car (neither of them have fucking driving licenses) AND HE CRASHED THE CAR INTO THE TREE IN THE CAR PARK. but again, guess what! nothing happened to him!

I’m neither an O or A Level student— I’m actually studying overseas after leaving SG after O levels. 

I’m just curious about what you guys think of the social environment in JC and whether you guys feel happy/satisfied/fulfilled when it comes to your social life and friendships with other schoolmates. I’m asking this because I have quite a number of friends/classmates who went to JC after O level, and from what I’m hearing, some people in JC can be really toxic. Things such as friends/classmates become so competitive that they go out of their way to do things (which I won’t mention here) make sure that others fail their tests or exams, quite a bit of backstabbing here and there sometimes. Also, I’ve heard and seen quite a number of posts here on this subreddit regarding social exclusion in JC. Is it true that this happens a lot in JC?

story time:
the entire 4 years of secondary school, i never really had a good group of friends. we were always fighting and it’s like round robin, one of us would get everyone else mad and we wouldn’t talk to them and then we’d reconcile and smth would happen and the next person would get everyone else mad and so on.
it was so sO toxic, now i know
so i left them to go find a different group of friends at the start of sec 4
risky yes, i thought i’d be a loner bc in sec 4 everyone already is in their cliques
but i managed to find a nice group of people and trust me they were very welcoming and even listened to my situation with the old toxic group.
but as expected i was a bit behind on all their convos bc they had inside jokes and stuff and i didn’t want to overstep any boundaries and ask them “oh what’s that” bc i was already very grateful that i was able to hang out with them
this is so not me, i’m a very outspoken person and i like to make people laugh even though my jokes may be lame but ‘getting judged’ has never hindered me... until now.

so my question is, will i be able to find quirky, crackhead group of friends in jc? or should i be prepared to dwell in my loneliness again? i really am a lively person, i want to bring that side of me out but i don’t want to be judged yk? how accepting is the community in JCs??",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/dtr87q/post_exam_afraid_about_not_being_able_to_make/,0.0,"[""hi I'm from vjc. would say that during orientation, there is the ip jae segregation because ip students have 1 month initiation. so naturally at the start of jc, ip kids are very Close to their initiation groups, rather orientation groups. but as lessons start and you get allocated into your classes, I don't see much gap between Jae and ip. (for my class at least, there is much integration between ip and jae. but I heard in some classes there is an ip clique and jae clique). you are a lively person, that's good and that will help you to find new friends more easily. I'm a j2, I find that cliques are quite stagnant now, so your cliques usually form in the first few weeks of j1. generally, people in vjc quite open and approachable. if you go to vj, I'm sure you can find friends. don't dwell in loneliness please.""]"
126,SGExams,23020,[O Levels] Success story: For secondary 3 students,dqw4tw,Nottavaliablee,1572757567,18,151,"Now is the O levels, and the end of your EOY. It's okay, you still have one year. What you scored now does not matter. Only what you score during O level does. Ingrain that in your brain.

When I moved up to secondary 3, I got quite a shock. Everything I used to breeze past suddenly became difficult. For the first time in my life, I failed literature. I was also at the bottom of the class, 4th last in class to be exact(because for some reason my class had 3 slackers who did not bother studying at all). What a huge blow to my ego. Did not help that I had major anxiety issues so I pretty much got outcasted in class as well. Also I had just one friend in class, a pretty toxic one, and that pretty much worsened my mental state. So to be honest the odds were stacked against me cus it's always better to study without all the unnecessary mental burden you know?

To give you an illustration, I failed 5 subjects in MYE in sec 3. 2F9s, 1E8 and 2D7s. 5 out of 8 subjects, and 2 of the ones I passed were languages which did not involve as much studying. I'm not going to put an image of my report card here for privacy reasons.

To give you background info, I have an older sibling that was in a top school, and since I already failed to do so in PSLE, I was considered the black sheep of the family. My parents would proudly tell people about my sibling but when it came to me...well...so I had immense pressure to do well in O levels. Most students who end up going good jcs were good from the start, and move very consistently. But nope, I am not like that. Started from the bottom, moved upwards and at the end, I obtained the O level raw score of 8. Here's how I did it.

The most important thing is mindset and discipline. My discipline has never been good, but my mindset made up for it. O levels was consistently stuck in my mind, and so were my bad grades. It's not to discourage yourself, mind you. It's to force yourself to kick out that fail from your report card and put in a nice grade there instead. I will always be in love with Youtube videos but I'll force myself in the middle of a very mesmerizing video to start studying. So instead of 'I'm going to start studying after this video', say 'screw this video O levels are more important'. Don't forget to let yourself take a break though. I had a mental breakdown after forcing myself too hard and you'd wanna avoid that. Also I never stopped watching anime. Week after week I would catch my episodes. Many of my friends stopped watching completely, but relieving yourself of the stress is very very very important. I know many people will say 'once I start watching I can't stop'. My strategy is to watch one of the new releases. So every week only one new episode is released to the public, and you can't go further than the newest episode. Perfect.

Also make full use of your TYS. Can never stress that enough. Finish all 10 papers of TYS for science and maths!

When making notes, don't stupidly dump everything in. Keep your notes as concise as possible. Be very selective of the info that goes into your notes.

I often get bored when studying, and when you feel that change subjects. It helps. I'm serious.

**Math(Both A Math and E Math)**

Math...math is all about practice. It sucks but that's how it is. Never be afraid to ask questions either, in class or during consultations. Do your TYS, move on to other school papers and ALWAYS do your homework. You don't have to redo papers like some teachers suggest, but make sure to review questions you did not get right. O level Math papers tend to be very repetitive with their questions, so the more you do the more prepared you are.

**Biology**

So I was failing bio up till sec 4 MYE, it was then that I realised I had to do something. Desperately. I took drastic measures. Honestly I hate memorising to a violent degree which is why I have always avoided it. How did I memorise 21 bio chapters in half a year while bringing up my grades for all my other 8 subjects? I started the habit of bringing bio notes wherever I went. I looked through them in bus stops, during breaks in school and stuff like that. Also I hate memorising so I made a compromise to myself: memorise each notes just once. Don't bother after that. To make up for it though, you have to reread notes very regularly. And I mean very very regularly. Reread them whenever you can. After that do your TYS and practice questions to strengthen your phrasing. Don't bother with making notes, there's too much content. At most draw pictures of certain diagrams.

**Chemistry**

This is the only subject I finished making notes for. So yeah notes are important. Use these notes while doing your TYS and many things you will remember automatically after practicing so much. It's all about practice. Also make sure to clarify your doubts that is very important!

**Combined humanities(SS, history)**

For SS, don't bother with the textbook except for the evidences. My teacher would go through each chapter and tell us which evidences to highlight. Do that. Memorise those evidences, very important! For the phrasing(for section B), memorise the answer key instead. They are much more concise than the textbook. Also study the answer key. For Source based, there's no need to memorise the answers, but study their structure. Pick up patterns in the way each question is answered. Also practice is very important.

History alot of stuff to memorise, but make sure you prioritise the source based chapters. Super important! The rest is the same as SS

**Literature**

Annotate your texts. Always make sure to take notes in class. My teacher did a lot of strange things to help us understand better, but they're useful so pay attention. Also receive constructive criticism from your teacher and practice writing essays whenever you can.

The only subjects I cannot give advice on are the subjects I did not take but I'm sure they use similar study methods la, so can still consider the methods listed here. About languages, I started cultivating a habit of reading whenever I can and picking up big words along the way. Also make sure to observe sentence structures and stuff like that.

(i got lucky during prelims and got a B3 because i did well in practical)

today's paper was abit difficult for me,  there are parts where i couldn't understand what they were asking for and didn't know how to answer the questions so i basically rephrased the question and put it back into the answer, and i probably smoked my way through more than half the paper. i had a minor panic attack halfway throughout the paper because i was really worried i couldn't finish the whole thing in time, and blanked out. 

coming out of the exam hall was worse. many of my friends who have always excelled in chemistry were already discussing their answers and saying ""the paper was so easy, oh i confirm already A1, A1 already"". and to me, who found the paper somewhat tricky, i already felt as if i was halfway to failing because of the moderation. (i've also been super triggered by those who flex about chemistry, like am i the only one that thinks chemistry makes no absolute sense whatever and only takes it because it's compulsory?) 


i realised i can't solely count on MCQ because i've always been getting an average of 28 or 29 out of 40, and i cannot move up to the 30s range however hard i try. (any tips btw)

Looking for advice! Thanks :)

&lt;Full Post Below&gt; 

Hello :) To give some context about myself, I'm a first-year in JC and I'll be repeating the year next year. In short, what happened to me is I fell very sick and as a result this year - I dropped out my Project Work (PW) and I didn't take my End-Of-Year promotional examinations as well. 

No choice, have to retain lor. Haha. I know this question might seem dumb, and I might get judged for it because ""retain jiu retain lor, is okay one what just mind your own business and study then can get into uni"" but IDK, I've been thinking along the lines of how JC curriculum is not the right fit for me? Idk also.

I've not personally gone through poly life, but my interpretation of poly life is that it is more fun than JC? Like ofc that's not the only reason I want go poly lah, okay or maybe it is LOL, I can't handle the 2 year intensive cramming marathon for A Levels that kind of thing. Is like quite cancer for me and I don't like it? Everyone is entitled to their own opinions so don't shoot me lah hor. I'm naturally someone more inclined to play and more dumb (not academically inclined lah) so I not sure how I ended in JC also lolol but I a bit regret lor.

But I consult a few figures in my life, and they were like just stay in JC leh. Like they say stay in JC more practical also, like in terms of getting into Uni. Then because if I want go Poly, I want go study Psychology hahah I guess in NP lor. Which I might not even get in bc my COP quite shit lor but my backup plan was Business related de in SP? But anyway my friend was like telling me for Psychology, like generally for humanities subjects like very volatile unlike Science got an obvious answer, so in that sense is quite hard to get a high GPA. Is like you never see a humanities student with GPA 4.0 one while for Math&amp;Science kind of course got a lot GPA 4.0s. 

So ya lor... if GPA low, cannot get into uni also. Then I want aim to get into uni mah. I not sure if my thinking is correct or not (my parents always say) uni degree is very important. I think usually the certificate set the starting pay of most jobs? Ya. So I quite scared. Usually stay in JC is safer route to get into Uni. Then for Business right, my friend say quite competitive (I think in Psychology also lah) then ya I just cua tio lor. Idk what to do hahah. Like go for Poly, which is what I want bc my personality suit Poly life more (idk I see the aspects of freestyle studying I just feel quite happy) or I just stay in my JC and like grow a thicker skin, go through the 2 years and go to Uni? I'm someone with quite thin skin lah, I don't think my heart can take it when I've to retain lah, is very hard to explain this one. Just ego matters lol. If I go Poly, is like fresh start to some extent also because I feel my current JC life quite toxic, the environment. Idk leh. Any sort of advice will be appreciated lah.

I would like to share my exp when I was having my depression for 6mths - 12 mths 

tbh I already feel something was wrong when I fail my O level and went ITE. I just ignore it.  the breaking point was I so worried and push myself so hard so that I can go poly then I just breakdown and cry. maybe I felt alone because was in the wrong and toxic clique sia

that ep was rather quite down for me. having depression is like everyday you ask yourself why are you living and why don't I die. I was very lucky I have strong support from my family and my ITE teacher. and follow the doctor advise that to pass 1 day by 1 day

fast forward now it is about 8-9 years since I recovered and there is no relapse for now even there is one time almost (I face a terrible ep when my ex gf and I break up during my NS time) that feeling is like my ex gf spend finish my money (3k-4k) my ex say I useless and also she open her leg for other guy while I in camp.

sharing this exp is creating awareness that  if you really feel something is wrong. just seek help. is okay to seek help! is okay to feel sad sometime. dun be like me back then let the negative cycle go in bigger circle and eventually run out of control.

I genuinely need and am curious about your opinion on my situation. I would like to hear unbiased opinions other than my friend's, which hopefully will be helpful for my own consideration :)

So a bit of background. I am a foreigner (S Pass holder), been here for almost 5 years (3 years as a student and 1.5 years working). I'm currently working in arts and design industry. As the title said... I have been considering about resigning from my job.  

I know, it sounds crazy. People are getting laid off here and there and here's me, wanting to resign despite being very privileged to be able to keep my job. This is because of the toxic environment (micromanagement, lots of blame game, messed up management system, and toxic higher-ups and boss). These reasons are also why the turnover rate is very, very high in my company. I have been wanting to quit since the first month I joined, but I am currently tied to a 3-year contract with the government for studies grant, so I kept telling myself to hold out for a year at least.

On one side, I am very grateful to still be able to work, but on the other hand I am not coping with it well mentally. Especially these past few months, the burnout has been getting way worse, and the fact that I have to deal with lots of unnecessary shit with my boss due to his paranoid nature isnt helping at all. I know no job comes easy, the work itself, despite being challenging, I do not mind. But I have held out long enough in my opinion, and I am very sick of having to deal with such toxic people. I have reached my limit.

But with the current situation, I am fully aware that this is not the best time, and it makes me feel guilty. If I end up resigning, I will have to leave Singapore and go back to my home country, which I personally do not mind as I have been homesick for a long time. I also have enough savings to get by, luckily. It's just that now my dad's business is not going well either due to covid, and it just makes me feel even more guilty if I go home jobless. :(
I really have to choose between financial and mental health.

What would you do if you were in my shoes? (anw thanks for taking your time reading this longass text!)

1,singapore,228546,Stressed out by my dysfunctional family. Need help urgently.,g0jpu4,throwaway661100,1586787222,79,224,"tldr: Year 1 uni student here. I stay on campus during the school term and have recently moved back. It's day 2 of moving back and I'm already breaking down because of my family. Need help.

My paternal grandma lives with us and my mother hates her. Their tension goes way back probably like 2 decades ago. So I grew up kinda walking on eggshells. I started disliking my mother in pri sch because I thought she was very negligent of me -- she never once asked about my studies and I was envious of my friends who had mothers who were so involved in their lives. Growing up we talked less and less.

I don't even know how to begin explaining this situation but I'll try:

The only person in this family who is on ok terms with my mother is my younger bro. I'm extremely convinced my mother has deeply toxic traits. She is very particular abt house cleanliness and would tell me to tell my grandma (my bro and I are always middlemen) to keep the kitchen clean and wash the hood every!time! she cooks. Whenever I try to reason with her she will DEFINITELY flare up and always always dredge up the past, launch ad hominem attacks on me (like why do you always show me attitude I am your mother) that have no relevance to the matter, and refuse to listen to any logic or to resolve whatever I tried to bring up. Quarrels like these always end in both of us crying so over the years I've learnt to keep quiet as much as possible and to turn a blind eye to the things she does. But I notice that this has unknowingly inflicted a lot of psychological trauma on me. Whenever she returns home from work I would hear the keys and my chest would tighten. A few times I would dream of her and wake up crying.

Part of the reason why I chose to stay on campus in uni is because it's like out of sight out of mind. But here's the big problem: for as long as my mother stays at home with the rest of my family, it's awfully painful to watch. A few weeks ago my father wanted to bring us out to celebrate my bro's bday, and my grandma decided to stay home at the very last minute when she learnt that my mother was gonna meet us there at dinner. Later at night my bro cried and confided in me that he was extremely tired. My father has stopped talking to my mother long ago and they sleep separately, and I know the emotional toll it has on him.

The one I feel the worst for though, is my grandma. She took care of me all my life and it sucks to see her live in fear of my mother every day. She has already changed her ways of cooking to use less oil (we moved house 2 years ago which was when my mother's crazy kitchen cleanliness expectations began) &amp; stopped frying things altogether. Now with COVID and everybody staying home, my grandma literally stays in the room all day to avoid my mother. So here's what I did. My mother was watching TV and my grandma usually watches channel 8 shows at night. So from my room, I texted her asking whether she could let my grandma watch TV at 9pm. Simple and straightforward request right? And guess what, she immediately went on a spiel on how my grandma literally does nothing except sits in her room all day and how she must have spoken badly of her behind her back. So I clarified that she hides in her room because she's fearful (to which she asked why would my grandma be if she has done nothing wrong like biiiitch) and I requested the TV on my own accord not because my grandma was somehow bitching about anything. \*more ad hominem attacks\* No TV.

It hurts. It hurts so much. Idk why I am so easily affected by my mother's words. We barely talk but when we do it always sends me down a thought spiral and makes me cry. So here I am, typing this out, teary-eyed with nowhere to go because of COVID and no privacy to let it out or call somebody because everyone is at home. I don't want the rest of my family to know I'm upset because this is additional emotional labour on them -- they are also tired this family dynamic.

It's only my 2nd day home and I'm moving back to campus in Aug. I feel like I cannot go on anymore. I'm tired of walking on eggshells and having all these crazy shit bog me down and distracting me from studying. I'm posting this on this subreddit because idk where else to turn to for help. I need both short and long term advice. Short term: I definitely need therapy to work out years and years of damage, and judging by my reaction today I need it urgently. I know of generic helplines I can call but it'll be nice if someone (with experience) can direct me to something useful and specific. Cost is a concern since I'm just a uni student and I'm funding this on my own. Long term: What do I do with a toxic family? It seems like the tension between my mother and grandma cannot be resolved and I've come to a point of acceptance already (my bro hasn't though). If I could move out right now and cut ties with her I totally would but the thing is, the rest of my loved ones will continue to suffer in the house. This thought bogs me down every day because it's one thing to be in pain yourself but it's even more painful to see your loved ones hurting. It's much more complicated if the toxic person is your family member not a friend or a partner. So to anyone out there who has grown up with a toxic parent, please share.

Well it has been 1.5h since the whole episode started and I lowkey regret sending the message to make my grandma a little happier. I'm still crying and I hate that I'm like this. My mother is literally incapable of proper reasoning and jumps to her defenses SO FAST. Idk how to leave the room and face her now. I'm already dealing with anxiety issues and there's this. I'm fucking tired.

Edit: Some of you have pointed out that I should involve my father in this. During a fight between my mother and I last year he told me that when push comes to shove one day, he will get a divorce, though that is really the last resort, especially since my bro will be caught in the middle. My bro feels some obligation towards her because he's like the only family member she talks to and worries that she'll do something stupid if someone were to raise divorce.

2,singapore,227075,I hide out at my boyfriend’s place most days because my home environment is toxic. The new bill passed today will drive me to the edge.,fx8dn0,MourningBacon,1586359436,75,1,"Note: Friend’s using my account to post.

To cut it short, I live in a household where arguments, physical fights, shouts, screams, and general abusive behaviour occurs on a weekly basis. This has happened since I was a child, causing me to now develop severe depression, anxiety. I also had to stop going for therapy what with the lock down and also stopped taking antidepressants because my family’s overall income got cut and I wanted to save us some money (Psychiatrists and antidepressants are expensive)

The only thing that kept me going was meeting friends and my boyfriend throughout the week. I stopped meeting my friends since weeks ago, but still went over to my boyfriend’s often. He’s an American that lives with another roommate in a 3 bedroom apartment 15 mins away from me. I usually drive my own car and go straight into his house. I then spend the rest of the day there and then go home late at night when most of the family’s asleep. 

Now that we’re not allowed to go out for anything non-essential, I feel that my lifeline has just been cut. My mental health issues stem from this household and being unable to escape somewhere for an indefinite period of time will literally drive me to the edge. I cannot just wander around a park for the whole day. I’m scared for what’s going to happen to me. I’ve seen a sentence or two that mentions that officers will be rational and understanding for certain situations, but it’s hard to explain this without making it seem like an excuse to see a boyfriend. It’s more than that — it’s a safe house.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fx8dn0/i_hide_out_at_my_boyfriends_place_most_days/,0.0,['Will you be able to move in with him in this period?']
3,singapore,227030,"I committed suicide but survived, here's what I learnt",fx5v1f,GramTooNoob,1586350032,232,1,"*(Warning, Long Summary)* It was a surprisingly tough decision, I cried every time I wanted to do it and asked ""Why me? What did I do to deserve this?"" But at the same time, I felt guilty for not going thru with it despite my suicidal talks. I don't want to be an attention seeker, that was not the goal. I wanted to ease the pain of loneliness but it only led to more misunderstanding of the person I am. Also, I would like to thank the kind person here who reported me to the police sometime in late 2019 after chatting with me on WhatsApp. That move, made it very hard for me to back down afterwards... which ended up reinforcing why I needed to go. I'm a man of my words, I can't back down now. And that time was finally here, and I committed suicide on 23rd March 2020, 1pm Singapore time.

I posted a farewell note right before I went thru with it. Looking at it now, it seems nobody cared  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fnfc2m/i\_write\_here\_my\_farewell\_note/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fnfc2m/i_write_here_my_farewell_note/)

**Timeline of events that followed**

* 1pm Overdose of planned toxic substance, 8 times or more the lethal amount
* 15\~30 mins later, body begun violently vomiting. Locked myself in toliet
* 4pm, plan seems to have gone wrong. No planned heart attack. Wanted to call ambulance, but I was determined to go through. Or somehow stable down before someone comes home, so I can treat it as nothing happened.
* 7pm, still conscious and blood in vomit. Family returned, but tried to get me to unlock the door. 8pm, I finally gave in and open it with my last strength. Didn't want to go GP cause I know its helpless but didn't want to say I committed suicide, so I said nothing. Ambulance arrived and somehow everyone thinks I had food poisoning from pizza the night before. Actually, that was my last meal. I just wanted to have one with the family before I go thru with the plan.
* 1am already, medications given somehow made the body super cold with non stop shivering. Sent to special observation area, waiting for a bed. While being pumped with potassium IV drip cause electrolytes from blood test were all messed up. This IV drip hurts like fk, like you stabbed your hand with a pen. Doctors seems confused, so I confessed. It's time to save me if I can't die. I thought they would pump my stomach but they seems clueless at what I was asking. Given more drip, and another new vomit bag cause the retching  wouldn't stop. Stomach seems empty at this point but I can still taste the toxic substance in my saliva and the body was rejecting it hard. One staff told another staff. ""I googled it but seems nothing much, I guess we just keep hydrating him then."" At this moment, I wondered if I should have asked to go SGH instead of CGH. Also, was given a catheter in my dick cause I could not pee into the urinal. Lots of brown urine started flowing out, bag filled fast.
* 10am, still no hope. More IV drip for hydration and vomit medication injected through some plug in the hand. Still vomiting an empty stomach and spitting saliva out, no sleep through the night. The stuff I took had an energy effect and it was keeping me super awake despite my body feeling like it desperately needs a sleep. Could not lie down, instant vomit feel. Have to sit out and try to force out whatever I was trying to vomit from my empty stomach. I could feel something but somehow could not vomit out from  a sitting angle. Asked to go to the toilet to vomit but was rejected due to fall risk. Asked to see doctor, that I feel I have a stomach in my hole. No doctor came, and passing doctors just say they are not my doctor. Finally someone looked at me but his not my doctor? He checked my stomach for fluid then left... that's it. I thought I was dead. Asked for Charcoal pill but was kept waiting. Pressed bed bell but no nurse would come. Well, they did eventually but very long wait. Telemetry device was tapped to my body, I learnt later that this connects wireless to the ICU. But this device is funny, they keep having to change battery cause it keeps losing connection and wouldn't turn on.
* 4pm, I think? No sleep yet. Still retching and more new vomit bags. Wiping with tissue paper at this point had cause the skin on nose, the lip and around it to peel with dryness. No choice, have to keep wiping still. The nose was filling with mucus, I had to clear it so I can breath. But finally breathing difficulty set in and they gave me oxygen. But BP machine shows oxygen at 100%.
* 9pm, nurses shift my bed to another area in front of the nurse counter so they could monitor me. Now I feel bad for the patients there, cause I'm still splitting saliva and retching into my vomit bag every 3\~5 mins. Throat at this time was sore, and there were some blood in my spit. Nobody cared when I told them, and I haven't seen any doctor. More IV drips and vomiting medicine injected through the plug in my hand.

**Fast Forward, the serious moment**

* 25th March, I have finally seen the doctor for the first time, I think? Pretty Chinese Female. Was told I'm given 2 very powerful medication already but my body is reacting severely to what I ovedosed on. The psychiatrist wanted to talk but I was vomitting/retching. Been like this, non-stop since admission. Still on IV drip, with plugs on both hands now. My elbow skin had peeled from holding the vomit bag non-stop and rubbing against the blanket. It hurts. No sleep yet, since the suicide. Was placed on adult diaper caused I shitted in my pants, bowel control seems lost at this point.
* Late afternoon, seems to have choked on the charcoal pill in my throat. Stuck feeling but warm water didn't seems to help and I was not allowed to eat or drink cause I was still retching. Relative who visited said my throat was swollen that's likely why I feel something. No need to take x-ray.  Not really convinced but whatever. Everything was so uncomfortable. Even the breathing tube, I removed it multiple times cause it was blowing wind into my stomach? 
* I begun losing control of my limbs, only have control of 1 and a half hand? Have to will myself, eyes started doing random stuff like raising the eyebrows one by one, legs were moving up and down by itself. Doctor visited in evening, and I said I am having some random bout of OCD. That the body didn't feel like it was mine anymore. Not very sure what doctor said, but I think I was given another (third?) powerful drug for the vomiting. All I can remember at this point was, they have taken tons of blood and poked me many times cause they keep failing to draw the blood, cause it keeps drying out. Sometime at 10pm, I begun losing consciousness. I wanted to sleep and I could feel like I could finally get some sleep in such a long time, but there was a voice in my head. Someone in my voice was talking to me directly, but I am not sure why I referred to it as the devil. (I'm a free thinker) But it was laughing at me for not treasuring my life and now its going to take over it and give it back when its done. It was running crazy suggestions through my mind like throwing my diaper to the window and screaming ""Covid19 HAHAHA!"" then trying to have sex with the nurse, and the cars in the distant carpark which I can see through the window was somehow also sexualised. It's like the horny side of me which I have suppressed all the time was breaking through and this side is now taking over. I dare not sleep, the voice said and I knew that if I sleep, it could take over and ruin my life. I did not want to wake up tied down or sent to jail. I even had the though for taking the respirator off the patient in my opposite bed. Started sticking tongue out, licking randomly as if I was licking \*cough\* a girl. I dunno why, it's just like this, then I begun bitting my tongue as if trying to bite it off. Tried stopping it while keeping awake but ultimately lost, and lost conscious.
* 2am, next day. I woke up in some sort of stroke mode. Repeating words like where I am, what is this, who am I, then forcing myself to shut up so I don't disturb others and that I need to shut up so I can sleep. I need to sleep, I told myself. Went in and out of this state a few times, then finally went into a vegetable state. Strange feeling of being stuck in the body, unable to move and filled with all kind of ridiculously sex thoughts. I think I was ejaculating into the urinal bag at this time, I'm not too sure. I used my last strength to tell the nurse to please kill me, I don't know what is wrong with my body. I can sign, I sign well, please burn me. Let me die and I just keep repeating something like this. I didn't want to be stuck in a vegetable mode. My whole mind was fked at this time with sex sex sex. I couldn't move, I didn't know if I can die, I prayed to the lord to save me, take me away. I can't do anything. I needed to die. I hoped that necrosis set in and finally set in. Somehow I could still think from a 3rd person perspective. Then I died. It was just like sleep, I didn't feel anything... I was just gone. Gone, no pain... no nothing. Just gone.
* 10am, 26th March morning, I woke up super confused. I was not tied up, I was still alive. The retching had stopped and I finally got some sleep? My first thought was, was the devil done with my life? It did said it would give back to me once it was done with it, and ruined me but it didn't said when. But what happened while I was gone? I don't know, I have some bits of memories but they were not making sense. It feels like I had leaped through time horizontally into another separate timeline. The patient next to my bed was the first to ask me, ""Are you okay now?"" That's when I realized, I had stopped vomitting/retching/spitting saliva. I survived, I'm okay? I wondered what's the organ damage while I was given more IV drip and injected medication. The social worker and psychiatrist finally talked to me and I learnt that I had a seizure attack. That Creatine Kinase was spiking super high in my blood and I have suffered muscle breakdown from the overdose. My liver was inflamed, and I was finally given something to eat. Liquid soup however for the day. 
* 7am, 27th March morning. I got some sleep, I seemed fine now. Better, I guess but still on diaper. However I have regained all limbs control and the brain feels somewhat lagging but I was still me and I could think. I wanted to see the doctor and understand the damage to my body, but somehow didn't have the chance. Doctor saw me and immediately talked about IMH transfer which sunk my heart. I knew suicide was a crime in Singapore and that means, I now have to pay the price. CGH was also super quick to transfer me to IMH and I was gone by 1pm. *(If staff from CGH is reading this, know that I'm upset that I was not completely recovered first before I was transferred to IMH. But I appreciate the ward upgrade and nurses that went above to help me. Especially the showering and diaper change, and my spamming of the bed bell button. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, for each and everyone. One was especially nice to me but I didn't get your name, sorry)*

This post was longer than I expected, but ultimately I was warded in IMH for another 12 days and they were very confused why someone who was suicidal with the determination to do it 100% certain death, will now be cheerful that his alive. The IMH experience was however super horrible, though some parts of it was great. The nurses, most of them except a few... were super nice to me. However that's probably a separate post as this is too long. It's a fun experience though, being sent to general ward (C class) where all the crazy people are there, fighting and ppl tied up in a ward with 40+ beds and 10 beds per cluster. 4 on each sides of the wall/divider and 2 in the middle. It's like a pandemic situation in India in some haunted hospital where toilet paper and hand soap doesn't exist.

Ultimately, I wanted to share this in hopes that this would give an idea to anyone who wanted to commit suicide. The choice is still ultimately choice but know that its a horrible experience when you are stuck in a situation where you can't die, and can't be saved either. And then ultimately having your freedom stolen for your own safety, cause suicide is a crime. Even though it has been decriminalized recently, the mental act is still enacted. IMH is one messed up place too, there is so much they need to improve. It's weird that the government is encouraging no prejudice or discrimination against ppl with mental problems, but in IMH... you are constantly doubted and your self worth destroyed. They know what's good for you, and you don't know what's good for you is the best way to describe it. 

# Afterthoughts

I hope this post was useful and although I'm glad to be alive and discharged from IMH yesterday. It's kinda weird to have to live life again and somehow life seems weirder now. As if it begun after I woke up in the hospital rather than a continuation of life before the suicide. And somehow I missed my  interactions with the hospital staffs and patients. I feel more lonely now, after discharged. Not being able to interact with new people, face to face and sharing life stories, helping each other and giving advice. I guess, I really missed interacting with people. I plan to use the computer lesser and leave the online world with this new life. Likely would stop using reddit eventually too. Discord chat rooms doesn't replace the human touch which I craved now. Though I am not sure where to get it. I'm trying to adapt to this new life, one step at a time. Ya, its just one step at a time. I honestly dunno if I will harm myself again but I'm trying not to think about it. I really miss the hospital life, somehow. The nurses were all so nice. Can't say the same for the doctors hmmm...

Lastly, well... for sharing my experience. I guess, its also another means of asking for help in this new life forward. I will rest for now, then find a job. Recondition my muscle and have that liver checked, until my blood is normalized. The CK is still above normal and electrolyte is whacked. I ultimately went through a medical condition called ""rhabdomyolysis"" where muscles died due to my toxic overdose, which leads to even more complications. I was not diagnosed with any mental issues from IMH, just stressed out and tired in life. Otherwise, I'm all ok amazingly. Its a miracle, no organ damage? Maybe kidney failure in the future, not sure but otherwise just liver inflammation and some weird lung cough. Hmm... I'm still looking for a girlfriend though, though maybe less desperate. Just want someone to support me and for me to support in this new life, I'm not picky. Nurses would be great though XD. Well that's all I have to say for today, phew that was long.

5,singapore,226356,"[Serious] During this Circuit Breaker, your mental health matters too",fvmd98,deaddontopen,1586124127,21,11,"The Circuit Breaker can be stressful or anxiety-inducing for some people, myself included. For myself, being out everyday isn't really a matter of choice, and in fact was encouraged by my therapist as the most ideal way to deal with my current situation (that was before the whole COVID-19 outbreak). But for now, staying home is the socially responsible thing to do.

For those in the same boat as me, here are some tips I hope can ease your stress or anxiety during this period:

1. Read up on mental health coping tips online. 

A good place to start would be the US CDC's guide on [Mental Health and Coping During COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html).


2. If you need to talk to someone, the Singapore Government is setting up a [dedicated Covid-19 hotline offering emotional support](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/government-to-set-up-covid-19-hotline-offering-emotional-support). 

I'll update this post with more details once the hotline is set up.


3. There are other mental health support hotlines that should be available during this period too. A list is available on [HealthHub](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/support-groups-and-others/20/call-on-these-when-you-need-help).

One very important number to note is the Samaritans of Singapore hotline at 1800-221-4444.  


4. Check out important links and things to do on the r/Singapore [COVID-19 pinned post](https://reddit.app.link/DHtf2sZMr5).  


5. At home, when dealing with abusive or toxic relationships, consider whether it would be worthwhile to fix these broken relationships or to try to avoid contact with the person as much as possible. While no one including me can make this choice for you, please do seek a mental health professional's advice before proceeding.  


6. If you have the budget, sign up for streaming services and make a list of all the shows you want to watch. Try to focus on options that will make you happy or those that help improve your life. It's also the perfect time to sign up for one-month trials of these streaming services.  

If paying for streaming services isn't an option, consider free NLB e-books &amp; magazines on [Libby/OverDrive](https://nlb.overdrive.com) and PressReader. Of course, podcasts and YouTube are a great free way to pass time too.  


7. If you have more money, consider investing in a pair of active noise cancelling headphones because it will help you block out external noise and distractions.  


8. Go out for walks at your park or help shop for groceries and essentials. Fresh air and a change of atmosphere, no matter how short, helps in improving your mood. Do remember to practice safe distancing, wear a mask and check the apps to ensure your public park or shopping mall isn't crowded when you head out.

One option I can think of is the [SG Clean Ambassadors Network](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5e7484a2ca6a010011862c59). You can also go to [SG Cares Volunteer Page](http://www.volunteer.sg) to see more volunteer roles. If you want to earn some extra cash, I think applying for roles such as food delivery rider would be of great help during this time as there would be lots of demand.

To Singaporeans: do not make us go down.

Currently we are able to tide things through using whatever financial budget that Singapore has. Easing on payments, giving out stimulus and every other measures. The government has tried pumping in a lot of resources into all these tests, stay home notices and other measures. 

This is not a long term solution for us Singaporeans. Throwing money into the pit to try and slow down the spread.

 'Gahment so much money, can one la'. Of course Singapore can spend this much money but that doesn't mean we should be spending it. Cause these money is from all of us, saved up and spent wisely. 

The government is doing their best in their own ways to resolve this problem. But as long as Singaporeans continue to act irresponsibly, this situation will either become A) we run out of resources B) we can kiss our stability as a nation goodbye. 

Some cultures are toxic, that i agree. Workplaces calling people chao geng for MC-ing from work. Sick people are hence socially obligated to go in even if sick, only to become the scapegoat when shit hits the fan. 

Some people think 'aiya, wont happen one. Whats the chance? I so healthy'. Young people like that, good luck. Hope you don't get infected because your mentality will be what drags the entire country down. Just recall the Korean Ajumma. 

Let us fight this together as Singaporeans. Respect our healthcare workers, supermarket staffs and all other workers who make the country continue to run. Let us be more responsible for our own nation, or at the minimum, to our own closed ones.

By George Yeo

Singapore, 17 January 2020

&amp;#x200B;

**Human Solidarity in a Fragmenting World**

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

&amp;#x200B;

I first heard of Prof Ransome from my elder brother, Peter.  He is 7 years my senior.  When he was in Medical School, I was in Secondary School and shared a room with him in our old house at East Coast Terrace.  He would often tell me stories about this remarkable English doctor who could diagnose diseases accurately, often based only on observation, palpation and even by smell.  

&amp;#x200B;

When Dr Sayampanathan asked me early last year if I could deliver the Gordon Arthur Ransome Oration, I resonated immediately, my mind going back to stories I heard a long time ago.  I thank the Singapore  Academy of Medicine for giving me this signal honour.

&amp;#x200B;

This Oration was originally planned to be held in Hong Kong last December in conjunction with an event co-organized by the Academies of Medicine of Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.  Unfortunately, that event had to be cancelled because of the unsettled situation in Hong Kong.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hong Kong**

&amp;#x200B;

No one expected the protests which began in June last year to become so big and to last so long. As a legislator of many years, I decided to download the Extradition Bill and read it for myself. Frankly, I did not find the proposed amendments to existing laws unreasonable.  It did not seem right that one could  commit rape or murder in China and find sanctuary in Hong Kong.  

&amp;#x200B;

However, most Hongkongers viewed the Bill differently and were outraged that the Chief Executive Carrie Lam was determined to get it passed despite mass opposition. Looking back, the Bill was only the spark that set off a forest fire.  For many years after the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997, the fuel load in the forest had been building up.  Social injustice had gotten worse.  Most parents in Hong Kong no longer believed that their children could do better than them.  As a result, there is not a sense of hope and, without a sense of hope, society turns sour.  The lack of affordable housing is egregious.  

&amp;#x200B;

During colonial times, the HK civil service was conditioned to take instructions from London.  The British approach was to govern firmly but lightly unless their core interests were affected, leaving people to fend for themselves.  After 1997, Beijing left Hong Kong to govern itself, not giving instructions the way London did. However, the HK Adminstration changed little; vested interests remained comfortably in place; and political leadership was lacking.  Hong Kong has a well-developed social and economic establishment but not a political establishment.  Under the British, it was not desirable for Hong Kong to have its own political culture.  Perhaps China should have been more interventionist after 1997 but, for a variety of reasons, including the selfish interest of groups from the Mainland which found Hong Kong’s separate status convenient, it left things be.

&amp;#x200B;

Worse, the people of Hong Kong had to struggle with an identity crisis.  Older Hongkongers had fled the Mainland during earlier periods of upheaval and distrusted Beijing - 1949, the Great Leap Forward, the mass famine of the early 60’s, the Cultural Revolution and June 4th.  The majority of teachers from Primary One to University are anti-Mainland and pass prejudices against China, especially against the Chinese Communist Party, on to their charges.  To be a student leader in university, you have to honour June 4th.  Most Hongkongers know that they cannot be independent but many prefer not to identify themselves as Chinese citizens.  At the top, they hold multiple passports.  

&amp;#x200B;

When Deng Xiaoping proposed One Country, Two Systems, the precondition for it to work was that Hongkongers must not only love Hong Kong, they must also love China.  一国两制，爱国爱港，港人治港. In fact, loving China should come first but it will take time and much effort for that to be put right.  National education in Hong Kong has been neglected for too long.

&amp;#x200B;

After leaving government in 2011, I joined Robert Kuok in Hong Kong.  My wife and I shuttle back and forth between the two cities. Hong Kong has become for us a second home.  We now have our own social circle there including a number of young Hongkongers interested in politics.  Some of them are yellow, some are blue; all feel deeply for Hong Kong.  We ourselves have developed an affection for Hong Kong and its people, and decided, after my retirement as Chairman of Kerry Logistics last year, to buy an apartment near Hong Kong University. Like many others, we were shocked by the rapid deterioration of Hong Kong in the last 8 months.  Unlike many others, we remain cautiously optimistic for Hong Kong’s long term future because of its special position half-in and half-out of China and the resilience of its people. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is however not my intention to talk principally about Hong Kong today.  The reason for my raising Hong Kong is because there are larger, deeper forces at work in Hong Kong which affect the whole world.  We have to be mindful of them because they affect us in Singapore too.  These forces are unleashed by technology and challenge us morally.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to highlight four in particular - the social media revolution, fragmentation and reconfiguration of human society, growing wealth and income inequality, and mass manipulation by new masters of the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

**Social Media Revolution**

&amp;#x200B;

First, the social media revolution.

&amp;#x200B;

When the Internet arrived in the 90’s, many  saw it as liberating.  It became much easier to access information.  Patients have already googled their symptoms before seeing doctors and everything the doctor said and prescribed could be counter checked on the net.  

&amp;#x200B;

In the same way, teachers are challenged by students, and government leaders by the citizenry. At home, parents have come to accept that, for many things and in many areas, they have to rely on their children for information and advice.  

&amp;#x200B;

The social media revolution has disrupted old relationships.  Everywhere, we see hierarchies breaking down.  Old institutions, once preserved and sustained by ritual, secrecy, information asymmetry, hypocrisy, deception and force are being corroded.  Traditional leaders are dragged down from their ivory towers and shown to be quite ordinary and fallible after all, their hypocrisy and corruption exposed by ubiquitous cameras and microphones. 

&amp;#x200B;

When Pope Francis smacked an Asian lady twice on the arm after she grabbed him by his sleeve in St Peter’s Square and refused to let go, it immediately became news all over the world.  The Pope quickly apologised the day after.  A Mainland Chinese friend of mine told me that it actually made the Pope look quite good because it showed him to be human.  It is just as well that Francis, since becoming Pope, frequently declares himself a sinner.

&amp;#x200B;

Old leadership models have become obsolete.  Whether it is Pope Francis, President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Elon Musk or Greta Thunberg, we are in a new situation.  It sometimes seems as if a necessary qualification for leadership is to be publicly a sinner. The term used nowadays is ‘authenticity’ although that too is often manufactured.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fragmentation and Reconfiguration of Human Society**

&amp;#x200B;

Human society takes time to adjust to new technologies.  The IT revolution shows no sign of abating.  In fact it is setting off concomitant change in other technological fields like biomedicine, material science and manufacturing.  These changes in turn act upon one another, often in unexpected ways, causing even further disruption to the old order. 

&amp;#x200B;

In his analysis of economic cycles, the Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, wrote about creative destruction.  What we see all around is the destructive phase of the technological revolution which is fragmenting human society.  This fragmentation, which is the second force I am highlighting today, defines the age we live in.

&amp;#x200B;

Going back to Hong Kong, what characterises the protest movement is its fluid, leaderless, organic character.  The social media reinforces beliefs and biases.  Those who are yellow watch yellow sites, get angrier and become more yellow.  For many, police officers have become the villains and even their family members are targeted. For those who are blue, the demonstrators are cockroaches to be smacked down. Views become highly, absurdly polarised.  We hear of couples breaking up and parents who are no longer able to talk to their children.  Unmediated positive feedback loops quickly become unstable. The same phenomenon is evident in the US today, Taiwan during the recent elections, the UK when the Brexit debate was raging, and in many other countries.

&amp;#x200B;

Fragmentation is however not the end state.  Gradually, the fragments recombine in new ways, similar to the pattern of neural networks. Nodes grow and compete with other nodes with which they are linked through multiple pathways.  There is a biological quality about these new forms of organization.  It is almost as if we are witnessing a Cambrian explosion of diverse organisational species.  Those which successfully adapt to the new environment proliferate while others reach dead ends.  Apple, Samsung and Huawei have very different organisational structures and systems.  Which among them will still be successful ten years from now no one can foretell but for sure that there will be new winners and losers.  

&amp;#x200B;

Losing faith in existing institutions, there is at one level a reversion to tribal networks of trust. Some of these networks are based on ethnicity and religion.  Some years ago, Joel Koetkin in his book ‘Tribes’ wrote about the tribal networks which undergird global commerce like those of the Mormons, Jews, Parsees, Jains, Armenians and Chinese.  Among the Chinese, there are regional networks which stand out like the Wenzhou connection.  We also see new tribal networks forming around specific causes such as LGBT rights, climate activism, even veganism.

&amp;#x200B;

There is an obverse and negative side to this phenomenon.  Networks like Al Qaeda and ISIS have similar morphologies but are destructive.  Anti-Semitism has also become more pronounced fuelled by groups which corroborate each other’s prejudices on the Internet.   Positive or negative, politicians everywhere are quick to pick up populist causes to win votes, undermining the civil society which is the bedrock of democracy.

&amp;#x200B;

Political systems are subject to the same creative destruction.  Western democratic systems no longer function well. Long-established political parties are fissuring. In many democracies, domestic political debate have become toxic. The seeming success of China’s system is an affront to western liberal democracies.  China’s authoritarian Communism is not supposed to work well.  Yet it has raised hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and enabled the country to join the front rank of nations in many fields causing the US to view it as a strategic threat. China sees its own system as unique and does not seek to export it to others.  But China’s relative success does give hope and heart to many developing countries that there are other ways to the future.  They do not have to take the path of western liberal democracies.  I say ‘relative success’ because China too faces enormous challenges.  Political systems and organisations which are unable to evolve to new needs become dysfunctional and unstable.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, at all levels, from the family to companies to political structures, we see continuing fragmentation, experimentation and reconfiguration.  It is a process which can be described as Darwinian.

&amp;#x200B;

**Growing Wealth and Income Inequality**

&amp;#x200B;

The third force impacting society today is growing wealth and income inequality.

&amp;#x200B;

Wealth and income inequality in Hong Kong is an important underlying cause of the current unrest.  According to a recent study by the Asian Competitiveness Institute at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, the inequality has gotten worse in recent years.  Without a strong injection of socialism, Hong Kong society will remain fractured.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is worldwide and not confined to Hong Kong alone.  The impact of technological change on individual fortunes is uneven.  Once upon a time, hardworking, responsible employees could expect their lives to improve year by year.  Today many feel they are struggling to run up a downward-moving escalator.  Those whose work are repetitive are at great risk.  Their jobs can be outsourced to countries where labor is cheaper.  Or be replaced by robots and algorithms. 

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast, those who are well-placed to seize new opportunities created by fragmentation prosper. For example, among new graduates, computer engineers command among the highest salaries.  Many companies remain stuck in the past.  Those who are able to disrupt them become rich and are lionized.  When we look at the league table of the most successful companies in the world,  the top positions are increasingly held by those in technology.  In Singapore, Sea, which is a company specialising in gaming and e-commerce - a company which most Singaporeans have not heard of - has quite suddenly become one of the top companies, with a capitalisation half that of Singapore Telecoms.  

&amp;#x200B;

The flood of global liquidity released by central banks after the Global Financial Crisis has unfairly benefited a relatively small group of companies and individuals, accentuating wealth and income inequality in the world. Those who are well-connected to governments and to wealthy families, especially in high finance and tech, are able to access cheap money while the great majority of small and medium enterprises pay higher interest rates.  Inflation in asset prices have skewed wealth further to those who are already wealthy.  In many developing countries, those already invested in asset classes like property get richer while the rest struggle to buy a first home.  This is being perpetuated down one generation.  Many successful start-ups are founded by young men and women who are themselves scions of wealthy well-connected families.

&amp;#x200B;

Growing inequality of wealth and income exacerbates existing class and ethnic divisions in society.  In many countries, large groups resent being systematically disadvantaged and left behind. This frustration, though still inchoate, has become widespread. ‘Yellow jacket’ protests in France are part of this phenomenon. There are eerie similarities between the protests in Hong Kong and those far away in Barcelona and Santiago.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mass Manipulation by the New Masters of the Universe**

&amp;#x200B;

The fourth force challenging us is the way big data and the social media are being used to manipulate the way we think.

&amp;#x200B;

The first phase of the internet revolution opened the floodgates to information access and eroded old power structures.  For a short while, there was an exhilarating sense of equalisation.  That phase has ended. We are increasingly discovering how our minds are being manipulated by new masters of the universe.  

&amp;#x200B;

Companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Alibaba and Tencent make use of the enormous data they collect to squeeze out competitors and influence our preferences often without our knowledge.  In Singapore and elsewhere, a very high percentage of ad revenues is cornered by Google and Facebook because of the eyeballs they have captured.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks after the HK unrest started, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, in quick succession, blocked hundreds of sites which they claim besmirched protesters, giving the reason that these sites originated from China.  Sites which supported the protesters were untouched.  It is unclear who made these decisions but I don’t think they were made in Hong Kong. There is no doubt that the way friction is increased or reduced in different parts of the Internet can significantly sway public opinion.   Trapped in an old mindset, the Hong Kong Government was unable or unwilling to intervene.

&amp;#x200B;

Other governments have no such inhibitions.  India routinely shuts down the Internet in various cities when there are riots to calm public anger.  Kashmir was denied the Internet for months, a decision which the Indian Supreme Court judged unlawful earlier this week. When mass demonstrations erupted in Iran after fuel prices were raised, the government switched off Facebook causing Secretary Pompeo to threaten sanctions on those responsible.  In the battle for hearts and minds in Iran, the US actively intervenes in the way Facebook, Twitter and Instagram cover developments in the country.  Sympathetic coverage of General Suleimani has been systematically blocked.

&amp;#x200B;

The big powers devote considerable resources to the exploitation of the social media for political purposes.  Domestically, they may be constrained by national law.  Externally, there are no restrictions.  In 2013, Edward Snowden revealed the existence of Prism, an incredible system developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA) to collect internet information worldwide.  All governments would love to have such a capability but none can hope to, and certainly not on the same scale as the US except, possibly, China one day.

&amp;#x200B;

A key reason for the US campaign against Huawei is the fear that China may not only develop a similar surveillance capability but Chinese equipment and Chinese systems will make it harder for the US to maintain the same surveillance reach.  For some countries like Singapore, the only safe assumption is that all systems expose us to external intelligence penetration.  We have to find ways to protect ourselves and accept that nothing is foolproof.  The challenge is made much harder with increasing dependence on clouds. 

&amp;#x200B;

China makes no pretense about controlling the Internet.  President Xi himself declared that the development of the Internet is an integral part of national development and not separate from it.  All internet providers in China accept the leadership of the Communist Party. They have no choice. In fact, China is probably the first country to make extensive use of big data for national governance.  Big data analysis has enabled China to overcome a problem which afflicted its governance system over the centuries.  Because of the size of the country, there are many layers of administration making it hard for Beijing to know what’s happening on the ground.  Corrupt officials often succeed in covering up problems by working with counterparts one level above to suppress complaints.  When problems do reach the Centre, it is because they have already become big and serious.  To overcome this defect, Chinese dynasties develop elaborate systems of inspection from the Imperial Court.  Wrongs do get righted but they are so rare, the stories are immortalised in Chinese operas.  With big data analysis, it is easier for Beijing to be alerted earlier.  Information systems monitor the overall shape of data.  When there are signs of inflammation, Beijing zoom in to find out more. Once lower level officials know that it is hard to cover up, they behave better.  In fact, securities agencies like the NSA use similar methods to spot potential terrorist attacks by monitoring internet chatter.

&amp;#x200B;

In Xinjiang, China is criticized by western and Muslim countries for the way information is collected and used, including the mass deployment of facial recognition.  Whether the Chinese method of curbing terrorism is more effective than the western method of acting forcefully only when the evidence has become clear is still an open question.  The difference is not unlike the methods used for treating cancer.  The western method of tackling terrorism is akin to surgery and chemotherapy such as the use of Predator drones to kill terrorists.  The Chinese method is to treat the body politic holistically, gradually boosting its immunity.  Immunotherapy however requires patience and a deeper understanding of complex reality.  

&amp;#x200B;

For many westerners, China has become George Orwell’s 1984.  For many Chinese, the loss of privacy is a price worth paying for safety and convenience.  There is probably no safer big country than China today. But will the centralization of control lead to massive abuse one day? The Chinese Communist Party is not immune to the same forces of change in the world.  It has to evolve in response to new circumstances.  By cracking down on corruption and re-establishing moral authority, President Xi Jinping has bought time for China and the Communist Party.  

&amp;#x200B;

In the US, what intelligence and law enforcement agencies are allowed to do is the subject of a raging debate. Trump has raged against fake news since his Presidential campaign. Is the deep state out of control?  Well it depends on whom you ask.  There is also growing reaction against the big tech companies.  Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren is campaigning for their breakup, which alarms Mark Zuckerberg. She is a policy wonk and has thought through the implications of such a move.

&amp;#x200B;

In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation, commonly known as GDPR, came into force two years ago.  In provides some safeguard to the misuse or abuse of data collection.  This may make it more difficult for Europe to catch up with the US and China in AI.  However, the use of facial recognition technology is not likely to be held back because it is simply too useful.  

&amp;#x200B;

Thus we see in the world today a range of responses to the challenge of big data, in particular, the loss of privacy and the mass manipulation of public opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

In Singapore, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act, commonly known as POFMA, is a brave attempt to stem the same incoming tide.  It is not easy but we should not stop trying.

&amp;#x200B;

**Moral Challenge**

&amp;#x200B;

The revolution in IT is enabling the collection, storage and processing of data on an unprecedented scale without theoretical limit.  It is almost as if nothing that happens will ever be forgotten again.  In China, to ensure better disease control, there is an effort to recognise every pig either facially or from the back.  The pig population in China is almost half a billion.  For computer engineers, this is a trivial problem.  Every detail of every human being on the planet living today and in the future will eventually be monitored, recorded and analysed.  With AI, his probable behaviour will also be known.  It is a scary prospect.

&amp;#x200B;

This leap in the collective intelligence of human beings has a god-like quality about it.  There does not seem to be any phenomenon which we cannot as a species potentially understand.  

(As an aside, I do not believe that the kind of AI (Artificial Intelligence) Elon Musk talks about can replace collective human intelligence.  AI requires either that there is sufficient past data about collective human behaviour to predict the future or that the rules of collective human behaviour can be repeatedly simulated.  Neither condition exists.  The history of human civilisation is too short and too complex for AI to ever master.)

&amp;#x200B;

That which the technological revolution has unleashed is however two-edged.  There is always a temptation to weaponise the newest technology in order to gain a military advantage.  In the biological world, you either produce or you take away from someone else what he has produced.  Anything which lives must solve the dual challenge of production and security.  Thus every new technology is used for both creation and destruction, for both good and evil.  

&amp;#x200B;

It takes time for the moral sense of human beings to catch up with new technologies and to tame them.  In the last century, mechanisation, mass production and nuclear energy led to the slaughter of over a hundred million people.  Whether we will be wiser in this century is still an open question.  There is an air of hubris in the way the new masters of the universe view their growing capabilities.  This hubris infects us at all levels - state agencies which are carried away by the use of technology; politicians who rely on clever data analytics to manipulate voters; generals who fantasise unstoppable spears and impregnable shields; economists who believe that the manipulation of money supply can rid us of economic cycles; corporate leaders whose ambitions know no bounds; successful tribes and wealthy individuals who are convinced of their own genetic superiority; scientists who tinker with germ lines to improve the quality of human beings; and computer engineers who see AI as the ultimate.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Memento Mori**

&amp;#x200B;

It is said that in Roman times, a victorious general in a triumphal procession would have behind him a slave whispering into his ears ‘memento mori’ which means ‘remember, you will die’.  It is a warning against hubris, a call to humility and restraint when one is successful.

&amp;#x200B;

Whether as parents, teachers, doctors, government ministers or corporate leaders, we must therefore not lose our moral sense in the pursuit of achievement and success.  It is important to contemplate human weakness, and the meaning of suffering and death.  It is in pathos that we forge group solidarity.  In an age of fragmentation, solidarity is vital.  In everything we do, we must not ignore those who are wounded or have fallen by the wayside.  Without this social glue, civilized society breaks down.

&amp;#x200B;

Tectonic change has caused the old edifices to crumble into smaller pieces.  We must rebuild but with the expectation that the ground will continue to quake.  We need simpler structures which are flexibly linked to one another, like those in a Middle Eastern souk.  Above all, we need solidarity which is the instinct to connect and bond.

&amp;#x200B;

Solidarity

&amp;#x200B;

Human society cannot be organized on the basis of law and the market alone.  Laws only mark outer boundaries.  Laws can require parents to look after children. Laws cannot make parents love their children, or vice versa. The market is a powerful way of allocating resources in a complex economy.  But the market alone cannot solve many human problems.  We are all familiar with Adam Smith’s ‘invisible hand’ but we often forget that he was first and foremost a moral philosopher.  Take the healthcare system for example.  If doctors are only bound to their patients by the money nexus, many diseases will be poorly treated or mistreated however clever AI systems become.

&amp;#x200B;

Human society needs solidarity as a cohesive force to bind human beings together in cooperative effort.  In traditional Confucius teaching, stress is put on five core values:  仁义礼智信 - broadly speaking meaning benevolence, justice, proper behaviour, wisdom and trust.  All moral systems incorporate and elaborate these values.  These values are deep in our nature and probably encoded in our DNA.  

&amp;#x200B;

In order to remain relevant, these moral systems, which include religion and ideology, must adapt to new challenges thrown up by technology.  Take 礼 or proper behaviour as an example.  For human beings to interact, we need protocols facilitating communication and cooperation.  When individuals are masked, whether in public or on the Internet, protocols are hard to establish.  In anonymous settings, individuals quickly become irresponsible and abusive.  Civilised behaviour requires behavioral responses which are generally agreed to and therefore predictable.  Interestingly, it is protocols like TCP/IP which made possible the Internet in the first place. The fact of the matter is that there can be no freedom without accountability. Without a moral sense, the new freedom which technology offers destroys itself.  

&amp;#x200B;

At the heart of the situation in Hong Kong today is a moral crisis. Two nights ago in Hong Kong, I had dinner with Gary Wong, a young Hong Kong political leader whom I have known for some years.  Together with Jasper Tsang, former President of Legco, Raymond Mak, another young political leader whom I had dinner with the night PolyU was encircled and five others, they decided in the late evening of 18 November to enter PolyU which was then under siege by Hong Kong Police in order to persuade the few hundred remaining diehard protestors to leave.  They made the decision after receiving a WhatsApp message from a young girl in PolyU with a heartrending plea for help. After consulting Government leaders, the Police agreed for the group to enter on the understanding that the Police could not ensure their safety.  Indeed, they were greeted by arrows on the draw pointed at them as they crossed the barricade. The campus was a war zone.  They were shocked that among the protestors were many who were well-educated, some from well-to-do families. There were some girls who were as young as 12. Eventually, they succeeded in persuading some 70 protestors to leave.  There were loud cheers when they came out. Not only by the crowd outside PolyU, but by many all over Hong Kong watching the drama on television and the social media. Chief Executive Carrie Lam decided wisely that those below the age of 18 could go home once they had their names registered. 

&amp;#x200B;

The polarization  in Hong Kong had reached a point when protestors who wanted to leave did not believe they could trust the authorities.  The majority of Hong Kong youth today has developed a visceral antipathy toward the Hong Kong Police,  Yet it was not long ago when the Hong Kong Police was rated among the best in the world.  And, from the other side, among many in authority and the older generation, there is anger and grief vis-a-vis a younger generation which had seemingly turned wayward.  It will take time to clean the wounds and for the wounds to heal.  China has despatched former Party Secretary of Qinghai and Shanxi, Luo Huining, to Hong Kong.  He is new to Hong Kong and will bring a fresh mind to bear on the problems.  He will have to work with Hong Kong leaders who showed physical and moral courage, and wisdom, during the recent crisis to restore solidarity in Hong Kong and between Hong Kong and the Mainland.

&amp;#x200B;

In all fields, we need moral leadership.  The great danger today is the revolution in technology outpacing the evolution of our moral sense. Whether in the private, public or people sector, in grappling with economic and technical questions, we should never de-emphasise moral considerations.  It is common nowadays for decisions to be taken in an amoral way. An indifferent, amoral approach in a period of rapid technological change is possibly the greatest danger to humankind today. We must not be beguiled by a so-called post-truth world.  The more complex the world becomes, the more must we affirm that which is at the core of our humanity.

&amp;#x200B;

The human quality of Prof Gordon Arthur Ransome as described by Prof Seah Cheng Siang is therefore worth recalling.

“He is always ready to render a helping hand when a fellow doctor himself is in trouble.  ...he has an ever constant ear which in itself is therapy.  Time appears to him to be of no consequence when it comes to giving it to someone else.  The distressed talks on and he listens. A few careful chosen words of advice now and then provides the panacea.”

**Abstract**

&amp;#x200B;

Information technology is altering power relationships in human society.  The first stage is destructive.  Old institutions and hierarchies, preserved and sustained by ritual, secrecy, information asymmetry, hypocrisy, deception and force are being corroded.  For example, the social media has forced leaders down from their ivory towers revealing them for what they are, warts and all. The relationship between parents and children, teachers and students, priests and laity, government and governed is all changing causing great stress to traditional society.  The old world is fragmenting.  The pieces are however reconnecting in new ways with patterns more akin to neural networks.  New nodes are forming with multiple connections in ceaseless competition with other nodes.  This reconfiguration is still in the initial stages.  The gathering and processing of vast amounts of data create new power centers. Edward Snowden revealed the scope of US National Security Agency’s Prism project.  The Chinese Government is concentrating more data than anyone else and using it not only for surveillance but also to reduce corruption and improve governance.  Huawei is but one example of the overt and covert competition for data at the political level.  Commercially, tech conglomerates like Facebook, Google, Amazon, Tencent and Alibaba have been expanding at the expense of traditional players.  There is now a growing political backlash at them.  In the west, there are calls to limit their power either by breaking them up or regulating them more tightly especially in the way they make use of private data.  In China, all tech companies know that they cannot afford to run afoul of the Chinese Communist Party.  Will big data and AI lead to ever growing concentration of power?  Is the future 1984?  Or will clever computer minds succeed in creating decentralized internet webs and decentralized AI?  It will take time for human relationships and human institutions to adapt to the revolution in technology.  In the meantime, we must expect a long transition marked by disruption and confusion.  All major advances in technology are marked by a choice between good and evil. Our moral sense is still struggling to catch up with the new powers being unleashed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/er8vrm/human_solidarity_in_a_fragmenting_world_by_george/,0.0,['my moral sense and solidarity cant allow me to put up a staunch defense for a convicted pedophile']

So stay or leave? Talking Point deliberates the question — and whether these online groups are inadvertently hurting children.\n\n&gt; SINGAPORE: Banu Partiban’s daughter was in her first month at primary school when she and her husband received a WhatsApp message from another parent.\n\n&gt; “It was a picture message. This parent circled my child. The parent wrote, ‘Can I know who’s the parent of this child?’” she recounted.\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; It was sent to a parents’ group chat, which was “not a very nice thing to (do)”. An upset Banu had parents approaching her, seemingly thinking something was wrong, to ask what happened and why her girl was singled out.\n\n&gt; She reached out to the parent privately — the better approach in the first place, she thought. It turned out that their children had a minor dispute, which they eventually resolved.\n\n&gt; The incident came as a “shock”, occurring within days of her joining the WhatsApp group. But she remained in the group because, as a working parent, she did not want to miss anything important for her child’s schooling.\n\n&gt; Chances are parents today are in a parents’ group chat or even a few groups. But not all see the need for this.\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Some parents — and children — describe these WhatsApp groups as “competitive”, and as the question of whether to stay or leave arises, the programme Talking Point investigates whether parents’ group chats are even becoming toxic or inadvertently hurting children. (Watch the episode here.)\n\n&gt; THE 90-9-1 TYPES OF PARENTS\n\n&gt; Winston Tay, for one, was in a group chat when his child was in Primary One to Primary Three, but he left because the parents had “a lot of idiosyncrasies”.\n\n&gt; “On Sunday nights especially, there’d be a flurry of messages,” he recalled, citing queries about homework for the weekend.\n\n&gt; “And we realised that we had certain parents who’d … ask, ‘How have your kids’ results been? My kids’ results are this.’ So after a while, it started getting a little bit annoying.”\n\n&gt; On the other hand, these WhatsApp groups have been “very useful” for mother of two, Serene Seah, who admitted to being “forgetful” and needing reminders.\n\n&gt; Parents discuss the pros and cons of being in their children’s class WhatsApp group chats.\n\n&gt; The two parents belong to two of the three types of people generally in online communities, which are what parents’ WhatsApp groups are.\n\n&gt; Research by the Nielsen Norman Group found that 90 per cent of users are quiet observers who only read the messages, 9 per cent are active in the conversations, and 1 per cent are very active users who provide a lot of information.\n\n&gt; While that is a general view of online communities, Talking Point found specific descriptors associated with people in parents’ WhatsApp groups: The blur sotong; the know-it-all; the chat-a-lot; the show-off; the life coach; and the lurker, who does not contribute.\n\n&gt; With such parents in these WhatsApp groups, chat administrators such as William Choo must play the role of “policeman” to ensure that the chats stay civil.\n\n&gt; “(Some parents) try to dig out information like … your kid’s score,” said the father of three. “I’d try to tell them, ‘Please don’t compare.’\n\n&gt; “We need to have someone (as) the neutral party, to let every member of the group chat have peace of mind, for example (through) simple rules like ‘No messaging after, say, 11pm’ … no sensitive issues (and) no bad-mouthing each other.”\n\n&gt; IMPACT ON TEACHERS\n\n&gt; The use of WhatsApp could also expose teachers to disparaging remarks, insults and contempt shown by parents.\n\n&gt; For example, one of the reasons Lenny Syafawatie Abdul Rahman gave up teaching at primary school after 14 years was she had to manage difficult parents, offline and online, even when she was not part of these group chats.\n\n&gt; “You’d think twice about what you say in class because you’re afraid that whatever you say would be misinterpreted by the kids,” said the full-time tutor. “Parents would spread it among themselves (and) change the whole story.\n\n&gt; Parents are quicker to share the negatives rather than the positives.\n\n&gt; In one incident when she had a class of 40 pupils, a parent took a snapshot of her marking and put it in the group chat.\n\n&gt; “She said, ‘You all better check your kid’s work. This teacher just anyhow marks.’ It was actually one (mathematics answer) marked wrongly,” Lenny related.\n\n&gt; “Nowadays (parents) are a bit kiasu, they get a bit kancheong (anxious), so they all panicked, and they started checking each and every one of their kid’s work … I was a bit upset because it was a small matter.”\n\n&gt; The 35-year-old agreed with Talking Point host Diana Ser that, from a parent’s perspective, WhatsApp group chats “allow for some kind of checks and balances” in that parents should know what happens within a school and the issues at stake.\n\n&gt; But she suggested checking with the teacher involved rather than making “a mountain out of a molehill” by, for example, “going straight to school leaders”.\n\n&gt; In these situations, Seah tries to “send positive vibes"" in her group chats. “When you feel that the tension is building up, like resentment against the teachers, someone’s got to be there to put out the fire,” she said.\n\n&gt; CREATING A CRUTCH?\n\n&gt; As a tool to improve parental involvement and keep up with what goes on at school, WhatsApp group chats work a treat, especially for parents worried about their children not paying attention in class or forgetting to take notes.\n\n&gt; But if parents rely on others for information to fill in gaps like test dates, does this not make their children less self-reliant?\n\n&gt; Diana Ser finds out from a group of pupils whether they’re too reliant on their parents’ group chats.\n\n&gt; Xavier Chua is one who “often” forgets to do his homework, but parents in his mother’s group chat would keep her informed, and then he gets scolded.\n\n&gt; To him, however, that is not the trouble with these groups. “The bad part comes when the parents share other people’s results,” said the 11-year-old, whose parents may sometimes point out those with higher marks to him.\n\n&gt; Manassvi Arora, who is also 11 years old, agreed. “Sometimes when you compare results in the chat, like when everybody (scores) better than you … you can take it positively if it (happens) the first or second time,” she said.\n\n&gt; “But when it always happens, you feel kind of bad that you can’t be better than the rest of your classmates.”\n\n&gt; Despite the competition encountered, the five pupils Talking Point had gathered did not want their parents to leave these group chats — as that would mean, said 10-year-old Belinda Low, that “we have to pay more attention at school”.\n\n&gt; Digital literacy trainer Carol Loi, who runs workshops on parenting in the digital age, said parents may not be supporting their children’s learning if they “provide them with a crutch all the time”.\n\n&gt; She recommends helping children to see the consequences of “some of the things that they’ve forgotten” and what they can “learn from the whole experience”.\n\n&gt; “That’s more important than going straight to … get the information for them and just give it to them,” said the 49-year-old.\n\n&gt; For parents evaluating whether to leave their group chats, Choo has this piece of advice: “If you can 100 per cent depend on your kids — that means you don’t rely on this ‘information centre’ — (then) you can do it.”\n\n&gt; Watch this episode of Talking Point here.

11,singapore,218474,Should I sign on with the SAF ?,fbmvs6,AMAXiate_,1583027023,39,1,"hi guys so some backstory first:

basically I'm interested in signing on as a C4X under SAF's C4I — doing cyber security (or so that's what I THINK I'm gonna be doing — I've heard from regulars that they usually shift you around the organization so u might not always be doing the same thing/the stuff u want to do)

I felt like signing on because I do have a strong interest in computing related topics (i plan to study Com Science in uni) and cyber security is definitely a pretty good industry to join these days. Moreover, my parents have already hit retirement age and I would like them to rest and stop working already — so I really need a scholarship for university. Furthermore, if I signed on i go to university a whole year earlier — so i start working earlier (then you do the compound interest and time value of money shit and you'll realise a year earlier of work makes a huge difference in earnings over time)

So here comes the dilemma: recently I got my A Level results and it's pretty good — 90rp and a h3 distinction — and now everyone around me is telling me not to sign on because it's just wasting my potential, and that I should try for other scholarships. but i fear the risk of not getting one in the end because of how competitive it is — if i signed on i will get a scholarship (or at the minimum, a local study award) for sure, and I may even get one that will pay for overseas university fees as well.

and here comes the 2nd dilemma: the bureaucracy and culture of the SAF. a few NSMen and regulars have told me that the SAF suffers from a really toxic environment, and basically I'll spend the rest of my life trying to angkat my boss if i signed on (but tbh, doesn't this happen for all private companies too ? idk) and that I'll definitely regret it, so this kinda scares me too

I've always thought that working for the military would be an interesting and fulfilling job — like I get to defend my loved ones and all (sounds cliché, i know) but as a chao recruit that's my perception of army so far because I haven't experienced it long enough to tell what's bad, so I'm here to ask for anyone's advice on the matter. if there are any regulars/C4X personnel can ya help advise me on what should I do ?



TLDR; 
Benefits &amp; my motivations of signing on so far: 
1. Pay is not bad 
2. Scholarships (important !) 
3. I go university a year earlier 
4. I think it's a fulfilling job to be in, cos protecc people and stuff heh


Questions i need help in finding an answer too: 1. What are some legitimate motivations to sign on with the SAF ? 
2. Is the environment really as bad as people say ? 
3. Should I consider scholarships outside of the SAF and take the risk of not getting one at all ?



my sign on contract is in a weeks time btw, so I do need to make a decision soon. pls halp guys i not sure what to do :')",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fbmvs6/should_i_sign_on_with_the_saf/,0.0,"['I am sure with your result , you can definitely get a scholarship from NUS or NTU']"
12,singapore,215152,"Need to offload some career-related anxiety (and seek some advice/validation, maybe?)",f47dmr,wildheart38,1581759965,14,1,"I have been on r/sg for slightly under 2 years. In my time here, I think I have complained about my first job out of university many times. Don’t wish to dox myself but I can safely say that I was in one of the public service agencies (stat board), in charge of one of the most disinteresting and no-prospect stuffs. Had no sense of self-actualization from the work either. I wish I could say more on it ... but as i mentioned I dont want to dox myself. 

I was from a humanities major. Writing was my forte, when you compare it to other skillsets that I may possess. But my previous role was more ops-based. Writing wasn’t really required. And through my 1.5 years I felt that my writing skills have regressed alot. I couldn’t write as sharply anymore. Went to look at my past academic exercises and was really amazed that it was written by me once 😂 My cognitive reasoning skills have worsened, I feel. 

It was also a public-facing role and some of the members of public can be highly unreasonable. It wasn’t enjoyable. Also, the staff size in that department is huge. So it was rife with cliquish gossips, petty politics and loads of deadweight which made it a toxic work environment. My boss was pretty incompetent and horrible too, so much so that my unit experienced high turnover rate. I got arrowed to do saikang and had my credits stolen. I was pushed to do major projects or answer audit queries alone (but without the credits). But I persevered and struggled through 1.5 years which isn’t exactly a long time, but it was already quite commendable when considering the fact that people leave my unit after 6months - a year. 
However, work-life balance was very good. Generally, there is no need to bring work home and you can leave largely on time. Its a place where you can be on auto-pilot mode. Haha. 

I joined a Ministry this year. Policy-role and it was A COMPLETE OPPOSITE. My department is much much smaller, and thus there is no time to play politics because everyone is so busy. My boss is much better (though she has high standards). My colleagues and buddies are smart and willing to help you. But i come to realize that work in a Ministry is fast-paced and quite unlike a statutory board. The work that you do is also under greater scrutiny by both senior management (which includes political office holders) and the masses, even though the role isn’t so much public-facing (which I am glad for). It was also a culture shock because my colleagues bring work home and are still replying emails at 12am. Submissions (papers, etc) can be &gt; 5000 words long. 

I have been in my new role for 2 months and I feel that many Humanities majors have a very romanticized view of policy-making. I was a pol sci/History major, and while we did have policy-making exercises, it was pretty much watered down on hindsight. Policy-making requires much more than writing. It entails liaising with lawyers who may write in a style which is difficult to comprehend and/or use terms which only those with legal background would know. It also requires many levels of discussions and even people management and it isn’t as sexy as what we thought it would be. It is also very cerebral and for the first few weeks I just feel very stupid (actually until now also but slowing getting the hang of it). 

I am facing a very steep learning curve now, especially since I had mentioned about my rusty writing and reading skills. Don’t get me wrong, I feel proud of what I am doing and I don’t intend to quit anytime soon. I have things to learn and opportunities to pursue in this role. I am thankful and want to comtribute. But its just that I am facing a great deal of anxiety and doubt over whether I can surmount the steep learning curve and the challenges, as well as actually delivering what I am supposed to deliver. I don’t want to drag my colleagues down (they are lawyers and Oxford grads by the way, abit intimidated because they are way above my league haha) and I certainly do not want to cause my boss to feel that she regrets hiring me. 

Just wanted to ask fellow Singaporean redditors who have switched careers - is this a new job kind of feeling? How long did you take to acclimatize to the demands of your new job in a new field? Also, there appears to be several differences between stat boards and ministries in general - and I have heard of a few such as different pace of work- so what are the other differences? 

Tldr: new job which I am thankful for, but finding it difficult to adapt and feels stupid.

14,singapore,236948,Dealing with a toxic parent during CB period,gobm40,Vladioska,1590117795,26,1,"  Hi guys I was really hesitant to post this here because I wasn't sure if this was the right platform to seek advice but I'm running out of options.  

  Well, to give some context, my mother and I have had a rocky relationship. It's been tough living in this house with her due to her oppressive nature. She's prone to throwing fits and picking fights with not just me but my father and older sister too.  I have clashed with her on several occasions and they always turn into shouting matches that leave me utterly exhausted and broken. Most of the time, I'm forced to retreat to my room and bawl my eyes out before she can even listen to reason. 

  She's an extremely stubborn individual who has to be right in every argument, regardless of who her opponent is. Before CB, she was already cooped up at home all the time due to her job which could have contributed to her mood swings. But, she could at least go out during the weekends or no one would be around for most of the day for her to vent her anger on. Now, we are all stuck in this decrepit hellhole together and she's driving me mad. 

  Initially, she agreed to pay my poly fees for me which made me genuinely appreciative of her. And I was also looking forward to going to campus. Then, news of Covid-19 and CB appeared,effectively rendering me stranded at home with her.  Yesterday, she suddenly sprang the news on me that I had to pay half when I start to work. This would have been fine if she didn't agree to pay for me in the first place. An argument ensued and she just would not back down and admit she backed down on her word,citing that she is doing this so that I will work. However, all I have been doing is studying in my room in a bid to avoid her. And she is fully aware of that and she even called me crazy for studying so much. After I brought this up, she tried to change topic and cited that it was a way of teaching me the value of money. The argument grew more ferocious to the point when I just told her she was driving me mad and she had the gall of retorting with ""I'm the one who's going mad"". This was the last straw for me.

  I've tried talking to her and asking her to change. We even sat down as a family to talk to her. Nothing has worked. I'm thinking of leaving the house and going somewhere else to stay  for a while to get away from her. But, I don't have anyone from my family to turn to as they would most likely send me back to live with her in spite of my protests. And my dad doesn't allow me to leave either despite how much of a tyrant she is. My best bet is to move to my best friend's house but I'm not allowed to due to the CB measures in place right now. So, I'm really at a loss and decided to write here to vent and to ask for advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gobm40/dealing_with_a_toxic_parent_during_cb_period/,1.0,"[""No one is stopping you from taking strolls around, well technically you could argue it is non-essential but I'd toss that under exercise and just take my leave.\n\nObviously make sure you social distance while out, preferably while not touching anything.""]"
15,singapore,235712,Living in isolation with major depression,gkp274,porowhale,1589605730,159,1,"In the midst of a depressive episode, I left my family and rented an apartment on the opposite side of Singapore. For once, I felt free and independent. I no longer had to tiptoe around eggshells, nor did I ever burst into tears over toxic remarks made by my family members. I could give myself some distance while working on my issues. I was able to choose the people who were allowed into my life and new home. For awhile, my life felt okay, until the announcement of the Circuit Breaker. 


In an instant, I no longer had any physical or face to face contact with my friends and loved ones. I worked from home alone behind a laptop screen, and ate takeouts for weeks. As someone who relied on social interaction and a fixed routine to deal with my mental illness, I felt ruined by the pandemic. 


I didn't leave the house, let alone my bed. Empty shelves in the supermarket meant that I survived mainly on frozen snacks. I stopped taking my antidepressants. I no longer took care of my personal hygiene. Trash and dishes piled up while I began to break down. Work became even more overwhelming than usual, and my isolation felt suffocating. 


I was aware that I could leave my house at any time to take a walk, to take a deep breath and comfort myself. As many apathetic people would tell me, ""Just stop thinking about the negative!"". But leaving the house was a goal that was too far away. Taking a step outside felt too exhausting, too much for me to handle. Leaving the house still meant that I'll be alone. I would never be able run into the arms of my loved ones. After all, we're not allowed to interact with anyone outside, and I was also 30km away from them. News broke that a relative of mine had committed suicide. No funeral or proper goodbyes could be held. 


Extensions of the circuit breaker and discussions on how long it'll take before life could get back to normal made it hard for me to breathe. Normalcy is all I hoped for, and hope was fading. I felt driven over the edge. I still am. 


Prior to the circuit breaker, I spent years in therapy. I made really good progress, and was told that I could finally graduate from my therapist at the start of this year. The pandemic left me with loose ends regarding my therapy, my relationship with my family, and progression in my life.


I can empathize with online videos on social media of people throwing furniture off buildings, of people making a scene in public. I wanted to act like a child, screaming and throwing fits in public so that I can somehow be heard. I wanted people to give in to my selfish requests. I felt angry over everyone and every country which played a part in the spread of the virus. I felt frustration over the changes I was forced to endure. 


Isolation felt like a personal attack towards me. Logic told me that I was being ridiculous, but depression told me that everything that has happened was done on purpose because I didn't deserve love and social interaction. I didn't deserve the normalcy that I desperately wanted. I am not allowed to be happy. I am not permitted good things in my life. I believe that had I not have gone through therapy, I would have already fallen apart.


To end this off, here are some of the things I've done to keep myself sane:

- Forcing myself to take a shower

 Taking a shower regularly gives me a push to take care of other parts of myself, such as skincare and dental hygiene. Rather than just showers, the more accurate term would be to create a list of 'bare minimums'. I can spend my day doing nothing, but I must at least complete my 'bare minimums' such as taking a shower, eating breakfast and taking my pills.


- Befriending myself

 Like the movie ""Inside Out"", I envision my feelings as individual components of who I am. My sadness and anger often dominates my mind, but I remind myself that these are just emotions inside of me, and not who I am as a person. I don't have to act how they want me to, I just have to acknowledge that these feelings exists.


- Mothering myself

 Similar to befriending myself, I remind myself to be kind. I am understanding of my problems, and acknowledge its existence. I am patient towards myself and celebrate small achievements like getting myself out of bed. Like a mother towards a child, I only want the best for myself, and will encourage myself gently.


- Don't suppress your emotions

 Even if you're afraid of rejection, speak to someone you trust or go to an anonymous public platform to share your thoughts and mental state. Being vulnerable opens up conversations, and may provide you with support. Writing is something that I've always found cathartic, and was also a method my therapist encouraged me to do.


Everyone is having a tough time during the pandemic. This is a known fact. You're not alone if you have depressive symptoms. It is okay to not come out of circuit breaker mastering new languages or having a summer-ready body. Those are privileges that not everyone can afford. 


Depression is equivalent to the common cold, in the realm of mental disorders. Job loss, grief, and social isolation are events that many face, and its okay to not feel okay. It is okay to be anxious and cry. But for the sake of your own mental well-being, for the sake of what is best for yourself, please keep moving no matter how paralyzing or meaningless it may feel.

I wrote this mainly to share how i've been coping with the circuit breaker, and to jot down all the thoughts that have been intruding my mind. These are things that i've been wanting to say to my boss, to my family and my friends. I try not to share my feelings with them in-depth because I don't want to cause unnecessary worry or panic. I'm more or less stable, just that it takes me time to get a hold of myself.  I hope that sharing this will at least help some people understand themselves and their loved ones better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gkp274/living_in_isolation_with_major_depression/,1.0,['This is a really brave post.

I was largely inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g6aq8h/i_have_no_words/). Don't understand the rampant virtue signaling and holier-than-thou attitude which doesn't help anyone. Everyone is badly affected by COVID so just have some empathy and let people rant and reserve judgement, even if it's not completely rational and selfish at times. Deep inside I'm sure all of us are guilty as well about feeling unhappy that our freedoms are curtailed.

Anyway I will list a few common variants of comments often seen on this sub and address them systematically.

**“Parents nowadays too reliant on childcare, maid, grandparents, etc”**

Let’s first address the reliance on caregivers. 

Fundamentally, I believe that parents cannot be reasonably expected to attend to their child’s needs while also meeting work expectations of an employee during office hours and progressing in their career. Hence, the reliance is an absolute necessity if both parents are working full-time. 

As the saying goes, “it takes a village to raise a child” and in the past, what people did was to just leave their kids with a relative or to run around in the kampung with the other kids with little care to whether they got kidnapped/gored by a wild boar/their neck broken by falling in a ditch etc. Now obviously you will see some shows where the single mother carries the baby in a bamboo basket and plucks herbs/runs some restaurant at the same time. Wow! Try doing that in your office job.

The other option is single income with one homemaker. And unfortunately it is not financially viable for the vast majority of families to subsist on a single income in Singapore (and pretty much everywhere else as well). Even a parent taking a childcare break for a few years can have a devastating effect on future income and savings and completely derail a career.

**“Nowadays parents don’t spend time with their kids and outsource everything. They will be neglected and become degenerates in the future”**

This is related to the first point, the outsourcing part has been addressed. I think the main overgeneralization is that parents who want their kids out of their face during office hours are going to continue ignoring their kids after that. Yes, there are a number of parents like that but there are also a lot of parents who are happy to play with their kids at the end of the day. Research has shown that quality time is important to children and not absolute quantity ([https://hbr.org/2018/11/how-our-careers-affect-our-children](https://hbr.org/2018/11/how-our-careers-affect-our-children)).

Also, in my experience the vast majority of the neglected kids act out during school years but eventually most still grow up to be economically productive (if psychologically unhealthy) citizens.The roots of this problem lie deeper, I personally feel that Singapore has a strong culture of toxic shame which has been passed down from generation to generation, leading to poor psychological health at a population level and thus people who are less well equipped to be parents in general.

But no society is not going to collapse, especially considering how many from our generation are /r/raisedbynarcissists and we are still doing fine.

**“Why have kids if you don’t want to take care of them so irresponsible tsk tsk tsk”**

The issue here is that for parents who are WFH during the CB you are expected to both care for the kid at home while performing 100% of your regular work duties (unless your company is ‘understanding’). So that is essentially a +50% burden with 2 parents WFH and +100% if one parent is essential and working away from home. Also, childcare centres were still charging 100% fees during CB which was only recently cut by 50% due to government intervention.

IMO this statement is the equivalent of “Why work in F&amp;B if you don’t want to take a pay cut and work 50% more hours”, “Why work in healthcare if you don’t want to have extended hours, leave cancellation, elevated COVID risk”, “Why work as a taxi driver if you don’t want to take 90% paycut”. Everyone didn’t sign up for this shit but I’m sure we all recognize these statements are insensitive so how about applying the same standard to WFH parents?

**“If your kids cannot keep themselves entertained and you cannot perform WFH at your regular capacity you are a terrible parent“**

Kids above 6 might be (semi) independent but those 2+-5 need constant attention (unless watching iPad the whole day) and those under that need constant supervision before they kill themselves in the 5-10 seconds you look away. It can be extremely challenging and stressful to juggle these duties and work at the same time (not to mention securing food, housework, etc especially those who don’t have a helper).

**“Parents nowadays have kids as an insurance policy when they are old”**

I seriously LOL every time I see an argument like that. Certainly there are boomers that treat their kids like an ATM but the idea that financially pragmatic young Singaporeans would dump immense sums of money into an investment with the hope that it will pay some dividend scraps 30 years down the road is just laughable, you are better off dumping it into an ILP or the altcoin/shitcoin flavor of the month.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g6fqij/addressing_common_criticisms_directed_at_young/,0.0,['You are wasting your time dude here.

I'm 16 this year in jc and things in school are alright I guess. Never kept a social life so there's that. Always fancied myself as a line wolf and shit, I wrote on this sub on how I was coping with bipolar a month ago, you can choose to check if out 

https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gkv6j1/how_im_coping_ib_cb_as_a_16_yo_with_bipolar/

I've always had issues at home tbh. My parents marriage haven't been smooth sailing from the start and I don't even know whether they love each other, tbh (was arranged marriage,20 plus yrs ago) so they always never talked and my dad spends more time talking to his sister on the phone whether its coming home or at home.at home they are frequented with arguments and I personally am not fond of my dad. He has no communication skills, always embarrassing me and if I say smtg that he cld improve on he will blast at me at how he's providing for me and im complaining like unthankful bastard.

Ironic that this is happening on the day it shldnt, always felt I was missing out on so many things as a family. We never had a family holiday since 2013, only showing our dynamic as a family.

And then theres my mum with bullshit everyday which has no scientific evidience (like arguments everyday over things I did. This is one example(no I am not giving an extreme example of things that she said, because then I'm lying here.) Once, she said that walking by the bin will get u the coronavirus, because I walked past by a bin (the large one) otw to the MRT because that way Is a faster way to go to the MRT. This has happened so many times over past 4 years with all the bs I get put on my plate,dk where the fake news is even coming from.

I feel like I hit my breaking point already, rn, I just wanna go and do well for As next yr hopefully, I rather be in Tekong than live at home (fuck me the library's not open yet) then rent a room and earn money on the side and live alone.

I love being alone , like rn I left my room and put my table in the varanda. All I can say is shits hit the roof on my end. And I guess I need someone to talk to 

I feel like i've went through alot of shit since young and never had much happy memories as a person(no I'm not emo rn, just purely exhausted from everything that's happening, feel like a cunt rn as well cus im not bothered whatever that is happening in the world rn and using this platform to rant. But again i feel things cld have gone much better on my end. (If you read all the way till here, thank you for wasting your time reading about how I'm feeling,but I appreciate it - I feel alone alone all the time (many of my classmates in sec school - always asked me why i always looked solemn,noone knew about my bipolar,cus I was scared that I wld be bullied because of it).

19,singapore,242306,Will Covid-19 End Toxic Behaviour Towards LGBTQ and Racial Minorities at Uni Orientation Camps?,haq9cf,kahninah,1592397273,1,1,,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-covid-19-toxic-behaviour-lgbtq-racial-minorities-uni-orientation-camps/,1.0,"['&gt; # Will Covid-19 End Toxic Behaviour Towards LGBTQ &amp; Racial Minorities At Uni Orientation Camps?\n\n&gt; 15 Jun 2020\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Top image: Youth.sg\n\n&gt; With universities moving orientation camps online, many freshmen—also known freshies—may be disappointed to miss out on what’s often seen as an iconic university experience. After all, you can’t replicate the feeling of orientation games, pageants, or late night suppers via Zoom.\n\n&gt; There may be a silver lining to all of this, however. Online orientation greatly lowers the chance of you being asked to re-enact a brother-sister rape scene. You are also less likely to encounter some of the racist and homophobic elements of orientation camps previous batches of students have.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; “Purple Is for Homosexual”\n\n&gt; Take the “traffic light” game, an icebreaker where freshies are asked to go in a circle and share their relationship status with a colour. Red for attached, green for single, yellow for “it’s complicated.”\n\n&gt; An additional rule that Chloe*, a Year One student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), did not expect to hear at their Tembusu College camp was, “Purple is for homosexual.”\n\n&gt; The game is played at multiple universities here. Alexandra*, a student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), said that the rule at her faculty orientation camp was, “If you’re not normal, say you’re black.”\n\n&gt; “I had to ask my other friend, what do you mean by not normal?”\n\n&gt; There are some signs that universities have tried to clamp down on this activity, albeit not very successfully. In an assessment NUS orientation group leaders were required to take, the activity is mentioned by name, as reported by The New Paper in 2018: “If a group of university orientation camp freshmen decide to play the “traffic light” game, where participants must declare their relationship status, what should the camp leader do?”\n\n&gt; The scenario makes no mention of the rule that may apply to LGBTQ students.\n\n&gt; Chloe shared their surprise that the game was played at Tembusu, as they had heard the residential college was “more inclusive”. \n\n&gt; “If I went to a [non-Tembusu College] orientation I would probably not be surprised, because there’s so many horror stories around this already,” she tells me.\n\n&gt; “But I thought Tembusu would be different.”\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Racial Slurs and Predominantly-Chinese Cheers \n\n&gt; At one of my own freshman orientation camps last year, my group leaders taught us a cheer containing a racial slur that referenced individuals of Indian ethnicity. \n\n&gt; When we came to that word, I thought I could feel a wave of discomfort ripple through the group. The group leaders were quick to remind us that we did not have to do the cheer if any of us were uncomfortable with it, something they did consistently before every camp activity.\n\n&gt; We ended up not performing the cheer, but I was struck by one group leader’s defensive comment—that the slur in question was “just a word” Chinese people hd made up to make fun of the Indian community.\n\n&gt; Her comment shocked me almost more than the cheer. Call me sheltered, but I had not known there were people my age who legitimately found it okay to use that term, and mere weeks after the Preetipls incident had sparked a polarised discussion about race and privilege in Singapore.\n\n&gt; I wondered why the group leaders could not have omitted the cheer in the first place, instead of putting the onus on the freshies to voice their discomfort, where they may feel pressured to go with the flow.\n\n&gt; Then there are the orientation camp activities that are less overtly discriminatory, but still serve to exclude minorities.\n\n&gt; Bryan*, a Year 4 student at NTU, described his freshman orientation camp as a “culture shock” due to the cheers being predominantly in Mandarin and Hokkien, though only some of the Chinese freshies seemed perturbed by it. \n\n&gt; “Most of them just accepted it as part of the majority.”\n\n&gt; Since Bryan speaks Mandarin, the language barrier did not affect him as much as other non-Chinese students like Alexandra, who found it “very hard to memorise the lyrics and chant it along with the rest of the group.”\n\n&gt; She also found it difficult to “gel with the group” as many students carried out conversations in Mandarin, to the exclusion of non-Chinese speakers.\n\n&gt; When one of Alexandra’s groupmates noticed her struggling to follow along, she said he “basically just told me, to my face, that this is the norm, you kind of have to just suck it up. He didn’t use those words, but with his tone and everything, that’s what I got out of it.”\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Will Covid-19 Break the Cycle?\n\n&gt; When I asked the students I interviewed for this article—all of whom opted to go by a pseudonym—if they had considered reporting the incidents to their universities, none of them said they had.\n\n&gt; Some were unaware of how to do so, and most expressed doubt that it would lead to any substantial change. After all, as this reporter for The New Paper pointed out in 2016, sexualised university orientation games had made the news as far back as 2006, “Yet, a decade on, nothing has changed.”\n\n&gt; Some students are still trying, though. As part of a student organisation that hosts orientation camps, Bryan and other students in NTU have been working to make orientation camps more inclusive.\n\n&gt; Covid-19 may present another opportunity. As stories of inappropriate orientation games hit the headlines year after year, social media and local internet forums always seem to return to the argument that orientation camps are prone to adverse selection. The idea is that the juniors who enjoyed the problematic aspects of camp, or at least were less disturbed by it, are more likely to return as seniors the next year and repeat what they saw as freshmen.\n\n&gt; It would then follow that this year’s virtual orientation, devoid of physical games or camp cheers, could help reset people’s expectations of what Orientation camps should be like. \n\n&gt; Or at least, one can dream. \n\n&gt; Seniors from higher batches tend to be involved in leadership roles at camps, and orientation games and cheers live on in collective memory and previous years’ camp proposals. \n\n&gt; And while intervention by universities might put a stop to overt discrimination such as the use racial slurs, it does not address the discomfort minority students experience due to casually racist attitudes and microaggressions by other students. After all, it is not only at university orientation camps that we see Chinese people speaking in Mandarin when racial minorities are present.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; For Alexandra, what made her orientation experience uncomfortable wasn’t any one activity specifically. Rather, it was “the small moments, that when you put together was kind of a scary experience for someone who is queer or someone who is an ethnic minority.”\n\n&gt; Students also don’t need an activity with inherently problematic elements to make things uncomfortable for minorities.\n\n&gt; Chloe shared that one orientation game, Red-Black, was used to ask speculative questions about students’ sexual orientation and gender identity. In the game, freshies take turns to ask a question, and the group votes for a member of the group to answer by pointing at the person.\n\n&gt; When her group leader asked a question related to gender identity during the game, Chloe felt that it was “like everyone is accusing you of being trans by pointing.”\n\n&gt; “Anyone who looks or seems gay or trans, would be more likely to get pointed at. And it’s just a really nasty experience. I cannot imagine if I was actually trans, and that was the same scenario, how I would have felt.”\n\n&gt; Making orientation inclusive to all students is not just a matter of removing certain inappropriate activities. It requires all of us to grapple with discriminatory attitudes across local campuses and in Singapore society in general.\n\n&gt; It requires universities to take their policies on discrimination on the basis of traits like national origin, religion, ethnicity, gender—and in NTU’s case, sexual orientation—outlined in their Student Codes of Conduct seriously.\n\n&gt; Until then, this year’s orientation camps will simply be, like so many things this year, the exception. And next year’s camp leaders will be back to asking freshies if they are red, yellow, green, or black.\n\n&gt; *Pseudonyms used to protect privacy.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Have you experienced microaggressions that no one seems to talk about?

By being kinder to our bodies, we take care of our mental health too.\n\n&gt; SINGAPORE: I love going to the gym as much as the next normal person — which is to say, I couldn’t think of a worse punishment.\n\n&gt; But I willingly put myself through the torture.\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; It started in my mid-twenties when I hauled myself to the gym regularly. From monthly packages at high-intensity interval training gyms to occasional classes at boutique boxing gyms, I happily left home before dawn to pump myself with enough endorphins before tackling my to-do list at work.\n\n&gt; There was nothing that motivated me like getting sweaty in the company of others who found equal pleasure in suffering together — and the collective guilt of having already forked out an exorbitant amount for a membership.\n\n&gt; Never mind that chaining myself to machines in a pungent space with perspiring strangers felt disturbingly dystopian, especially since I’d head straight to another slavish factory to do work on another machine after my hour-long gym session to earn enough money so I could persist with this routine relentlessly each week\n\n&gt; Along with the simultaneous proliferation of gyms, yoga studios, indoor cycling studios and other similar fitness centres, I was officially sucked into the cult of fitness.\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Thanks to COVID-19, the circuit breaker has put a dampener on my gym regime for the near future.\n\n&gt; Singapore aims to allow retail, dining-in and fitness facilities to resume business under plans to lift more restrictions in Phase 2. That could come as early as end-June but it’s hard to see how gyms will resume business as usual after the circuit breaker lifts, since customers share the same equipment in small places.\n\n&gt; Frankly, I’m in no rush to return.\n\n&gt; (Photo: Unsplash/rawpixel)\n\n&gt; SAVE GYMS, BUT DITCH GYM CULTURE\n\n&gt; Much has been said about how the pandemic has exposed certain structural issues and problems stewing beneath the facade of our pristine national image, from the lack of digital literacy in lower-income households to poor living conditions for migrant workers.\n\n&gt; Similarly, on an individual level, the sudden absence of gyms and fitness studios, coupled with the security of distance and the power of 20/20 hindsight, have got me thinking about the more insidious reasons I was previously addicted to religiously patronising them.\n\n&gt; While I did strive to be healthy, I also bought into the glamorised gym culture that focused on a specific ideal of wellness — one that probably placed more value on looking good than inner well-being.\n\n&gt; Like many gym goers I suspect, I would visit the gym partly because I was committed to “self-optimisation”. I wanted to perfect the ultimate “fitspo” lifestyle and become the proverbial woman who “has it all”.\n\n&gt; I would blame peer pressure. After all, I felt accountable to those crossfit classmates who would surely notice if I didn’t turn up every week.\n\n&gt; But a lot of the tension was from within. I’d already sunk a huge sum of money on that annual gym membership, surely I couldn’t let that go to waste? Worse still, I wouldn’t want to send the message that I don’t take my health seriously.\n\n&gt; And it wasn’t enough that I led a healthy lifestyle, I had to look the part. I was excessively self-conscious about displaying flawless form in the gym, in case other seasoned gym goers were watching.\n\n&gt; Outside the gym, I would plan my meals so stringent that counting calories became second nature. When I looked at my medium-rare ribeye, all I could see were the kilometres I had to run off. Whenever I indulged in fast food, I would castigate myself and swear to work doubly hard the next day as penance.\n\n&gt; Convinced this obsessive practice was only making me fitter, leaner, toner, and ultimately the much better person I aspired to be, I continued hacking away like a maniacal energizer bunny.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; But being away from the gym for several months due to COVID-19 helped me realise the performative aspects of gym culture don’t exist in a vacuum.\n\n&gt; Trainer Wang Kai teaches a class that is being livestreamed at a gym, as the country is hit by an outbreak of the new coronavirus, in Beijing, China, on Feb 14, 2020.

Along the same vein, presenteeism in the Singaporean workplace regards employees working till 11pm as hardworking models worth emulating.\n\n&gt; When it comes to physical fitness, this culture of hyperproductivity translates into extreme image consciousness. We think it’s only natural to work out in order to fit into society’s conventional standards of physical beauty.\n\n&gt; Unfortunately, when our interests are mainly built on external factors, such as having to show up at a physical gym or rely on the attention and validation of fellow fitness fanatics to feel good, there is little intrinsic motivation to continue once these external factors cease to exist.\n\n&gt; It is why, I suspect, many people possess pricey memberships that collect dust after only being used for a few gym sessions — just one reminder that the pressure to perform in a certain way seemingly crucial to your identity can make you squander unnecessary money or even affect your mental wellbeing.\n\n&gt; A MORE MINDFUL MODEL OF PHYSICAL WELLNESS\n\n&gt; Since the circuit breaker kicked in, the curious thing is my workout sessions have gotten more sparse and erratic, ranging from twice a day to once a fortnight.\n\n&gt; Yet, I don’t feel an ounce of guilt for “slacking”.\n\n&gt; (Photo: Mimi Thian/ Unsplash)\n\n&gt; This period of compulsory downtime has stripped us of life’s frills. When everyone is simply trying to cope with perennial anxiety and fatigue over an uncertain future, prioritising being in tip-top shape suddenly seems trivial in comparison.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; These days, I do what I can with what I have, based on what feels good for myself. That means turning down all invites to Zoom workout sessions for a start. Otherwise, I’d merely be replacing one performance in the gym for another in my home to a live digital audience.\n\n&gt; I exercise within the parameters of my room, which usually entails having YouTube fitness gurus scream at me to “push through” because “no pain, no gain”. And I allow myself to collapse wheezing after barely 20 minutes or hit pause on a strenuous workout without any shame.\n\n&gt; Alternatively, I jog around my neighbourhood when I conjure enough self-discipline to overcome my inertia and cabin fever, taking in the fresh air and limitless personal space that a gym lacks\n\n&gt; And instead of punishing myself for indulging in sinful foods, I look at the possible stressors that compel me to indulge in the first place, then tackle them.\n\n&gt; I understand gym rats who yearn to work out with a like-minded community again. I, too, occasionally miss the enforced discipline of exercising in a gym.\n\n&gt; But we shouldn’t squander the opportunities that COVID-19 has granted us to question longstanding ways of living.\n\n&gt; We can no longer ignore the bigger conversation that needs to happen about how gym culture affects both physical and mental well-being. Let’s start with dismantling the pernicious culture of fitness, where self-image, identity, and productivity feel so enmeshed, the desire to stay fit became a toxic obsession.\n\n&gt; If we do return to the gym, we must develop a healthier relationship with our bodies independent from what society or the mirror in the gym tell us.\n\n&gt; Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n\n&gt; Grace Yeoh is a senior journalist at CNA Insider.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"
23,singapore,239932,Clarification for some questions for BMT.,gxor4r,DatOtakuxD,1591440225,19,1,"Oh look, yet another bmt query post. I'm due to enlist next year, and ive been reading some posts every now and then to get a general feel to prepare myself for it, even though I should still focus on school, LMAO. I have a few questions however, that (I think) have not been asked often.

1. I intend to set up a 'display set' of sorts for my locker during bmt so I dont have to panic about keeping everything orderly each time I take something out. What are the full, exact items that should be displayed (so i can bring in an extra set)? Please avoid saying ""basic toiletries"", since it doesnt really help clarifying exactly what should be brought.

2. I've been reading on how health and safety is stressed but then when you report sick you are seen as trying to chao keng. If I happen to get a toxic PS or MO (touchwood), is it worth to try and assert that I am not well (ie asking if he is responsible for anything that happens)? Im thinking that its very likely I will be marked becaused of that. I want to avoid reporting them up the chain of command, since from reading some posts nothing is going to happen anyway.

3. During confinement, are weekends treated the same as any other weekday in bmt?

4. Are meal times technically treated as admin time, where after eating you can return to your bunk to rest?

5. How strict are the superiors on sleeping after lights out? Lets say you needed the toilet at like maybe 22 45 ish, shortly after lights out at 22 30.


Others that are less impt:
are laundry bar soaps better than powder detergent in terms of efficiency?
Is applying sunblock everyday recommended? If so, what brands you suggest?
Does baby powder help as a quick way of getting rid of the smell of sweat or body odour?

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gxor4r/clarification_for_some_questions_for_bmt/,1.0,"[""Report sick if you need. MOs will not shame you for that (unless you are really malingering) since its their job as doctors to attend to you.\n\nThe toxic shaming of 'chao keng' recruits comes more from other recruits in your bunk / plt. But then again if you are reporting sick for genuine issues then it is unlikely that they will shame you for that.\n\nFor admin time/lights off timing and other disciplinary issues it varies from company to company. Some enforce strictly (sch 2 and mono has it worse) while others are more lax.\n\nFor body ordour its not rlly an issue since everyone smells bad.\n\nPacking list will be given so not to worry.

24,singapore,239127,Abusive/toxic Boss?,gv4ad2,Darkgun9,1591090869,121,1," So my boss just called me today, to report back to office in less than 2 hours to have a short meeting.

The appeal to return to work in phase one for my company was rejected btw.

Me: no , I'm not going to return to the office and break the law.

Boss: take it as ""picking up something"" ""its just a short meeting"" .

Me: its still breaking the law .

She laughed/giggled, like something inbetween not loud but not soft .

Me: its not funny and I'm not going to break the law. Can it be done over zoom?

She said can.

Me: Then you should have thought about this first before asking me to break the law, its not funny (again, since she didn't stop giggling)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had a zoom meeting with the staff involved afterwards. The contents of the meeting involve me doing things out of my jobscope. The staff mentioned that since ""we were stuck at home"" they figured we had more time to help. I barely could help myself with my workload btw. So I rejected it. I'm not helping if I can't help myself - at the end KPI matters the most when the axe falls.

For me WFH gave the company a chance to abuse our working hours and made us clear leave - yet asking us what is our plan to work during our leave. Questioning us about our low output of work during leave and threatening our job security.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TLDR - Boss nonchalantly asked me to break the law for a short meeting, turns out the purpose is to make me do extra work out of my jobscope. I can't even handle my own workload.

26,singapore,256237,Anyone has any advice to deal with an emotionally abusive elderly in the family?,i400d0,fluffysilvs,1596607739,14,1,"I am at my wits’ end. She [82f] makes the lives of everyone around her difficult, even my neighbours’. She has unhealthy habits like smoking and gambling, but doesn’t care for the physical health of others. My neighbours have filed many complains against her smoking habits. She smokes in her room sometimes but the smoke gets out through the windows to the corridor (since her room faces the corridor). She also smokes in the balcony but doesn’t bother closing the door or turning on the air purifier (specially bought for her) and scolds us when we attempt to close the door on her. She seems to think that smoke cannot emit throughout the house and only goes one way (out of the window) no matter the number of times other relatives have told this to her. She still smokes in her room despite receiving warnings from HDB. She’s also very emotionally abusive towards my Mother and I and finds things to yell at us about on a daily basis, calls us names, curses at us saying that we will suffer, tells us that bad things will befall on us, says that we are evil, picks at our emotional wounds. She’s even borderline physically abusive, has attempted to hit me before and has also threatened to get her male (elderly too i presume) friends to come and beat me up. On top of that, she has threatened suicide, self-harm as well as burning down the whole house along with us. I have contacted FSC but all they seem to be able to offer me are counselling services and no concrete action. They also just tell me to call the Police whenever she makes a threat. No one has been sent down so far from their end to assess her mental health nor talk to her about her toxic behaviour. I don’t find calling the police effective. I tried once, all they did was come down, assess the situation, tell us that it’s a family dispute and that they have no hand in this. The paramedics also told us that she has no mental health condition and thus can’t bring her in for a check. (They made the assumption on the fact that she was lucid and could respond to questions, which confuses me because there’s a wide spectrum of mental disorders) It’ll be impossible to bring her in for a check-up too because she definitely won’t come with us. She’s been coughing for months now but has refused to visit the Doctor’s because she (1) doesn’t want to get a swab test (2) doesn’t want to end up in the hospital and (3) probably knows that it’s linked to her smoking habits but she won’t hear any of it.

Any advice would be appreciated. Sending her to an elderly care centre is not an option in my family’s books because my mother is too soft-hearted and doesn’t want to. In fact, she keeps getting bullied by my grandmother and barely ever stands up for herself. Is there any way I can get authorities in (legit ones that can actually provide support) or even legal recourse?

28,singapore,253748,Reflection about GE 2020,hx9dth,WorkingBenefit,1595622441,10,0,"As a swing voter (or a moderate I guess), I voted for the WP and it has overall been an interesting election. Aside from some of the fiasco that happened between different parties, I was pretty impressed by how engaged people were in this election, compared to previous GEs. I was overseas in 2015 and apparently there were strong political sentiment during that time (especially online), but even at that time it seemed that people were just feeling very strongly about their opinions and PAP bashing just happened to be more popular than before (or at least, has become more vocal.)

Whereas in this GE, I noticed more active discussions regarding politics and the campaigns from all the parties have become more diversified like how social media has been utilized more. One can argue that this is due to covid-19 deterring public rallies from taking place, but even then I feel it wouldn't be hard to ignore these campaigns considering how vast the internet is (especially with the younger generation who would be expected to be less interested in politics than people older than them.) But I was honestly pleasantly surprised. No matter if I agree or disagree with a persons' opinions, I do think this is a sign of our society maturing, being more forward thinking and involved in how we want our country to be run, which I'm quite proud of. It also disproves perceptions of us being victims of self-censorship (which I'm not denying has been a thing in the past, it just seems less so now seeing how commonplace politics have been in conversations even within the younger generation.)

However, as someone who has voted for an opposition party, I have to say I'm perplexed by how toxic opposition supporters can be. Not saying PAP supporters are any better, but I find it ironic that all the criticisms targeted towards the PAP (like turning their politicians into cringey social media trends, inflexibility towards other perspectives and views, bashing other parties just for the sake of it, etc) are also being enacted by opposition supporters (the whole oppa Jamus thing and people calling Chee Soon Juan and Tan Cheng Bock ""hypebeasts"" being such examples.) I find opposition supporters to just shut down any opinions that talk positively of the PAP and bash them for doing so. Some even just support opposition because they don't like the PAP without giving much thought about the actual policies of the particular party they are voting for, which is just really polarising and not much better than some PAP voters who vote for them just because they assume all opposition parties are not as good as the PAP.

I think this polarisation comes from this view of parties being framed as ""PAP vs Opposition parties"", which I don't think is a healthy way to approach politics. As these parties do fundamentally defer from one other (to certain degrees) and coating over a group of parties under the same brush could lead to some thinking that if I support one opposition party meaning that would support the other opposition parties as well. Which isn't always the case.

Personally, I don't hate the PAP and I don't want them to barred from parliament (the same way I don't want the same for any party.) In fact, I still think they are overall pretty component than not just to surrounding countries, but even compared to other developed countries (this is coming from a person who has had spent quite a lot of time living overseas.) I just think they should be a credible alternative voice in parliament and I feel that the WP have pretty well planned out proposals for policies that I can see being implemented in sg, whereas the PAP is more concentrated on maintaining status quo and the vision the other parties like the SDP and the PSP have seem too idealistic to me. I supported the WP because I believed them to be the party that represent my views the best, not because I despise the PAP. Plus, having a one party parliament wouldn't be at all good for the country in the future, no matter how component they are.

Does anyone think similar to me? Agree? Disagree?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hx9dth/reflection_about_ge_2020/,0.33,"[""I think you feel the same way as Inderjit Singh.

31,singapore,250066,“Is this a repudiation of the political culture of bullying?” - well-written afterthought on the election by Thio Shen Yi from TSMP law firm,hp79mg,Newez,1594459979,26,1,"From Thio Shen Yi FB account:

Is this a repudiation of the political culture of bullying?  

Is it my imagination, or did the WP, of all parties, take the high road? No smears, no attacks.  Grace, humility and ability to apologise and learn, and a listening ear. 

Some of the PAPs candidates are magnificent. PM, Tharman, Nadia Samdin(disclosure- colleague alert- congrats!). Lawrence Wong has had a good run, Chuan Jin and Iswaran show themselves to be gracious and gentlemanly, Indranee is a charm offensive unto herself and able to change minds through a combination of logic and more importantly, empathy. Tin Pei Ling and Patrick Tay clearly work the ground and win hearts and minds. Some PAP names are still untested or not well known to me, or are perceived to not listen, or to be arrogant and mean spirited. 

The PAP run a country well. They run a campaign terribly (a shout-out to Stef for stealing her line). My two cents worth:

1. You are the majority- take the high road. People expect it. You are held to a different standard. That is neither illogical, illegal or unfair. Dominance has its responsibilities (like Competition Law). 

2. Stop bullying candidates. Stop attacking them. Play the ball, not the man. Trust us to distinguish between good and bad ideas. We don’t like to see those in power beat up those outside looking in. Support for the underdog resides in all our hearts.

3. Be humble. I never saw a response to AWARE’s objection to a rather tasteless analogy about the wife beater analogy. Learn to apologise. People respect that. You will say something tone deaf or offensive. It is inevitable in the heat of the moment. You will get called out. Walk it back. Don’t double down. Say sorry. Express regret. We respect that, and that humility wins us over.  

4. Don’t insult us. Our feelings, our intelligence or our aspirations. “Don’t worry about voting in all 93 PAP MPs - there will be 12 NCMP seats to ensure representation”. That is neither convincing or persuasive. Some see an NCMP, and there is a “loser” sign on their forehead. That is not what legitimacy looks like. Don’t tell us “own self check own self” works. That would be unacceptable in almost any form of organised public activity or corporate life. Why would we accept that in political life, where the stakes are the highest? 

5. Understand what we want. We want you to run the show.  But you clearly don’t need 100% of the seats to do that. You could run this country effectively if you lost 25 seats. You’d have 68 seats. Yes, you would have lost some talent.  That forces you to partner and co-opt more ideas, you need to foster inclusivity, and encourage an active citizenry to step up. Groupthink is checked. You have to kick around ideas more- even consult your political opponents! But would that be so bad? 

6. Don’t fearmonger.  The LKY playbook is antiquated. Strategies for a time when the stakes were existential. It worked then, it is toxic today. We can survive because your predecessors have built a strong Singapore and a strong people. We have talent, energy and passion all around us. It just needs channeling by appealing to a collective stakeholdership, a real sense of ownership, and a solidarity or purpose. It’s there. If you think it isn’t then the last 50 years are a failed experiment where we have sowed the seed of failure even in our success. Reject that. Choose to believe we are better. 

7. Be scrupulous in designing a fair playing field. Again, we aren’t stupid. We can see when things are not fair. The desire for fairness is a psychological default. Many won’t speak out- speaking truth to power is fraught with hazard. But resentment will build up. It’s more than a lost vote. It’s more than a civilised disagreement. Resentment means a disengagement of the citizen, a division of the soul and a rebellion of the heart against you. Why encourage that? 

8. Fight bad ideas with good ideas. Fight falsehood with truth. Don’t rely on over inclusive tools like POFMA (or other statutes). That’s using a flamethrower against an ant. Even where there is falsehood, have a sense of proportion. Some falsehoods are truly egregious, and truly dangerous. Others are more debatable, and still more others are marginal and will get lost in the noise of  the hustings and excreted in the wake of information overload. Overuse, asymmetrical use, and disproportionate use of POFMA irritates the neutral observer and is a deep condescension to our intelligence. 

9. Think better of us. When you tell us that Singaporean’s are not really for a non Chinese PM, what is the basis for that?  Do you have a poll? Or is it anecdotal? It feels that you are impugning our moral sense with a racism that isn’t substantively there. Yes, humans are tribal, but after 50 years, do you not think we can rise above that.  Have you so little faith in the better angels of our nature? Maybe you do, but why default to it?  
Require better of us. And what does it cost you? A few votes from older Chinese voters ( assuming that that is even true)?  You may win over other voters with your openness and inclusiveness. When did doing what is right, even though it is not popular, stop you? 

You are trying to win hearts and minds. So it goes beyond logic. Legitimacy is built from emotional capital. It is not only about performance (what that looks like is another discussion!). Fairness, credibility, loyalty, passion, aspiration, understanding, unity, authenticity, warmth, respect, inclusiveness. Build on that.

37,singapore,264726,Reflections on free-ridership and hopes for Singapore,io11cg,windiven,1599453635,33,1," I just need to say something about the free-rider issue that PM Lee said that has been festering inside me for a while. 

The 'free-riding' thing is about the services/benefits/order that the PAP government brings about. You can vote for the opposition and still enjoy all the benefits that a PAP government brings. But that is not the point of PM Lee's statement, he was talking about people who voted for the opposition and yet fully wanted the PAP to form the government for various reasons (want PAP to 'work harder for them', etc), and how that kind of mindset isn't sustainable - people cannot vote for the opposition and expect PAP to form government in the long run. However, whether that is a good thing or a bad thing, how people should vote, is not the point of this post either. I just wanted to make a clarification for all those who only knew that PM made a 'free-rider' comment.

I find the state of politics worrying, with how divided people have become, and how strongly some people associate themselves with either side of the political spectrum. It is toxic for society to have people hating on/seeing the worst in whatever the opposing party does, just because you identify with one party. Jamus Lim (as much as I like and support his presence in parliament) isn't a hero fighting against tyranny; there is no villain to begin with. It was never a question of 'should we help \_\_\_?', but 'how do we help \_\_\_?'. PAP believes that PWM is the best way to help, and WP believes that minimum wage is the best way, and there are tradeoffs for each policy. We don't know what would be best, but it is a great and healthy discussion to have. What is not healthy are those who paint the opposition as the heroic underdog fighting to free those who are suffering from tyrants, and once the tyrants are removed all our problems will be solved. They will not be solved, and that is purely toxic. Like what Tharman has said, 'nobody has a monopoly on compassion'.

I think I just find it unjust that PAP is receiving all this negativity. Sure, there are always ways to do better, always more ways to help, but by no measure have they done a bad job, and they deserve my gratitude for all that they have done so far. Due credit must also be given to WP for fulfilling their role as opposition to questioning/challenging PAP on their policies.

40,singapore,262940,Does the 'I told you so' culture in Singapore exist?,ijvzk7,angmohgao,1598872063,33,1,"Some context:

Recently, I witnessed a grabfood deliverer encountering a 'near-miss' when he was cycling on the pavement. He was looking at his phone that was mounted in front of him on his bike and almost rode onto the road (which was empty thankfully) but managed to swerve back to safety. A passing Singaporean male around his 40s-50s saw this as well and made a comment in Chinese using a 'i know it all' tone while wagging his index finger at him :  '你们年轻人都一样的，一直看电话,最好是被车撞才懂'(you youngsters are all the same, keep looking at your phone, wait till you kena bang by car then u will learn). The grabfood cyclist scooted off after shouting back at him to mind his own business and to keep his mouth shut if he doesn't have anything better to say. The man was obviously enraged but it was also apparent that he thought that he had every right to give a dressing down to the cyclist.

This got me thinking of several personal incidents that happened to me when I was young up till today. A few years back I accidentally dropped a tray of food in a food court because the tray was really slippery and had lost all its non-slip function. No one came to help (I did not expect any either) but some aunties who were having their meal nearby made unnecessary remarks like how young people always never pay attention etc etc. 

Does this culture really exist? Or is it just me? And is it only me who feels that although sometimes its necessary to reprimand, but generally this 'i told you so' bullshit is toxic af? Doesn't it just serve to stroke the ego of the person who gives the ITYS treatment?

45,singapore,260586,My study on our current media industry and how controversies affect it's progress,iehj3v,scar_throne2901,1598099103,34,1,"Hi all, I'm a 19 yo media student and I decided to write a post about our current media industry. This post will stem from 2013 to now since I would be also talking about the rise of of some ""celebrities"" here. **NOTE: Whilst this is my study, I am also inputting some of my personal beliefs here, so please take this post with a pinch of salt. Also there will be a note for the mods at the end of the post.** 

2013 was the year where more people were opening up to the social media industry, mainly posting content that was very mainstream at that time. I think you guys would know what I'm talking about. ""Types of"" videos posted on YouTube by current established SG public figures. 

To my observation, at a lot of ""celebrities"" seem to have the image they have today because of acting in local shows, however some are self made like NOC, JH and WB. By self made, I mean they weren't any ""social media celebrities"" that was shaping the SG Youtube industry. Whilst I personally find most of the content here to be cringe, I need to give credit when credit is due.

2013 and now are 2 very different times, even though its less than a decade apart. Influencers were not as prevalent in 2013, whereas we have so many right now. When ""influencing"" was first starting out (basically social media marketing using questionable methods), it was a niche market. Comparing it to now, it now floods the market, just recently I've seen tons of influencer profiles on Insta having 50K-100K followers and they seem unheard of (**not big names in our scene**) This is **detrimental** for the progression of our media industry in SG, basically its an **open pass** for any ""*market worthy""* random person to make it big, and basically anyone who has actual talent would find it much more difficult to establish themselves. 

Why I compare 2013 to how it is now is because people who were starting out the whole media and Youtube business were putting in effort to make a name for themselves, whereas now its easy for anyone to garner a big following based on **""model like looks""** and **buying followers** (which is one way to gain more followers) I personally feel **nepotism** is prevalent in our media industry, its so much easier for someone to gain a following if they know the ""celebrities"" personally. Not just Nepotism, **cyber bullying** of smaller artists has been cultivated to be ok because big names can throw attacks and get away with it, knowing they have a **toxic fan base of underdeveloped kids** could *potentially* take away that persons rice bowl. Take a look at Nicole, all it took was some personal issues to come out at hand (a few years ago), then some ppl like DK and H started throwing shade at her resulting in her having to deal with a  barrage of undeserved internet hate. Cyberbullying isnt something that can be ""washed away"" easily. It leaves the victim to feel powerless, because there is **nothing they can do** against an online mob attacking blindly.

This shows the amount of power ""big names"" have which could potentially destroy someone's career even though they did nothing wrong. DK finally faces karma and he deserves it, but it also made me think that it could be that someone's trying to potentially sabotage his career because of all the dumb and unnecessary comments he's made about everyone on the internet. Now I also want to talk about the responses from some acquaintances of DK. Nathan, Ben, Jade and H.

Before I talk about some of the responses of this DK saga, one example of ""potentially destroying someones career"" would be a scenario that came out a few months ago. Basically someone on **Twitter** said that they don't feel some of the content here in SG is **good enough** because of the repetitiveness, And guess what ? This person had gotten lots of salty responses and toxic kids trying to defend their temporary role models. **I am not sure if** this individual who made the comment was trying to build a social media career, but it definitely showed how easy it is for people to start attacking someone online just because their views are not aligned, and especially when these big names have responded in childish manners / showcasing their saltiness.

*Back to the responses made by some of the ""celebrities here"" about the DK controversy****.*** 

**Personally** I don't know why but I feel like Nathan couldn't give an unbiased opinion of the whole saga, probably because he's DK's friend. I also listened to the podcast episode  where he was talking about the whole saga, it just seemed like he was rambling on and on without any proper points. Ben on the other hand seemed to give one of the best PR responses I've read and seen, he was unbiased and didn't show ""full support"" of DK just because they are friends and basically summed up to say that DK would face the consequence on his own, and also stated that DK has been professional despite some *rumors* that DK could be acting the same way on a p**rofessional level.** Jade is also someone who's been unbiased on this situation and I applaud her for that. 

On another hand, H decides to give an apology two years late because he "" now understands"" how detrimental this DK controversy is to his career. This is just another way for him to cover and push it all aside, to stay in ""the game"" because he has an established following. Basically he got away with cyber bullying, because a **""sorry""** response is good enough. Thats a ton of BS, H was in his late 20's when he decided to do whatever he did. He's a gown man who did what he did and still isnt 100% taking accountability for his own despicable actions. Same goes for the ""apology"" DK made. It's not genuine.

Another controversial saga is the video that NOC uploaded a while ago and they decided to remove it, only realizing now how bad it for their image. They never thought about how it probably affected some of the people they name dropped then. All these controversies is gonna affect actual talent in SG because then outsiders would probablu=y think / assume that our media thrives on controversy and we dont have actual talent that can disprove otherwise.

Whilst some may argue that the media industry would just go on and content creators would just stay in their lane doing their usual stuff, I'd argue otherwise. All these controversies that has emerged this year is gonna **break** the local social media &amp; YT SG scene **bit by bit.** **Nepotism, cyber bullying and toxicity has been enabled** by some of the ""big names"" here. 

**Basically anyone who is probably trying to break out as a self made artist or creator would have a much more difficult time** because the entire SM scene revolves around the 5-6 big names here. If some self made creators don't adhere to some of the ""standards"" that has been put up, it's harder for them to build a career here. One example is *looks*. Its so much easier for an individual to build a following if they have good looks and if they post content that ""*resonates*"" with the social media generation // kids. It's all a ""*click to avenue*"" and marketing strategy. 

This may be disputed, but someone who has a ""*clickable face*"" that posts rubbish content can garner more views over someone who's average looking but posts great content here. Whilst this is how social media work anyway, its very **detrimental** to **our local scene** because we don't have **enough talent** that is **willing to take risks** to produce **content** that is **out of the box**. Everything would pretty much be the same (**content wise**) and that would **reverse** the amount of progress the local SM / YouTube SG industry has made (*all it takes is time honestly.*) If the **same content** is gonna be generated here for **years**, its just gonna be a ""*dead*"" scene, with **no room for progress**.

It's the same thing with modern rappers. There's so many rappers that that have the same name starting with ""Lil / Young"" that produces the same type of music that is just **recycled and unoriginal**. Even though this is the ""hottest"" thing to do now as an artists, it basically **kills off any actual talent**. When it comes to our local industry, basically originality is dead; because our **creative community** is already quite **small** and ""big names"" that most people in SG knows of are the one running the show, leaving no room for progress and for anyone else to showcase what they are capable of. 

**Before I end the post**, I want to clarify why I used ""celebrities"" on so many occasions. In our scene, we don't have anybody who has an actual celebrity status; because that all we have here. There's no one who has millions of social media following apart from JH  and NOC, which I still find them to be questionable because of the type of content they put out. Same for any musicians here, we don't have any **local** musicians that has a million(s) following fan base. 

This post is **NOT to shade** any local creators here, but just to **prove** how there's **no** room for **progression** in an already **small media scene**. The way the YT media scene works here **imo** is that anyone with actual talent would find it harder to establish themselves.

Food - Think about digestion like exercise, the more work the digestive system needs to do to break down consumed food the harder your body is going to work and the heavier and sweater you will feel. During hot weather stay away from starchy, dense carbs which take a long time to go through your intestines and makes one incredibly sweaty. Trade coffee for tea, which is liang whereas coffee is acidic. Fresh juices instead of carbonated drinks that cause also acidity in the body like wearing internal bubblewrap. Drink all the coffee and Coca-Cola you want when it's rainy just lay off during the sweltering months. Eat more chilli, ginger, mint, anything that evacuates your intestines is good, this organ is so long its is like an internal swollen wool scarf packed full of starchy foods snaking around your abdominal area. Also dairy, greasy oily food takes a lot of energy to digest and makes the sweat sticky so more breakouts. Skip the rice and bread when it's sunny and cloudless. The best diet for hot weather is clear soups, clear noodles like tanghoon or kway teow, mala and of course lots of fruit and raw vegetable salads. 

Clothing - Stay away from anything that says polyester or nylon or acrylic or even blends. This is like covering your skin with mesh saran wrap. Wear natural fibres like cotton or linen especially if you still have to wear a suit, invest in the material as priority because even the best cut suit will look awful covered in sweat spots. 

Bedding - if you are lying in bed sweating it's likely your mattress or mattress protector is some form of polyester or nylon. So even your 1200 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets are no use if you are lying on a plastic surface underneath.

Body products - Ironically some soaps are useless because it leaves a coating on your skin and strips away the natural oils that actually protects and calms the skin. To avoid stinking the only option is eau de toilet. Deodorants with aluminum are linked to cancer and other diseases because you are literally rubbing into your lymph glands which is your armpits. The best option is just lightly rubbing a pinch of baking soda on your armpits which you can get at any supermarket for $2. Invest in a good cologne or perfume, spray it directly on your pulses, not on your clothes, so the scent will mix with your natural musk and that's what gives you your aura. If are sweating when you get out of the shower try a warm shower not a cold one. 

Footwear - Again you can pour a little baking soda in your shoes to neutralize the odors. Some people swear by ultrasonic deoderizers I've never used it before so I can't say. 

Air-conditioning - is a godsend but the older generation makes a point when they say it's actually not good for your health. Breathing artificial recirculated air is probably the most toxic thing we can do to our bodies. The best most beautiful feeling is a cool natural breeze on a hot day. So if you work full time in air conditioning, go outside and get fresh air. 

Anyone else have tips to share feel free to add.

Before I go on, let me state that I do not usully hold on to things so long, but this one seems like a fresh wound every time I remember it and it happens almost unwillingly at random moments, days.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not normally one to let people know of things like this, but I think the anonymity on reddit is somewhat safe. Everyone has had things they had to get over and maybe you guys have certain tips or ideas that might help me, as per what you may have applied in your own lives. All I ask is that you guys be gentle with me, whatever you say.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to sound too emo, but I didn't plan this so I'm just going to type this as my thoughts flow. Apologies for any disconnected thoughts and disjointed writing.

&amp;#x200B;

For further context - I know this is related to friendship, but I'm 32 (29 when this happened) so please try and see this through adult lens rather than an adolescent frame. :)

&amp;#x200B;

I had a friend I got very close too about 4 years ago. Met her at work. She became dear to me. I don't make a lot of new friends, so this was something out of the norm and special. I shared a lot with her, things that were very deep and as someone who absolutely does not open up much (even to my two closest friends), that was something significant. She was the same with me, or so I thought. She is (was) a sweet person; definitely broken, as I was, but I saw her for the generosity and the care she brought to the people around her.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm someone who grew up very insecure about the way I am; both personality-wise and appearance-wise. I never quite fit in with my peers on account of both, but as I grew up, I learnt to accept that this is who I am and I found that whereas I was ostracised at school, I was beloved at work and that helped heal my wounds. But I do remain wary, to this day, of how people perceive me. I just don't let it rule my days as it used to.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, I know I'm rambling. But I often find myself trying trying to justify my response when I think about it, lest I am deemed or deem myself to be (as I often do) to be oversensitive on account of the issue on its own.

&amp;#x200B;

Going back to that friend, I came to know in late 2018 that she had ridiculed me when I wasn't around. By that, I mean - whipped out her phone and showed her own circle of friends (whom I do not know) a photo of me, while mockingly asking if any one of them would date someone like me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm rather big and don't rank well on the good looks meter (like I mentioned, it is what it is and I'm working on it but there are some things I can't quite change), so it's not like the fact I'm mostly unattractive is not known to me.

&amp;#x200B;

But it hit me like a knife in my back. I remember this conversation and being so calm throughout it, feeling the hurt and I didn't cry in the moment but I cried days later and I still cry now when I think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Lol, my eyes are watering again (no pity please, I just say this for context).  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is someone whom, when we talked I repeatedly called beautiful because she was beautiful to look at and still is beautiful; she knew it and yet she had so very many insecurities about herself.

&amp;#x200B;

She would often say things to me like ""you know you're beautiful right?"" and though I would just smile about it, having the thought that she is a friend who cares and wants me to be a bit more confident, I appreciated her effort. She would ooze sincerity. Literally, OOZE.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, bam.

&amp;#x200B;

Did she take me for a ride? I doubt it. I knew her deepest secrets. She shared them with me. Things that people would have judged her for and things that were clearly wrong. I've held her tight while she was upset, rushing down to meet her after work.

&amp;#x200B;

So, it's not like it was a one-sided thing

&amp;#x200B;

Sigh.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried everything, from forgiving her in my mind, to forgiving her aloud, to tell myself I should forgive her. And I think I have? Yes, I think I might have. But the memory and the feelings are so fresh. So maybe I haven't forgiven her?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so much pain at this that I can feel myself trembling sometimes when I recall it and I give in to a spiral.

&amp;#x200B;

Given my age (32), in a way I feel even more ashamed at the way I think/feel about this. I feel like I should be an adult and get over it, but I can't quite seem to get there. ""Get over it"", as much as I've told myself numerous times, doesn't quite cut it.

I no longer take photos much with my friends. I find myself even more wary of people and their intentions. While I remain outwardly bubbly, inside I have retreated into a shell within a shell.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I have given this issue more control over my life than I should and I think, in  a number of ways, this may have given rise  to more issues (not on its own, but in tandem with other things).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

One of the worst things about this is that early on following this issue, I would fantasize about rebuilding my friendship with her. I no longer do, but that makes me feel so ashamed.

&amp;#x200B;

Was I that much of a pushover that I would want to rekindle a friendship with someone whose actions hurt so badly?

&amp;#x200B;

On hindsight, I realized there were many toxic aspects to our friendship. How did I miss it? I question what I let slide in my initial view of her? Did I deserve it for not seeing things I should have seen?

&amp;#x200B;

I am usually so careful!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Reading this back, I see how messy it is, jumping from point to point, but i'll leave it as it is because that's exactly how I feel when this thought occurs.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fine at other times though, I have day to day issues and laughs and upsets like everyone else, but this one is really really tiresome and grating. It is not like it's constantly a forefront though, it's not - but when it  comes on, it comes on strong and it still invites tears.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else experienced something similar as an adult?

&amp;#x200B;

Would appreciate thoughts and tips on how to move on from this. It's been too long and I feel like it's just digging a deeper hole as time passes by.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you! :)

I have an extremely toxic parent. She’s a narcissist and I suspect, a little bipolar as well. In her crazy frenzy, she would blast music when I’m asleep and then insist I wasn’t asleep. After the initial argument, she would immediately slander me for only hanging out with rich people (which is entirely not true), that I don’t have real friends and all my friends are only temporary (which is also not true, I spent most of 2019 kicking out toxic friends, and keeping my close friends even closer). I never really lived my life, I could only go overseas when I don’t inform her bcos she would always say no, and when I’m overseas, she would call my friends instead of me, to ask about us. Once we quarreled and she said she always wanted to jump down. She also has special snowflake syndrome, just not the Karen level yet. When I WFH, she would type extremely loud on her keyboard even when i voice out that it’s my pet peeve several times, and asked me to deal with it. She also would not eat the dinners that my siblings and i cook. She always says things like “sorry you guys only eat atas food” and proceeds to cook plain porridge for herself. Note that we are not poor, and average. After all these paggro remarks, she proceeds to give us $30 each a day.

54,singapore,270406,What Singapore can learn from the US presidential debate,j2ifsi,OldProtectionism,1601455204,269,1,"With the first presidential debate between Democrat candidate Joe Biden and Republican incumbent Donald Trump recently over, a sh\*tstorm has emerged on social media. The technologically savvy are flooding pages with their memes, and news outlets are rushing out their articles.

And after watching just five minutes of the debate (coupled with skimming through some articles and memes), I think there's a lot we as Singaporeans can take away from all this, even if we are thousands of kilometres away from them.

**1) The divisiveness of partisan politics**

First thing that came to mind was the hyper-partisanry that exists in US politics. It's alarming and almost crazy, but even though some of us may think such a thing would never happen in Singapore, I'd believe that there is growing potential for partisanry here.

You already start to see divisions forming, based on those who follow MSM devoutly (Straits Times, Today, CNA, etc) and those who uphold alternative news media outlets like TOC and WakeUpSG as the bringers of absolute truth. Not yet very visible, but definitely growing.

To quote PM Lee on describing partisan politics:

&gt;This is my side, and that is yours. There is no middle ground, only sides to take. There are no truths or facts, only different versions of reality - facts and, of equal standing, 'alternative facts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Politics becomes toxic and bitter. The country is divided, and goes into a downward spiral.   
&gt;  
&gt; If this happens to Singapore, we will not just cease being an exceptional nation. It will be the end of us. We must not go down this path.

The reality is that it is true. If the US can become so divisive, why can't it happen to us? Maybe not next year, or the following year, but perhaps in a decade or two, it very well may become the reality.

We need to keep in mind that regardless of our political views (pro-PAP, pro-opposition, or even neutral), we are Singaporeans and want the best for our country. Remembering this will help to manage the proliferation of partisanry here, and hopefully prevent us from going down a slippery slope.

**(This is not sponsored by National Education or whatever, just to say.)**

**2) Accountability** 

While I do agree with the sentiments held by some Singaporeans that the ruling PAP needs to be held more accountable for its actions, it is worth to note and appreciate the level of accountability we already have.

For all the sh\*t we give Jo Teo and her compatriots, at the very least they usually don't spew falsehoods and provocative statements on the level Donald Trump and his posse do in the US. Tables will definitely flip if they do such a thing, especially in this day and age post-LKY.

And what some people in the US are demanding for better accountability in the White House, can be taken into serious consideration for adoption here in Singapore, so as to improve accountability and transparency of our own government.

**3) Despite our differences, nation comes first**

Already mentioned this indirectly or in passing in the first point, but I cannot stress this enough. We see the selfie PM Lee took with Pritam Singh, and think its a normal occurrence. Some may also think that its a tokenistic action taken by LHL or whatnot.

But in all honesty do you think such a thing would happen in today's American society? Do you really think Trump and Biden would take any picture together, without the burning desire to insult each other? I mean sure, you could argue that this is an anomaly, given how Obama and his McCain in 2008 were actually seemed to be on quite decent terms, despite rivalry and all. And actually despite how bitter Obama and Mitt Romney seemed to be in 2012, they have actually defended each other on more than one occasion.

And I do think that most opposition politicians want the best for Singapore, and that they aren't in the arena because of some personal agenda or whatnot. The only exception that comes to mind off-hand is of course Lim Tean, but that's a story for another time.

So, if the politicians are able to put Singapore before their political differences when needed, I think we should too. Fight all you want on political matters, but beyond that arena we are all Singaporeans, regardless of race, language, and religion.

**4) How debates should not be like**

The debate between Trump and Biden were full of low-blows, character assassinations - in general things most debaters would frown upon. Honestly, even Biden was not exempt from resorting to such tactics during the debate.

Thankfully we don't see much of this during political debates here in Singapore. **And it needs to stay that way.** Debates are meant to be meaningful intellectual discussions on perspectives, problems, and policies, not to insult each other to kingdom come just to pander to your own base. 

As much as some of us may wish to see LO Singh or Jamus Lim to beat LHL down in parliament, or for Tharman to crush one of the opposition MPs, debates and discourse need to be kept civil and fruitful. If not honestly, what's the point? We'll only get short term satisfaction of seeing people we don't like get destroyed on the screen, and few meaningful decisions reached on improving the country going forward.

There's this test that asian parents do where they'll place a few items in front of the child to somehow ""guess"" which profession they'd be interested in when they grew older.

A dad once did this with her daughter who was still an infant. 

After placing all the items in front of her and waiting for her response, the daughter pushed all the items aside, and chose to approach the father.

58,singapore,267865,The Severity of Sexual Assault / Harassment in Singapore,ivk1ex,Yellow-Apple-Tree,1600482557,271,1,"It concerns me a little how sexual assault is becoming such a sensitive topic. I can understand how there are false allegations out there but I would just want to ask one thing:

If I were to be sexually harassed / assaulted in public and no one saw and there were no surveillance cameras around to catch it (like at an old HDB void deck, etc) how should I go about handling this case? And how do we prevent such things? Right now there’s just proper sex ed on the table...

I’ve actually been catcalled several times and harassed to some extent in public. I never made a big deal about these things because I never know what to do in these situations… My reflexes are too slow to grab them, or take a good look at their faces. The worst part is, these situations happen in places where there aren’t many people and where there aren’t surveillance cameras (as far as I could tell anyway). What do I do when I have such a lack of evidence? Just walk away and speak to a therapist? Yeah, that’s basically what I’ve been doing...

Let me speak from experience that similar things happened to me a few times throughout my life since an early age. The first time I was ‘touched inappropriately’ was at a Popular outlet at Tiong Bahru when I was about 12. Issue was, this guy was about my age or even younger. He was going past me across an aisle while I was browsing books, and instead saying ‘excuse me’, he grabbed my ass and pushed me aside. Yes, by my ass. I wasn’t wearing anything revealing as a 12 year old. I was wearing a long pair of pants. I assumed it was an accident since he was as young as I and I didn’t know the first thing about the process of filing a report as a primary school kid. When I told my mum she asked me if I saw his face but the moment I mentioned it was another kid about my age, the matter was brushed aside as ‘probably an accident’. I don’t think this should have been settled by law but at least talk to his parents about it right?

As an adult, I’ve had people brush against my personal areas but they are likely to have been accidents... I think… One incident that happened that I was sure wasn't an accident was while I was walking home and it happened so fast I only realised I was violated after the man walked away. 

I’m not sure what I want to see if I were reporting these people… Retribution? I would definitely like to slap them across the face for whistling at me like they were calling at a dog, or when they suddenly shove their hand in my face and laugh and walk off (idk if this is sexual harassment but this is harassment still right?) or make gross faces at me or outright touch my ass. They don’t necessarily hurt me physically but I just feel ashamed and insulted every time. The problem is that this doesn’t just happen to me, it happens to many women and for many men as well in Singapore quite often and it hurts to think that I’m one of those people who contribute to trivialising sexual assault / harassment for not reporting them just because I don’t think it would lead anywhere. And men who experience sexual assault are dismissed often because of some stigma and toxic masculine attitudes towards men showing vulnerabilities.

Some of the sexual assault posts I’ve seen here are often met with comments like: 

“Why didn’t you report this immediately?”

“It’s cos they think you chio”

“But the women's charter is especially strong in Singapore…” 

Ok we clearly see the flood of university sexual misconduct cases that lead to little consequences for the perpetrators even if there's a women's charter. Very little is done sometimes in the spirit of ‘possible rehabilitation’ On the one hand, I didn’t get injured. But it makes me very uncomfortable to even take the bus home at night especially when I work in an industry that’s notorious for overtime work. 

Ok the rant is over but the question still stands: how do I handle a case where I don’t have much evidence to begin with (like the aforementioned situations)? Do I just go to AWARE or a therapist?

My dad and my mum divorced when I was 11. My dad basically cheated. Have been cheating for many years. I was the first person to find out about it. I was 3 when I walked in on him and the lady in the midst of love making. He made me promise to lie to my mum about it also lie about bringing me out with the other lady. I was just 3. He also likes to drink a lot. Gets drunk and sleep with the TV on. Is a bump and does not work to earn money. Proceeds to gamble using credit card and ask my mum to foot the loans. He used to beat me a lot as well and hits me even harder when my mum asked him to stop. Simply because I couldn’t grasp the concept of algebra at the age of 5. I don’t have good memories (with him) while I was growing up. Didn’t have a normal childhood as well because of him as he spoiled my house lock just to prevent my mum and I from entering the house because he lost his key while he was out, drunk was with the other lady and my mum refused to get another one made for him. Ps the house was paid FULLY by my uncle on my mum side and my mum myself. My dad did not contribute a cent. Neither did he buy any furnitures. He also takes money out of my mum piggy bank. Saw it with my own eyes. He didn’t bother paying child support. Also tried to force me to go out with him for bonding sessions after the divorce. Tried to physically restrain me when I wanted to go home (had bruises from his grip.) he also tried to guilt trip me saying things like I’m your dad etc. You should go out with me because I miss you etc. I don’t miss him tho. Just saying. I was 11 and I do not miss my dad. Because he have always been absent in my life. He never attended PT meetings. After not being in contact for multiple years, I decided to reach out to him last year to see if there were any chance that he have changed. Met him on my birthday and he was still the same man. Was rather disappointed. As he kept blaming the whole divorce on my mum and kept telling me that I was too young to know anything. What happened subsequently was even worse. Because his whole family stood on his side, I then decided to distant myself from them as it was making me uncomfortable. He proceeds to use religion to pressure me saying that I have not forgiven him etc when my point was that he did not change after so many years. He kept reaching out to me just to use the bible against me and said how I should forgive him as how god has forgiven the rest of us (Christianity) I found it rather toxic and it also made me unnecessarily stressed and anxious when I receive his message. After I’m currently 39w2d pregnant. I don’t wish to introduce him into my child’s life. I don’t know how to go about it as he is still pestering and spamming my phone with messages. I tried to be straight forward and told him before but he just kept saying things like oh you haven’t forgive me etc. You’re sinning etc. I honestly feel so pressured but I do not want to allow him to be in my son (and future kids) life as I feel that he will cause more harm than good (brainwashing them like how he tried with me that my mum is evil etc) 
He has been a Christian even before he married my mum. He is currently enrolled in some bible college and is using that to justify ‘you are sinning as you have not forgiven me’

60,singapore,266845,Let’s define “toxic masculinity” shall we?,iszk9y,starscream258,1600135917,41,1,"Firstly, I am speaking from a male POV, not some leftist or feminist POV. 

A simple social experiment:
If you see an elderly lady/man struggling with 4 heavy bags of NTUC grocery, will you offer your assistance?
(I would)


If you see an lady or auntie struggling with her 4 heavy bags of NTUC grocery, will you offer your assistance?
(I would)

If you see a man struggling with 4 same heavy bags of NTUC grocery, will you offer your assistance?

Personally, I would not. 
1) I view the man as my equal physically and if I could manage the 4 bags on my own, I expect the man to be able to. 

2) How awkward and weird would it be for me and for that man, if I went to speak with him and offer my help? (Context: he is a male stranger to me and I am a male stranger to him) Will I hurt his ego? Will I feel hurt if he rejects me etc

And oh regarding point 1, yes generally I do not regard women as my ‘physical equal’, not saying I look down on them, it’s just that generally women aren’t as strong as guys. That’s why I would offer help. 

Ok if so far you are with me.....
And you understand the point about viewing other males as your equal physically, apply that view to NS. 

3) If I can survive BMT and 2.5 years in NS (not even talking about mono intake guards, diver, cdo), I would expect other males to make it through as well... because I view them as my physical equals, as fellow pes A/B men. (This is a general statement, there are always exceptions like medical conditions, pes c9 and below)

The above 3 points are my own opinions and my POV. 
This isn’t about age difference, generation difference aka boomer vs millennial etc. 
This is just a simple view of how a guy view another guys. 

Now for the questions:
Which at point did you think it devolved into “toxic masculinity” or did it at all?

Are my 3 points acceptable to you, as a guy?

Some background about me, to give context. I'm a trans woman (aka AMAB, MtF) who was raised as a guy and later relearned to socialise as a woman. Went thru NS, saw several divorce proceedings in my family, and can share what both guys and gals think they understand, but they actually don't. **Many of my proposed solutions disregard the logistics and economics of the real world though, so take it with a bucket of salt and see it as the ""ideal solution if SG were in a sandbox game"".**

Tl;dr: Most of the problems in gender equality stems from outdated notions of gender and gender roles. To have gender equality means to break some of these traditions down, which is something the older generation have a hard time accepting, as well as the religious/conservatives.

**National Service**

Ah, conscription. The supposed great equalizer of our nation. Alright, look. There is a real need to defend ourselves, no doubt about that. But I think that women can also be conscripted - not just in ""typical feminine roles"" like clerical duties, or nursing or some other bullshit. But in actual combat. If Israel can implement it, so can we.

Part of the problem is the very, very toxic environment in the military. Mostly coming from the older generation. There's a very toxic, perverted version of what being a man looks like. Aka, toxic masculinity. All the ""eh, you gu niang ah?"" isn't helping either - it's reinforcing the mindset that women aren't as capable as men. SG women also have themselves to blame. They have been told by society that they are weaker sex, that they can expect men to do certain stuff for them. They think that NS is super tough, and that they can't do it. I believe they - we - can. All the time we have been telling women that the world is their oyster, but apparently not when it comes to NS.

At present, men resent women for not understanding what they go through, and women resent men for their whinging or not being to participate when guys are discussing NS matters. Both sides have blame.

**Marriage, Divorce and related**

Many have realised that the divorce and alimony is biased towards women. That is true. That is a fact. This is sort of a tricky one since SG in essence has 3 different cultures regarding this - Pioneer generation, Boomers, and Millennials. For the pioneer and boomer generation, women generally were stay-at-home moms. Sometimes, they were forbidden to work (like in the case of my mom). Alimony laws were written with that in mind. For millennials today, it's not the same. Women earn about the same as men (gender pay gap discussion for another time, not today), and are generally better positioned to support themselves. I think the courts are trying their best to award alimony where it is needed, and strike down frivolous claims/gold diggers. It'll never be a perfect system, and people will fall through the gaps. I don't see an easy way out, or any for that matter, until the boomer generation passes. If anyone has ideas, do post in the comments.

**Legislation on Sexual stuffs**

I am a very very firm believer of law reform regarding sexual deviancy, assault, and the like. If we want true equality, we can't base rape on penetration. **We have to base it on consent.** Be it male or female, trans or cis, hetero or homosexual, No consent = sexual assault. Period. Of course, there is also the matter of people not taking men's accounts of sexual/domestic abuse seriously enough. All the ""if you're a girl you must be chaste, if you are a guy you should have lots of sex"" rhetoric also has to end. The ""master key/shitty lock"" analogy has to go.

Of course, this will also mean that legislation/parliament will have to clarify that gender is now inconsequential to sexual laws. And that means that means stuff like 377A will also have to go. Otherwise it'll be a philosophical/logical inconsistency. That is, if gender is not considered in sexual assault, then anti-homosexuality laws will have to include both men and women. In the wider penal code and legislation, laws permitting gender discrimination (e.g. marital laws) will have to justify themselves, which I think is a good thing for both men and women. Not all discrimination is bad. For example, women-only gyms or men-only support groups do have legitimate reasons to discriminate the other gender from their spaces. We do have to purge legislation that unjustly favours one gender, though.

**Employment**

Let's start off with paternity leave. I agree that there should be paternity leave - it's been shown that it's good for the child, the family as a whole, and the recovery of the mother. I also believe that it should go further than just ""recovering from pregnancy leave"". I believe that there should be both paternity and maternity leave for the first 3 years of the child's life. It will be beneficial for the child to have both their parents around. Maybe something like a few weeks off each year. Norway pays the company for the lost productivity, to hire a temp, etc. Research has suggested that, in the long run, this pays off.  [https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12661](https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12661)

**Concluding Statements**

In summary, a lot of changes I want to see will need a long time to achieve, because people are slow to change. The crux of the matter is toxic beliefs of femininity and masculinity. The macho man and girly girl has to go. Traditional gender roles has to go. Not saying that we do away with masculinity and femininity, but we trim the bad parts of it like, ""boys can't cry"" or ""girls should be demure and submissive"". Unfortunately, I see the biggest problem will be the older generation, and religion. The older generation because, well, upbringing is hard to change. Religion because many religions prescribe a hierarchy to things. Like god is on a higher hierarchy than humans, therefore we should listen to god. They bring it to other aspects such as the household (the male is the head of the household, must obey, etc), marriage, and also governmental institutions when politicians push their own beliefs instead of representing the constituents in parliament. This will be especially prominent in the battle of 377A.

To achieve racial-, gender-, class-equality is to be progressive/left-wing. There are many other aspects I'd like to cover, and many of the points I've made have been significantly generalised (i.e. lost many nuances), but it all ultimately boils down to toxic beliefs of gender and gender roles, and we should get rid of them. It's a society problem, not a man vs women problem, so let's all come together to work at the problem, not each other.

Edit: Many have commented on conscripting women, and here is my take that I've replied to 2 other redditors. My intent was to give women that push to help them realise what they are capable of, in response to change the ""women are the weaker sex"" mindset. For example, before WWI, women did not think they could perform as well as men in factory and manufacturing jobs. The war/manpower shortage gave them that involuntary push to realise that they could. I was thinking more in terms of a behavioural/cultural change, and did not put much thought into practicality or utility in having women in NS. The behavioural scientist in me, I guess. (Apparently the stereotype about scientists being disconnected with the real world applies to me. I'm sorry, Wilhelm Wundt and people of the Boulder Conference).",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/isgwvr/discussion_commentary_on_gender_equality_in/,0.75,"['Adding on to the post, there are also many issues women go through, such as the gender pay gap, not being taken seriously in the workplace, or being seen as bossy/a bitch if they assert their authority.\n\nThis post was meant more...""refined"", shall we say?, version of u/LolPlsDONTfollowme post, informing people about what men in Singapore can advocate for (e.g. parental leave), how toxic masculinity hurts both men and women, and how we can come together to work the problem instead of playing the blame game.']"

hello,, i really feel loved by the outpouring comments and messages i received from my prev post. tqsm, that rly gave me energy to feel alive. now i need advice to move forward. 

i had a medical appt with my psychologist today, but i feel like i jus cannot connect with him as he kept saying i was confusing him (so i had to explain to him several times). and in b/w the convo, there will be lots of awkward pauses and he will ask me ""how do u feel abt it"" or ""what do u think abt it"" when honestly ive said what i needed to say...sometimes i ponder if im the one who has a problem b/c i have ady switched psychologist once...so shd i change to another one? altho it has only been one month w my current psych, i jus felt like we were constantly at diff wavelengths. 

more imptly, he was suggesting me to move out instead (due to the family environment and the other reasons which i mentioned in my reddit post), but the thing is im not financially stable now as my parents prevly quit my retail job w/o my consent. til now, my bosses cant give me a definite answer. but i rly need the income. during this pandemic season, its not easy for me to find another job that is near my location, has flexible timings and offers average pay. due to my health condition, im unable to travel far to work for long hours. so ive been really troubled with finances. as much as im providing home tuition now (fortunately), it definitely isnt enough for me to cover my medical bills and have food in the long run (which is why i only eat 1 meal a day for now). i prevly did a one-time off fundraising, but i felt as if it was so unethical of me to take people's money for me to seek priv mental health treatment, when others prob need it way more than me. initially i received more than required, so i donated it to mental health organisations. but subsequently i got into crisis, so my medical appts became even more frequent. if i drag it, i will lack medical attention. i have switched from hospital to hospital, and now to a priv clinic. im also tired to switch again. reason why i switched from hospital to hospital was bc they said they couldnt rly help me and all would jus refer me to imh (which is rly not what i want). sometimes i rly feel like a burden b/c i rly didnt choose to be like this. i wish i can drag it. but sometimes i jus feel so overwhelmed i cant take it, and my parents wish i can just rely on my willpower and pretend im not feeling depressed/anxious - so that the medical bills wont be so huge (i still try to fund most of it alone). i have siblings too, so all the more im sure its barely enuf for them. and since they are studying, id rather they receive more than i do (due to exp edu fees as well...) and work it out alone... 

as for moving out, for sure i do not feel safe and happy staying at home, but it doesnt seem to be a viable solution for me to move out due to finances and law issues (since im still considered a minor) now. idk what to do from here. please help me. the solutions proposed are easier said than done. idk how long more i can pull through...

**Chinese privilege’ as shortcut in Singapore: a rejoinder
Daniel P. S. Goh &amp; Terence Chong**

*Abstract*

We disagree with Humairah Zainal and Walid Jumblatt Abdullah that Chinese privilege exists in Singapore politics and that it is perpetuated by the political hegemony of the long-ruling People’s Action Party (PAP). Consequentially, we disagree that ‘Chinese privilege’ is thus a useful concept for understanding politics in Singapore. Our rejoinder argues that ‘Chinese privilege’ is under-specified and decontextualized by the authors, used uncritically as a shortcut for the consequences of the long-ruling party’s political hegemony for ethnic relations, and is therefore a polarizing distraction to the critical analysis required to advance anti-racism discourse and understanding in Singapore. We show that the authors have mistook incumbent political privilege for Chinese privilege. We argue that ethnic majority and minority Members of Parliament from both governing and opposition parties have had to simultaneously serve as community leaders and transcend ethnic affiliations to represent national interests.

*Introduction*

The article by Humairah Zainal and Walid Jumblatt Abdullah, ‘Chinese Privilege in Politics: A case of Singapore’s ruling elite’, published online by Asian Ethnicity in December 2019 can be summed up along the following lines. Chinese privilege exists in Singapore politics and is perpetuated by the political hegemony of the long-ruling People’s Action Party (PAP). This can be seen in the advantages and benefits enjoyed by ethnic Chinese parliamentarians which are closed off to ethnic minority ones. ‘Chinese privilege’ is therefore not only evident but, as a concept, useful in understanding politics in Singapore.
We appreciate the effort of the authors to write about race, racism, and racialism in postcolonial Singapore. Too few scholars have provided grounded and critical assessment of the Singapore case which many international academics and policymakers view as a success in managing racial relations and promoting social harmony. The complexity of race, racism, and racialism as socio-political and economic phenomena across the wide range of contemporary issues in multicultural and multi-religious Singapore deserves scholarly attention. It is in this spirit that we engage with the assertions and arguments made by the authors in their article. We disagree firmly but respectfully with Humairah and Walid that ‘Chinese privilege’ is a useful concept for understanding politics in Singapore. Our rejoinder can be summed up as such: ‘Chinese privilege’ as a concept is under-specified and decontextualized by the authors, used uncritically as a shortcut for the consequences of the long-ruling party’s political hegemony for ethnic relations, and is therefore a polarizing distraction to the critical analysis required to advance anti-racism discourse and understanding in Singapore. We point to four major flaws in their article.
The first issue we have is the ahistorical and delocalised application of ‘Chinese privilege’ in contemporary Singapore. The authors acknowledge that the concept is a literal transposition of ‘white privilege’ and rightfully note that that other scholars ‘have highlighted certain shortcomings of “white privilege” as an analytical concept,’ shortcomings made starker by the complexity of Southeast Asian societies.1 Despite these admissions, they neither deem it necessary to discuss the limitations or the historical trajectory of ‘Chinese privilege’ nor seek to tighten the definition of the term for local application in their article. This neglect has important implications for the scholarship of privilege and racism.
Humairah and Walid take it for granted that ‘Chinese privilege’ exists solely because there is a Chinese majority. This assumption empties the concept of any local and historical nuances such as the deep intertwining of language, education, and ethnicity. Conscientious students of politics in Singapore would know that the term cannot apply to the Chinese-educated who saw their Chinese-medium schools disappear from the landscape and replaced by English-medium schools in the early years of the country’s industrialisation. The same groups also suffered the loss of employment opportunities when English-medium education was preferred over Chinese-medium education. What about the concerns over the loss of Chinese dialects and the alienation of the older generations in the state’s drive to promote Mandarin as lingua franca of the Chinese population? Would the authors then argue that ‘Chinese privilege’ was enjoyed only by English-educated Chinese and not Chinese-educated Chinese, or only by Mandarin- speaking Chinese and not dialect-speaking Chinese? Their vaguely defined concept is akin to a poorly polished lens that fails to pick up important cultural nuances.

The fact of the matter is that, in addition to race, identity politics comprises language, ethnicity, and class, all of which have deep historical specificity in postcolonial Singapore. This fact is obscured by the authors’ simplistic application of the concept to the local. The treatment given by Humairah and Walid to the phrase ‘Chinese’ in ‘Chinese privilege’ reduces a complex ethnicity into a one-dimensional racial identity. Their homogenisa- tion of ‘Chinese’ is arguably what the postcolonial state was trying to do with its education and cultural policies which targeted the diverse Chinese-educated and dialect- speaking groups that make up the Chinese population in Singapore. On the other hand, historians, sociologists, and anthropologists have studied and highlighted the complex- ities of being Chinese and becoming Singaporean, as befitting a diverse diasporic group struggling for political accommodation in the making of a multiracial, multi-ethnic, and multicultural nation-state. It would be very relevant and interesting for an article to study the interaction between the ruling party’s political hegemony and the complexities of Chinese-ness for a journal such as Asian Ethnicity. However, the concept of ‘Chinese privilege’, because of its straight-jacketed application to a complex community with a multiplicity of class, linguistic, and educational fissures, short-circuits this engagement and causes Humairah and Walid to neglect this crucial body of local scholarship.

Secondly, the authors make no distinction between ‘Chinese privilege’ and the advan- tages of political incumbency. Their lack of distinction blurs the conceptual contours of ‘Chinese privilege’ allowing the concept to be anything for anyone. For example, on one hand, they argue that Fasial Manap, a minority Member of Parliament (MP) from the opposition Workers’ Party (WP), was attacked in Parliament for bringing up Malay issues; and this was evidence of Chinese privilege because, presumably, an ethnic Chinese MP would not have faced the same hostility for bringing up Chinese issues. On the other, the authors also note that ‘PAP minority parliamentarians do not usually do the same [bring up Malay or Indian issues], because they believe in the importance of both maintaining party unity and not upsetting societal stability by discussing sensitive matters” and that “they tend to agree with the government more often than not.’2

If indeed these PAP minority MPs ‘tend to agree with the government,’ are the authors then suggesting that these minority parliamentarians are complicit in upholding ‘Chinese privilege’? Would the authors at least grant them some sense of agency and acknowledge that these parliamentarians genuinely believed that the open discussion of racial and religious matters did more political harm than good? In any case, this assertion is false. Historically, there were figures such as Haji Ya’acob bin Mohamed who spoke his mind about Malay interests and criticised government polices during his three terms as PAP MP and after he retired from politics in 1980. More recently, Yaacob Ibrahim, who was formerly a minister in the cabinet, firmly reminded the government in Parliament not to forget, in the bicentennial commemoration of the founding of modern Singapore by British East India Company officer Sir Stamford Raffles, what the Malays had to go through under colonialism and still have to endure. What he said is worth quoting in full:

*Sir, this commemoration should also lead us to a better appreciation of our communities’ history and our place in the region. Out of the colonial experience emerged many disturbing myths about this region, including the most toxic myth of the lazy native. This myth has been studied and debunked extensively, for instance, by the late Prof Syed Hussein Al-atas in his famous book entitled ‘The Myth of the Lazy Native’, which tore apart the colonial ideology behind labelling the indigenous population as lazy for not wanting to work in the mines and plantations. Nevertheless, that still lingers in the minds of some people.

When I was growing up in modern Singapore, my own teachers dismissed my community as being lazy and unable to study hard. Sir, this is the burden of history that my community carries. It is unjust and unfair. If we are to commemorate the bicentennial we must also recognise the less savoury aspects of it – practices and ideas designed to meet the needs and maximise the profits of the empire at the expense of the indigenous population.3*

More importantly, the authors failed to ask whether PAP minority parliamentarians enjoyed exclusive platforms such as closed-door meetings with community stakeholders and institutions or back-channels to government agencies and cabinet ministers. If so, then WP’s Faisal is not suffering the ill-effects of ‘Chinese privilege’ but the more mundane disadvantage of being in an opposition party. In fact, this was the case in cabinet minister Masagos Zulkifli’s rebuke of Faisal when the latter raised the issue of allowing Muslim girls and women to wear their religious headscarf in schools and the uniformed services during a debate on the motion to acknowledge the aspirations of Singapore women. It is unfortunate that Humairah and Walid raised this example to bolster their case but failed to observe that Masagos objected to Faisal’s constant raising of the headscarf issue in Parliament whenever the opportunity presented itself by saying that there was ‘a right time, a right place and a right way to discuss this,’ that ‘Government leaders and community leaders of all races and religions have been actively discussing such sensitive and deeply emotive matters in a number of closed-door platforms.’4 Denied of closed-door platforms and back channels because he was an opposition MP, not because he was a minority parliamentarian, Faisal could do little else but raise the issue in Parliament, the only platform available to him to represent his constituents. The minister’s rebuke was thus disingenuous, but this example does not show ‘Chinese privilege’ or the burdens of minoritarian parliamentarians, only the political privilege denied to opposition parliamentarians.
Thirdly, the bar for ‘Chinese privilege’ seems to be set rather low. Humairah and Walid argue that minority Malay or Indian parliamentarians feel the consequences of ‘Chinese privilege’ because they are expected to ‘become de facto leaders of their communities’ while ‘simultaneously expected to transcend those ethnic identifications.’5 Chinese MPs, on the other hand, according to the authors, enjoy ‘Chinese privilege’ because they do not face this dilemma. Such arguments ignore the complexity of contemporary identity politics and flies against the face of evidence. Ethnic Chinese MPs too have to walk the fine line between ‘community’ and ‘national’ interests. The rise of China as an economic and geopolitical power over the last two decades has placed pressure on Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, not least Singapore. Many older and more conservative Chinese Singaporeans might feel cultu- rally connected to China and thus instinctively supportive of Beijing’s interests, while others are cognisant that such support may be at odds with their country’s interest. So too ethnic Chinese MPs, whether of the PAP or opposition variety, have to constantly balance the strong support that their constituencies might have for China with the need to advance national interests which might, from time to time, contradict Beijing’s interests. In short, the authors’ claim that ‘minority MPs are expected to go beyond ethnicity, and at times, minimize their ethnic affiliations’ should be extended to ethnic Chinese MPs too.6 The point here is that toggling between the interests of one’s ethnic community and those of the nation is not unique to ethnic minority MPs, and is certainly a low bar for a demonstration of ‘Chinese privilege’.

The example of the longest-serving opposition MP, Low Thia Khiang, who served from 1991 to 2020 and was WP’s leader, is instructive in this regard. He was driven to politics by the injustice of the closure of the region’s only Chinese-medium university, Nanyang University, his alma mater, by the PAP government and the discrimination faced by its Chinese-educated graduates. He won his seat amidst the PAP parliamentary monopoly in a constituency composed of tight-knit Teochew-speaking communities, with which he formed close personal relationships by speaking the dialect and assiduously attending community events such as Chinese religious and festive celebrations and funeral wakes. He was initially deemed a parochial MP representing ethnic Chinese interests. He was laughed at by the English- educated elites of the PAP for his halting command of the English language, but eventually won their grudging respect by learning to debate with them in English in a principled manner. In recent years, he also won the respect of the government leadership for calling on Singapore to carve its own multicultural Chinese identity in the context of China’s rising assertiveness in the region. He said in Parliament in 2017, after a period of diplomatic tension with China:
We have encouraged our businessmen, entrepreneurs and professionals to connect with their Chinese counterparts using deep historical and cultural links. We saw the complications when Singaporeans doing business and working in China came under public pressure during the events last year. Some Singaporeans were even of the opinion that we should appease China. Singapore not only risks becoming economically vulnerable to any strategic foreign policy shift by China, the multi-racial and multi-cultural character of our society will also come under pressure.7

Finally, the authors misdiagnose PAP privilege for ‘Chinese privilege’. The authors point to the Group Representative Constituency (GRC) and the Reserved Presidency scheme to argue that they have eroded the state’s capacity to embody the ideologies of multiracialism and meritocracy.8 This is a valid criticism which has been raised by other observers, and we have no issue with this. However, the authors make no clear attempt to demonstrate how the GRC (which guarantees minority presence in parliament) or the Reserved Presidency (which guarantees a minority president at regular intervals) perpetuate ‘Chinese privilege’ or ‘Chinese hegemony’. They fail to explain why the purportedly ‘Chinese’ ruling elite would seek to provide for more minority representation when it would be far easier to leave elections results in the hands of the Chinese voting majority. In fact, the PAP leaders acknowledged that they were expending their political capital by championing the Reserved Presidency despite public opposition because they believed this would firm up the multiracial character of the state. In other words, if political hegemony sustains ‘Chinese privilege’ as the authors claim, why would the PAP elite seek to implement mechanisms that ensure minority presence to their political cost? The more accurate explanation for GRCs and the Reserved Presidency is that they better serve PAP privilege, making it much harder for opposition politicians and anti-establishment figures to gain access to Parliament and the Presidency.
In conclusion, this rejoinder does not deny that racism exists in Singapore. It does not deny that ethnic minorities faced historical and structural impediments to their advance- ment, or that many continue to encounter everyday stereotyping, discrimination, and downright racism. However, it is precisely because such problems exist that we feel it is necessary to have conceptually clear and intellectually rigorous commentaries which seek to investigate race and race relations in Singapore. The easy borrowing of popular phrases and labels just will not do. Like Miriyam Aouragh, we think the concept of ‘white privilege’ has been increasingly exported out of the historical context of the US and deployed as a shortcut taking over the analysis of racism that is detrimental to trans- national and trans-ethnic anti-racism movements and scholarship.9 ‘Chinese privilege’ has appeared as an uncritically imported shortcut in Singapore in recent years, with little evidence to prove its existence other than the prescribed racial identities of those whose actions and articulations are being interpreted.

The result is that ‘Chinese privilege’ has become a pleasurable act of Foucauldian confes- sion by some well-intentioned Singaporeans to reinforce their feelings of goodness and purity while avoiding genuine anti-racism actions, as Claire Lockard has written of ‘white privilege’ in the US.10 The danger then is a performative discourse by scholars and such Singaporeans alike, full of sound and fury, ultimately signifying nothing. This rejoinder is important because we believe anti-racism scholarship requires critical analysis and trans-ethnic solidarities vis- a-vis all forms of racisms, not distracting shortcuts from concepts that have developed through specific histories and traumas elsewhere. The uncritical application of such shortcuts will only deepen existing racialisations and harden differences. And this will be to our collective detriment.

70,singapore,153532,In defense of SAF,am4ubc,Yeile,1549044206,33,1,"No, i am not from SAF. I am a Singaporean son that has served my duty to my country, with a few reservist cycles left.

The recent passing of the NSman from the lowering of the SSPH barrel is an unfortunate tragedy - but that is all it is. There is no blame to be placed, no accountability to be had, no good answers. 

Firstly, the NSman has had 2 years training on the SSPH platform during NS. He has also gone through 6-7 cycles of ICT - he is as familar with the platform and drills as he can be. 

When the incident happened, 2 other person were present - the detachment commander and the technician. The commander have been trained to look out for safety of the crew while carrying out the drills. The technician is essentially the system expert. These 2 people are as much ""human"" safety as you can ask for. 

Some people think the regulars should carry out the maintenance - this is wholly unrealistic in war time. There is a need for the gun crew to be self-sufficient. 

Some people ask for accountability - the immediate fault lies with the detachment commander and the technician, both are NSman as well. Do we expect SAF to give them up, and ruin the lifes of 2 functioning member of the society? Would that make future commanders more vigilant of safety, or more fearful such that they find ways to dodge NS altogether? Would the public accept this, or will they blame SAF further for ""pushing the blame to others""? Would that provide ""closure"" for the family?

Some people think that NS is unnecessary altogether, but it is such complacency that has lead to the fall of many city states in the past (eg. Venice). To put this in perspective, any singaporean man above the age of 21 can run up to any fallen Singaporean soldier, strip, assemble and load a SAR21 in under 5 minutes, and coordinate with any other soldier to defend our country. That is an incredible feat!

Assuming the investigation reveals that this incident is entirely the fault of the deceased NSman - should that be revealed to the public? Would the public accept that it's not some cover up?

Ultimately, the hands of SAF are tied. There is no good response for this incident. NS is a place to prepare for war time, and it is unrealistic to expect zero safety incidents, and with any degree of risk brings with it a degree of possible fatality. What we can ask for is due diligence, which has been fulfilled. SAF has not been negligent *specifically for this incident*. It is an unfortunate tragedy, and we should leave it at that. 

The internet is a wonderful place, but it can be a toxic place too. Just like you only see the good side of people's lives on social media, you only see the negative comments on news like this. The response is skewed because ""neutral"" people dont respond.

My recommendation is to not partake further in any such discussion - let the NSman rest in peace.

First and foremost, I’m not against NS, nor am I calling for the resignation of anyone. The purpose of this post isn’t to jump on the bandwagon and “bash” SAF, but to try to make sense of all the stories, opinions and evaluations from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aj7vlt/about_safety_protocols_in_saf_and_why_they_might/). Neither am I here to speculate about the recent accident. 

When will we ever learn? [This is the fourth training related death in the past 18 months](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/aloysius-pang-saf-training-related-death-in-18-months-mindef-11160364) and every single time we have seen the same actions being taken – Call for COI, call for safety timeout, punish a few scapegoats, wait for things to subside and repeat. The problem isn’t with the safety protocols, in fact I would go on to suggest that the safety protocols are very well written and covers most, if not all of the potential risks involved in the trainings. As several have pointed out, it’s impossible to ensure a 100% safety rate when there’s always a chance for human error. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Looking at the comments and stories posted by fellow Singaporean Sons about NS, these are the few consistent points being brought up:](https://imgur.com/a/zDenony)(Click link to read all the stories)

* Chao-keng culture - where people who are legitimately sick refuse to seek medical attention for fear of reprisals, either from platoon mates or from higher ups
* · Culture of enduring/suck-it-up – where people just endure through obvious injuries by self-medicating in order not to look weak
* · Culture of targeting people around the individual instead of him – Where higher ups threaten to extend punishments to the whole platoon because of the actions of a single person falling out/missing exercises
* Bullying of individuals who cannot keep up/blur, causing them to feel bad about pulling everyone down and resulting in them cutting corners
* · Higher ups setting time limits for tasks, which are often impossible to meet, causing individuals to cut corners in order not to get punished
* · Higher ups blatantly coercing people to do risky stuff or ignore safety protocols or risk punishment
* · Commanders blatantly ignoring statuses given by MO, insisting that they continue with the exercise, or be kept up without proper rest
* · Commanders who coerce MOs to reduce number of statuses given

Do you not see where the problem lies now? **It’s the culture that needs fixing.** Implementing more safety rules or timeouts will not help to prevent more deaths from occurring – just look at the past 18 months. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting a different result.

[There has also been discussions on why ICT needs some revamping.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aj7pr5/maybe_it_is_time_to_rethink_how_we_do_reservist/) 

&amp;#x200B;

# Here are some of the common retorts when this topic is brought up:

**Commanders give unrealistic time constraints, but you can choose not to breach safety rules what.**

Given the illusion of choice between 1)Punishment for not meeting time limits, and 2)Doing whatever it takes to meet the time limit, which requires laxation of safety protocols 

Many would gladly choose the 2nd option. At least you’d have a chance at seeing your loved ones during the weekends. But what they do not see in the heat of the moment is that there’s a chance for them to get injured or even die, all they can think about are the punishments if they don’t meet expectations.

**Commanders take safety as their #1 concern and those who are caught flouting rules will be punished.**

To do things safely, it requires more time. And in the SAF, if you are late/do not meet timings, you get punished. So equate the two together and you get “If you do things by the book safely, it means you’re gonna get punished”. So who would want to put in effort and still get punished in the end? People would choose to circumvent rules to meet timings in order to get a chance at not getting punished. 

And as /u/aSingaporean eloquently put it: “*So what’s the point of safety if one is being punished for being late for taking safety into consideration? You put NSFs in a difficult spot, then when shit hits the fan, you say “safety remains a priority”.“*

**Of course commanders would want to set time limits during trainings. After all in a war situation, every second counts.** 

We are not a professional army. Period.

So what if we can hit timings during our NSF time? After ORD then how? Still can keep timing if war come meh?

So what if you can hit timing during ICT? After the 1-2 weeks then how? You go back to your desk job still can keep timing meh?

Safety is paramount.

**This kind of toxic culture exists everywhere, even in the corporate world etc etc.**

And because this happens everywhere, the fact that it happens in the SAF can be downplayed?

Comparing the outside world(Where people have free choices and freewill) and a conscripted military service(Where people have no choice but to serve and have their rights stripped) is like comparing apples to oranges. 

Let’s take construction as an example. Construction workers **choose** to work as construction workers even when they know the potential risks. However, they are free to quit their job if they are made to circumvent safety rules which might endanger their lives(Don’t give me bull about how they are tied to contracts, they can report to MOM if their company wants them to take shortcuts and leave). 

Conscripts on the other hand have **no choice** in whether or not they want to serve. They know the potential risks of their job, but they do not have the choice on whether or not to quit. They are bound by the law - you AWOL or go against superiors, you go to DB and in the end you still have to come back to serve. 

SAF as a whole practices using fear to control the masses. “Do this or you will be confined”, “Don’t meet this and you will lose privileges”. What this does it instil a sense of fear in every soldier to follow instructions whether or not they like it, or whether or not they feel that it’s risky. To them, it’s 2 years taken away from them and all they want are the weekends to spend time with their loved ones. They would do anything to not allow their weekends to be taken away. 

So when a commander gives unrealistic timings, everyone will tend to come up with shortcuts to ensure that they hit the timing. And for those who don’t want to cut corners, they end up slowing down their team and get ostracized, bullied and have their mental health degraded. No one wants that, so that brings us back to “Just do it”.

&amp;#x200B;

# So what’s gonna happen now?

In a few months, we will all forget this issue and it will die down like all the other deaths in SAF. There’s nothing we can do about it really, but try to change the culture bit by bit(for those who are enlisting and are posted to SCS or OCS), actually even men can change the culture to be more encouraging and emphatic. Stop the bullying, stop the chao geng culture and work together as a team. 

But for now, the rage of the public against those at the top in MINDEF is at an all time high, especially with some of them making blatantly out of touch statements – [""*If any SAF soldier detects an unsafe practice, he should inform his commander or stop training to protect himself or his buddies.

76,singapore,169293,Don't you think a land scarce country like Singapore should legalize human composting?,brobw5,Eifand,1558529012,48,52,"&gt;**Washington becomes first US state to legalise human composting**  
&gt;  
&gt;Washington has become the first state in the US to legalise human composting.  
&gt;  
&gt;Under the new law, people there can now choose to have their body turned into soil after their death.  
&gt;  
&gt;The process is seen as an alternative to cremations and burials, and as a practical option in cities where land for graveyards is scarce.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the end of the composting, loved ones are given the soil, which they can use in planting flowers, vegetables or trees.  
&gt;  
&gt;The bill was signed into law by Governor Jay Inslee on Tuesday.  
&gt;  
&gt;Katrina Spade, who lobbied for the law to be introduced, founded a company that could be the first to provide the service.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Recomposition offers an alternative to embalming and burial or cremation that is natural, safe, sustainable, and will result in significant savings in carbon emissions and land usage,"" Ms Spade told Agence France-Presse.  
&gt;  
&gt;**How does it work?**  
&gt;  
&gt;Ms Spade says the process for her company, Recompose, places a body in a hexagonal steel container filled with alfalfa, wood chips and straw.  
&gt;  
&gt;The container is then shut, and the body decomposes naturally within 30 days, creating two wheelbarrows' worth of soil.  
&gt;  
&gt;Environmentally friendly burial alternatives are becoming increasingly popular.  
&gt;  
&gt;Earlier this month it was revealed that [**late actor Luke Perry was laid to rest in a ""mushroom suit"" in California**](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/48140812).  
&gt;  
&gt;The suit's creator, Jae Rhim Lee, says that it reduces the amount of toxic pollutants that are released into the environment during the body's decomposition and cremation.  
&gt;  
&gt;The process of human composting is already legal in Sweden, while natural burials - where the body is buried without a casket or with a biodegradable coffin - are legal in the UK.

77,singapore,166897,Questions about wildlife in Singapore; Part 26: Caecilians,bl46vz,kodomodragon,1557096573,31,125,"Hi r/singapore, for this week, I’m covering another group of amphibians found in Singapore, but one that most people have never heard of: the [caecilians](https://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/amphibians/yellow-striped-caecilian.htm).

There are three living groups of amphibians today. Most people are familiar with frogs and toads. People living in temperate climates in the Northern Hemisphere will also be familiar with newts and salamanders. While some newt species are present in northern Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam, they are not found in the rest of Southeast Asia. However, few people know about the third and final group of living amphibians, the caecilians.

Caecilians do not look like frogs or newts at all. Instead, they resemble worms or snakes, as they have long, limbless bodies. Many species have ring like folds encircling the body, giving them a segmented appearance like an earthworm. The tail is very short, or even absent. Most species spend their entire lives underground, using their reinforced skulls to push through the soil, which is why they are not seen by most people. As expected, since good eyesight is of little use to them, caecilians have [tiny eyes](https://flic.kr/p/mU2wi6) that are pretty much useless, only good enough to distinguish darkness and light. They have a unique sensory organ, [a retractable tentacle located on each side of the head](https://flic.kr/p/jegt9T), between the eye and the nostril. These tentacles pick up scents and chemical cues, allowing the caecilian to detect prey and navigate in the dark. 

There are more than 250 known species of caecilians, found in Central and South America, Africa, the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean, the Indian subcontinent, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia. Despite their subterranean lifestyle, some species are [brightly coloured](https://flic.kr/p/Uv84AP), and like other amphibians, caecilians produce copious amounts of mucus and other skin secretions, and some are known to be toxic. Some South American species are [aquatic](http://www.ryanphotographic.com/typhlonectidae.htm), and are called “rubber eels” in the exotic pet trade (although they aren’t actually eels).

Caecilians breathe through lungs, although they also absorb oxygen via the skin and mouth, and one bizarre species lacks lungs altogether. While many salamanders and one frog species also do not possess lungs, relying entirely on the skin for respiration, the lungless caecilian (also nicknamed the [‘penis snake’](https://news.mongabay.com/2012/08/penis-snake-discovered-in-brazil-is-actually-a-rare-species-of-amphibian/) because of its appearance) is special in that at 81 cm in length, it is the largest lungless tetrapod (the group of vertebrates that encompasses amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals).

Despite their dopey appearance, caecilians are predators, feeding on insects, earthworms, and other invertebrates, with larger species capable of taking vertebrates such as small fishes, frogs, lizards, and even small snakes as prey. Prey is typically seized with the jaws, which are [lined with rows of sharp teeth](https://www.sciencesource.com/archive/Caecilian-Mouth-SS2570828.html), and then swallowed whole.

Unlike frogs, in which the vast majority of species use external fertilisation, and salamanders, where the majority of species use internal fertilisation, all caecilians use internal fertilisation; males have a [phallodeum](https://www.sciencesource.com/archive/Caecilian-Phallodeum-SS2570827.html), a tube-like organ that is inserted into the cloaca of the female. About a quarter of known caecilian species lay soft, gelatinous eggs, which are guarded by the female until they hatch, while the rest give birth. In some species that give birth to their young, the unborn young already possess teeth, and get their nourishment by gnawing on the walls of their mother’s oviducts. This triggers the production of a special secretion called ‘uterine milk’, which the baby caecilians continue to consume until they are born. In some egg-laying species from South America and Africa, the female develops an outer layer of skin, high in fat and other nutrients. After hatching, the babies swarm around their mother, [ripping off and eating chunks of her skin](https://youtu.be/DMvL4zOLSeM) every few days, enough time for her to regenerate her skin. Thanks to this diet, the baby caecilians grow dramatically, and are soon large and strong enough to be completely independent.

Out of the 10 known families of caecilians, only 1, the Ichthyophiidae, is present in Southeast Asia. Both of the species recorded from Singapore belong to the genus *Ichthyophis* (literally Greek for ‘fish snake’). However, very little is known about our caecilians; there have been only a small handful of records, and in fact, one species, the so-called Singapore Caecilian (*Ichthyophis singaporensis*), is only known from a single specimen, collected from Singapore in the 19th century. The other species, the Yellow-banded Caecilian (*Ichthyophis paucisulcus*), is known from 5 sightings in recent decades, 2 in the 1980s, 1 in the 1990s, and 2 more this decade. I’ll go into further detail in follow-up comments. 

Based on these few records, as well as related species from other parts of Southeast Asia, what we do know about our caecilians is that they live underground. Females guard their eggs in burrows near streams, and the young are aquatic. They look like miniature versions of the adults, but have gill slits and a tail fin, spending their time in the water before eventually turning into fully terrestrial adults. 

Feel free to ask any questions you might have about caecilians, and I'll try to answer them to the best of my ability. Given that most people aren’t even aware of their existence, I don’t think there will be many here with their own stories or anecdotes to share about caecilians, but feel free to suggest other animals for me to cover in future.

In 1882, [George Albert Boulenger](https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/37286865) referred this specimen to another species, *Ichthyophis monochrous*, the name commonly given to Southeast Asian caecilians that were all dark brown or black and lacked yellow stripes.\n\nThen in 1960, Edward Harrison Taylor examined many caecilian specimens that had once been classified as either *Ichthyophis glutinosus* or *Ichthyophis monochrous*, and decided that this Singapore specimen was sufficiently distinct to be [described as a new species](https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/4377057), *Ichthyophis singaporensis*.\n\nUnfortunately, this is all we have of this species. It has not been recorded anywhere else in Southeast Asia, so it’s possible that it is endemic here. However, given the lack of subsequent records, we still know next to nothing.

Nobody knows. Hopefully a second specimen will turn up one day.\n\nAs an aside, the name *Ichthyophis glutinosus* now refers to a species endemic to Sri Lanka, while *Ichthyophis monochrous* now refers to a species only known from parts of Sarawak and Kalimantan.']"

I have friends who have very hectic jobs but still take night classes for their part time masters and friends who tutor after their full time jobs. 

I go to partner dance classes and the instructors have so much energy to give while teaching and meeting new students, even though most of then have full time jobs in the day as well. And I've read (from sg finance reddits) that many of you have income from the side as well.

I have so much respect for those of you who give every ounce of energy you have to improving yourself or to being productive or successful. For me, any time I spent that's not enjoyable to me is wasted time. 

For every hour I spend working or being miserable, I feel entitled to 5 hours of laziness and doing nothing productive. It's an extremely toxic mindset that I've been aware that I have for many years, but I just can't get rid of it.

I know it's just common sense to work hard now and enjoy the fruits of labour later but what if there are no fruits to be had? There's ALWAYS a risk that hard work would go to waste (be it luck, timing, or just simpley the lack of ability) so my brain refuses to do anything more than the minimum. Yet, my brain is also aware that the minimum is not enough to survive in the modern economy. My brain is just stupid AND stubborn.

Have any of you managed to get rid of this laziness mindset? I do know of discipline, I've used it so much during school. 

But now that im working, I feel that the road is endless and that hard work is not worth it without luck. I don't even want to be a disciplined person, despite knowing how absolutely necessary it is to be happy. Because I can't stop thinking that the risk of failing is just too high to be worth it, regardless of what goal I choose to pursue.

There have been so many instances of people complaining about bosses being anal about MC, having to waste day getting an MC for a single day, HR being too restrictive of medical leaves etc, both here on reddit and irl.

My perspective is that, we add value to our work place by virtue of what we do and the effort we put in, and things like medical leave should be ours to utilize. Somehow there's a culture of fear built around taking medical leave, and people show up to work feeling sick, sniffling, either because they think they can weather it out, or because they're a reluctance to take mc because of workplace culture issues. The consequence is that they feel like shit at work, increase the risk of spreading nasty illnesses around, and in the process become a bigger hindrance to workplace efficacy than if they'd just taken that damn day off.

Here on r/singapore, shitty bosses have been blamed, SMEs have been blamed, toxic work culture has been blamed, errant employees have been blamed. While it's easy to bemoan the fate of things and 'suck thumb lor', I'm keen to figure out how to change this, at least on an immediate level, and in a way that adds to the quality of life of the people around me, how ever small that may be.

Understandably, workplace culture can be really hard to change. But there has to be something that we - as employees - can do, to bring about some change, or at least get the conversation going. Any small win is a win.

I am a fresh grad from a local university who just got a very lucrative job offer. The downside is that I must work in the United States, specifically California. It doesn’t sound like a downside for you guys, but bear with me.

This is a literal golden ticket; my parents live in a rented HDB all their lives and they are super happy. However, I’m not, in fact, I fear for my life. I’ve been watching the news recently and it seems that in the past month, there has been 3 mass shootings, with more than 40 dead. The fact that people were targeted at random doesn’t sit well with me. Singapore is super safe, we have zero cases of mass shootings/stabbings/punching. If you are not part of some pai kia group, I’m sure you would have not gotten punched/stabbed for absolutely no reason. Of course, we are the exception, not the norm and things like pickpocketing/robberies are common in other places. However, I don’t mind getting robbed or mugged, for I can get a new iPhone, but if you're shot and killed, you can not get a new life.

It seems that people in the USA are unfazed and are more concerned about “government taking away their guns”, which leads me to think that they already accept mass shootings as part of life or their “freedom”.

My friends are telling me that I am thinking too much and being kiasi. Some of my friends are telling me to “give them the job”, which shows that even Singaporeans aren't as kiasi as me. Here are some reasons my friends gave me:

* I’m more likely to get into an accident than a mass shooting. But I disagree, because if you take precautions, I believe your mortality rate will be lower. I’m guessing it could be lower than getting into a mass shooting, at least in the USA.
* USA has crime, but Singapore jobs stressful. If I work in Singapore, I’ll most likely to get super stressed and work till I die. I’ve never interned before and I do not know if Singapore work environment is really toxic compared to the USA. I mean, Reddit keeps saying that US has bad employment laws, with no mandatory annual or sick leave. How can the US be better then? (Note: I haven’t gotten my benefits listing)
* US has higher pay. Well, that’s true. But at what cost? Is that increased risk of random killings worth the pay increase? It’s funny that companies pay the most in the USA but not in places like Singapore or UK. Why though?

I’m still hesitant to sign the contract and the deadline is fast approaching. I’m not asking you guys to make the decision for me, but to help me ease my fears of getting my head blown up because some guy didn’t get to piak and hates the world. It will be good to hear from fellow Singaporean Redditors who are in the USA, about their experiences with crime in the US.

I'm curious about what people's thoughts on dating, marriage, and family building are. 

Among my closer friends (we're quite liberal), most of us don't plan on getting married and having kids, and my female friends don't seem to be as concerned as most people are about the rubbish that society / the government tells them about them being walking time bombs that have an expiry date at which they won't be able to give birth (as if that's supposed to be a major purpose in their lives). 

It seems to be a different story among my friends from secondary school and junior college, who seem quite happy to be 26 years old and getting married and having kids, which I find quite boring but good for whoever wants this life.

Personally, after my first relationship (which was a totally healthy one with a guy who was great and not at all toxic; it just didn't work out) I renounced the whole relationship thing and decided that, at least for now, ephemeral sexual relationships are better for me. It honestly doesn't get lonely because I've always seen myself as self-sufficient and fiercely independent, and being in a relationship made me realize how silly it is that society and the media keeps telling us that we need to find The One if not just Someone to spend eternity with. A better half to complete us, as if we are incomplete without someone else.

I guess being gay means that I'm automatically excluded from the whole narrative of dating to find a girlfriend who will become my wife who will become the mother of my kids with whom i'll spend the rest of my life with. But it baffles me how there are people I know who just want to be a part of that family-centric narrative, even in 2019 where we are in a better position than previous generations to critique cultural norms and decide on what kind of life we want. It's not entirely surprising; the government micromanages everything about life in Singapore to such an extent that our wants get shaped by the national agenda. But I'm curious, what are y'all's thoughts about dating, marriage, and family-building? What role do these things have in how you make your life decisions?

Myself:
Never a problematic kid, playful in my younger days but matured along the years. Do not unnecessarily cause problems, pretty much your average joe you see everywhere. Came from a below-average neighbourhood Sec school but worked hard to land myself a  placement in tertiary education before a Uni placement in one of the “3”. Currently serving  NS while awaiting for uni commencement.

Mum on the other hand is pretty much a Tiger Mum, full of ego and never admit to wrongdoings. Extremely defensive when it comes to disputes especially when things don’t go her way. Goes mad over my “rude, unfilial,disrespectful” behaviour whenever I attempt to speak up or voice my opinions Fails to realise that I’m a product of her. She’s also very protective of my younger sibling ever since he was born. Won’t go into details but the bias and treatment has been pretty obvious to me.

It can be pretty depressing for me whenever I see my peers having a close relationship with their parents. I really envy them being able to laugh, share secrets, show affection to their parents so comfortably. For my case, perhaps the bias sibling treatment made things hard in the beginning, but I still feel having a close relationship with my mum is just not plausible right now. Mum is increasingly becoming hot tempered as she ages as well. It bizarres me how she don’t realise or understand that I’m not a “bad” kid all these years. I don’t intentionally cause trouble inside and outside of home, I work hard in my education so that I can provide for my family in the future, so what more does she want?

I do admit she helps and provide for me in certain areas, financially and house chores for instance,since she makes the decision in the household most of the time.

However, my health has gotten significantly better in the past 6 months, and I’m looking for advice and help on overcoming the administrative difficulties in so doing. Be it hearsay or your experience, I’m much appreciative of your inputs. Thank you.

Here goes my story as an ASA. I ooced from PTP BMT and was down PES subsequently due to a chronic disease. It was pretty bad initially because I was unaware of it and only found it out later. But after months of medication and treatments at a gov hospital, my condition has finally stabilised. Later, I was posted to become an ASA. 

That’s where I learned about the office politics. Life is not fair, people are paid by ranks, not by their competency in the works they do. There are regulars working their ass off their non-working hour all day and still be criticised by their superiors just because some other DXOs know how to wayang better and slack all day. The DXOs that wayang know well how to dump most of their works to poor NSFs under them, and if things go wrong, they just push all the blames to NSF, even though the NSF involved has zero stake in it and might not be responsible for that piece of work. Of course, the regulars would be “fucked” the hardest but the verbal abuse and extras to NSF are totally uncalled for. Each regular has one or two assistants(NSFs) to support him or her. It feels really bad and demoralising because you are the only one that suffers as compared to all the men take it together in the combat units. I’m not saying combat vocation is by any standard easier, but a toxic culture and a lack of peer support can take a toll on one’s mental health.

Furthermore, if u somehow can do computer saikang faster, like in one-tenth of the time(check up excel vba and macro) that took others hours more to do, instead of a compliment, u received hella more works to do just because u don’t look “busy”. That’s how I learned to mask my competency to reduce the ridiculous workloads being thrown onto me. Act blurs lives longer is sadly true here. 

Of course combat vocation is more difficult and there are power-hungry commanders out there, but I’m more confident to survive it with my buddy and platoon mates:)

I already have a strained and estranged relationship with him, where I do not talk more than 10 times to him in a year. And it is the same with my sister. I have a mother who is illiterate and does not understand how society norms work and I do not get financial support, emotional support from her as well. Following the anger of my father, I questioned him about the 10k debt that he incurred but is in my name, he revealed that he does not have the means to even pay a bit back monthly (which I asked him to, as it shows that he still have some responsibility in him). He flared up a lot of times during the quarrel and even threw things. I tried to calm down as well and asked him nicely and asked if he could talk to my sister and have it debted under her name instead as she is the one earning the most for now. Instead, he said that she doesn't have the money and I asked why should it be under my name then and he concluded that he will sell the house.   


My father and I had a talk with one of the HDB advisor a few months back and selling the house back to HDB would mean a fixed sum sold back to us and we could only rent the current house for a few more years and then we will need to find our own places. Which of course, is a risky solution. My father kept insisting that he can sell the house and we will still have the house to live which confuses me, because this wasn't what the advisor has mentioned and he refused to explain further and simply dismissed me. I tried to call Income (the company that we are in debt to) but I broke down during the call and when a staff came on, I wasn't in a state to question why was the 10k+ debt simply credited to me just because my dad had bought an insurance policy for me years ago when I was smaller without my consent and why isn't the debt credited to my elder sister instead when she is the eldest.   


I'm in midst of a national exams and it had already been a stressful period, managing my studying, finances, health and depression. Earlier on this year, I had severe negative and suicidal thoughts which I managed to get out of after breaking off a toxic relationship. My self-harm relapsed again after a 10-year period during the relationship too. I've been struggling with other issues too but I keep trying to feel better and I did but negative thoughts seeps back constantly and new issues keeps popping up. I have little to no means of relief. Today I just found out that the dad I tried to think good of, cared for despite his negligence in bringing me up is a selfish, bad tempered, unreasonable, biased, irresponsible father.

101,singapore,0,Should I risk burning bridges for a better job opportunity?,83foox,musingsofprogress,1520694694,46,45,"I work in a small organization in an executive role. My organization has a history of toxic work culture, poor management and a high  turnover rate from all the issues adding up. However, the current manager is here to stay because she is related to a board member.  Despite half of the workforce leaving or going part-time in the past year alone, as well as several more leaving during her two-year reign. 

My manager has pushed many of her own duties to me even though I'm unqualified to deal with them (e.g. HR recruitment for new staff when I have no such training or experience and given ZERO budget), which affected my efficiency on my own core duties. When she harped on that, I explained that she was the one who told me whatever tasks she gave was important and urgent so I dealt with them first. Upon which, she appeared to be sympathetic and said I should say no to her when my plate is full. 

Yet whenever I stood my ground and did what she advised me to, she would turn around and be passive-aggressive the whole day and even scolded me on my “poor time management” and how I was “unhelpful in a lean workforce”.  I'm basically my own department due to the sheer workload and the one other functioning executive there is  too overwhelmed by her own duties as well as both of us having to clean up after the senior colleagues who feign ignorance to avoid work.

Recently, I went for job interviews and received a job offer for a much bigger organization in the sector with the highest salary I have ever been offered.

The new organization wants me to start work exactly a month later, from the time they called me with the verbal offer, which I’m unable to since I'm the main driving force behind a major company event in the next month. The new company is also unwilling to wait for me any longer than that. 

Based on what I have witnessed, almost all the previous employees who left were younger and bad-mouthed by both the management and long-staying colleagues alike even though past documentation proved that they pulled their weight at work.

My manager has also taken credit for work done by younger employees and scapegoated them for her mistakes, which works in her favour since most of the workforce are older than 50 years and they gang up together to complain about millenials (of which I am the only one there) and talking about how much better their generation is.

If I leave at this crucial time before the event, I would most certainly incur the wrath of the entire board (of influential big shots who only rely on the manager for news about the operations) and I can forget about any good references. I would also forfeit my performance bonus if I resigned before this month is up (as stated in our HR rules).

The new organization also has this clause in their application forms whereby they can terminate me at any time if they seem me unfit through their research.

If I pass on the new org's offer and stay until I complete the big event, I might never get the same opportunity again, given that the new org is one of the biggest in the industry with so much growth potential. We have other smaller events after the big event which might earn their ire but at least they have more time to hire my replacement.

In the worst case scenario, I resign, forfeit my bonus and join the new org before completing my company's big event. The management and board become enraged and badmouth me to the new org when they make a reference check. New org terminates me and I am left without a job and potentially blacklisted since the industry is small here.

I like what I do in this industry and I want to stay within it if possible.

Should I take the risk and burn bridges in my current organization for a better opportunity at the new org? I'm worried it will come back to bite me one day. Or should I give up on this job offer so I can finish the event and leave the org on less hostile terms?

Ideally, I want to avoid the worst case scenario. But I don't know how to even begin countermeasures or if there is any I could do in the first place. Any ideas?

However, I think I might end up with no job now. The new company just called me up and asked me when I would submit the resignation letter, so they can call up my HR for a reference check.

The very same HR who is my manager's relative and relys solely on my biased manager for information since she is not in the office.

My organization suffers from a high turnover rate despite our small size of less than 10 employees. I'm the 4th person to be in my role in as many years and have already outlasted all my predecessors at just over a year here.

The manager and senior colleagues (who are a clique) have had nothing good to say about all the female predecessors and all of the praises for the one guy who worked here, even though past records show that the ladies were pulling their weight while the guy did the bare minimum and left after 5 months. 

There is a high probability of the manager outright bad-mouthing me because I politely refused some of the more unreasonable demands (e.g. excessively taking on the daily workload of said senior colleagues and herself because ""at this age, they aren't familiar with the Internet and you should respect your seniors"") when I'm overworked. She has been passive aggressive towards me ever since.

She's the only in-charge since we are a small organization and the board relys solely on her for information.

- Insulting me a lot: one of her favorite things to do is to come into my room, insult me and my life for about 2hrs until I break down. 

I don’t think I’m a bad human; I have a good job and I don’t stay out late. I don’t party or drink. Only thing is that I do devote my Saturdays to my BF of a year, which she hates bc I don’t spend as much time with her anymore (we used to go out on weekends a lot when I was single). 

- she throws tantrums when my stepdad and I don’t do things her way. 

Eg. She’s very religious but we aren’t as much. She hasn’t spoken to me in 2 months because I missed a prayer session which she finds extremely important

- I once told her that I had to go for therapy coz depression coz of her toxic attitude and she shouted at me for an hour, saying that I’m the worst daughter ever and that I’m weak in the head

- I feel terrible and unhappy being at home because it’s like living with a time bomb

- I always try to please her but nothing ever makes her completely happy

106,singapore,122546,"A rant, to MOE and TJC",8l7by8,ImpreciseChaos,1526964109,14,0," For saying this, some of you may call me an idealist; naïve. Some of you may think I’m wasting my time and all of your time, but with all my heart I want to believe you’re wrong. And I truly hope you’re wrong.

 You see, I believe that education should be the process through which students learn. Simple enough… to say. Our education system was built upon our founding fathers’ necessity; that we as a growing nation should strive to produce workers, the sole resource of our nation, to survive. And it was good, for as long as it was necessary. No longer. To survive, and to progress, we must change. We must revolutionise education.

 I think our education system is fundamentally flawed, and it will not carry our generation and the generations after us into the future. Right now, our education, as Sir Ken Robinson put it, is ‘a protracted process of university entrance’. It does not aim to teach, nor encourage learning. It aims to produce graduates. Teachers don’t teach for students to learn, they teach so students can answer exam questions. Students don’t go to school to learn, they go to school so after they graduate they get a piece of paper that says ‘okay you can go to university now’. School leaders aren’t encouraging teachers to engage and inspire, but driving them to get their students to achieve ever higher results. The very purpose of education has been subverted by our overemphasis on grades and examinations; on academia, instead of learning.

 So, what can we do about that? We need to start valuing education, in its entirety. No more hypocrisy, no more stigmatisation. We need to start valuing autonomy and individuality. My education should not be numbers on a screen; your 85s and 90s. My education should not be a statistic; your 60%s and 96%s. And my education should, least of all, be a competition with another school! We need to start recognising that students are different and we shouldn’t force, nor expect them to conform to a rigid system. We need to stop talking about ‘holistic education’ and then emphasising on academic grades. You cannot admit ‘yes, hobbies are important’ and then say ‘you need to get As and Bs’ in the same sentence! While it is possible for some of us, for most of us, it is an impossibility to enjoy our hobbies and score As and Bs! It is not an issue of our time management or how much hard work we put in because some of us are just different! We have different interests, and all our minds and bodies are built differently. Some of us can’t study at home. Some of us can’t study in school. Some of us can’t study in the morning and some of us at night. You cannot force everyone to stay for night study and expect everything to work out because it won’t. Trust me, I’ve tried for 8 years to study like everyone else does. I’ve tried literally everything. I’ve tried coffee and staying awake at night to study. Didn’t work, couldn’t focus. I’ve tried going to the living room to study. Failed. I’ve tried waking up before the crack of dawn to study. Didn’t work. I’ve tried timetables and schedules. Didn’t work. I’ve tried listening to heavy music to keep me awake. Turns out I really like metal and rock so I passed out. I’ve tried listening to really calming music so I could focus. Yeah, no I passed out. I’ve finally found my way to study, that is, I have to study in school, but these methods were all suggested to me by people who’ve tried it and who it worked for. Some of these work for you and you know it. It didn’t for me. Trust me. We’re all different. You can’t say ‘hey, she can balance all of her work and still do CCA and still do sports and hobbies, so why can’t you?’. Elon Musk built a rocket. What are all of you doing? If you said ‘I didn’t want to build a rocket’, well we don’t want to be here. But when we have to, you can’t expect us to do the things the ones of us who fit into the system can do because a lot of us are not built for the system. You can’t press a human being into a cookie cutter.

 Right now, we need change. Adding more to the system won’t work. Things need to change, and that means old fundamentals need to be replaced, completely. Our society can no longer subsist on the workers our system is fit to build, our system needs thinkers. Innovators and revolutionaries of the new age. We need to place less emphasis on standardised testing, and see it for the value it actually holds; content diagnosis, instead of as judge of character and will. I’ve had friends whom I’ve witnessed worked their butts off, but got nowhere, and friends who were naturally born with gifts that gave them an invitation to NUS High before PSLE begun so they sat back and relaxed. I’ve had friends who were terrible to teachers and showed no respect who got into RI, and friends who are the nicest, kindest people I know be pushed aside into ITE, not by choice but by virtue of their grades. I digress. Standardised testing should help us figure out how much a student is learning and what they need help with, but it shouldn’t be the focus of education, and less so a judge of character! Instead, teachers should be motivated to encourage and inspire students and to engage them in the subject matter, instead of just teaching them dead content and how to answer exam questions. Then, there will be a greater reason to appreciate teachers because they will be mentors to us, not instructors. Side note about teenagers, we like to be seen as equals, and we can always tell if you respect us. And if you do, chances are we will respect you too. Yelling at us to shut up in the lecture theatres is not effective. For this to happen, teachers also need greater autonomy. The syllabus needs to allow for teachers to have the time to plan lessons and care for their students and care for themselves. If the teachers are stressed and unhappy, the teaching and learning environment becomes hostile and toxic very quickly. Additionally, we need to stop glorifying university and people who’ve done well academically. Degrees no longer guarantee jobs; the number of unemployed degree-holders has been increasing every year. Yet the number of jobs in creative avenues have been increasing; jobs that don’t require degrees. The success rates of someone who pursues a music or creative writing career is no smaller than the success rate of a restaurateur or start-up. We need to stop discouraging children from pursuing jobs in creative fields or pursuing creative interests. Chances are, they will have a job in a creative field without a related degree just as soon as they will find one in another field with their degree. We also need to stop stigmatising mistakes. There should be no stupid questions in classrooms and if teachers don’t punish or stop students asking questions, no matter whether or not you’ve already went through it in class, then students won’t laugh at each other for asking questions and you’ve created a learning environment. Getting low marks in a test should be a call for support and not for reprimand!

 We cannot expect the system to change, because it hasn’t and it doesn't know how to. Change needs to start with universities, not preschools, because even if you change things at preschools, with universities as the end in the minds of parents and educators, children will be forced back into conformity. We need to acknowledge the problems present in our current system, and then push for change. We may no longer be stakeholders of this system when the changes we push for are made, but those after us will be. And I don’t know about you, but I don’t want them to suffer the ‘education’ I had. Education should be fulfilling. It should be respectful. It should be the process through which students learn.

108,singapore,121102,"Dear SAF, It's time for change",8hcs3r,Kiasu_K,1525579323,89,526,"The recent passing of CFC Dave has sparked fierce online debates on the treatment of National Servicemen-Full Time (NSFs). An online account allegedly written by a platoon mate of the deceased read like an explosive exposé, which, if true, depicts a clear overstepping of boundaries by the serviceman’s superiors. 

For some, it was confirmation of SAF’s toxic culture of power abuse and its leaders’ mentality of “anything is possible as long as you can get away with it”. For older NSmen, it was a rude awakening that even after 20/30 years of completing their NS where they were forced to participate in illegal, tortuous activities forced on them by their superiors, these activities are still carried out and are fully ingrained in the “culture of the unit and experience of current servicemen”, something which is almost explained in an endearing way.

Regardless of the investigation outcome, there are definitely ways for the SAF to improve on its work processes. This is most evident in any online army-related comment section where servicemen (current and ex) often share how protocols are not followed properly, and collectively expressing doubt if the true cause of CFC Dave’s death would be revealed to the public.  

The very fact that we are not dismissing this online account shows that our faith in army superiors to do the right thing is non-existent. With so many other personal experiences being shared, the platoon mate’s account of CFC Dave do not look out of place.

This is a military me-too movement in the making. 

As such, I would like to highlight some issues which SAF should (hopefully) examine and when necessary, change work protocols for the better.


**1) Adequate sleep for every combat soldier**
7 hours of mandatory, uninterrupted rest is not the rest you are thinking of – instead of sleep, activities such as cleaning your rifles and area cleaning are apparently considered part of that 7 hours. 

Our soldiers go through tough training programmes in intense heat conditions. Perhaps it is time to define a specific number of hours set aside from sleeping. After all, with all the wait to rush, rush to wait situations, there is definitely enough time to accommodate at least 6 hours of uninterrupted SLEEP. 


**2) Rethink guilt-tripping as a leadership tactic**
“Chao keng” is by far the most common phrase used to guilt trip already sick soldiers into completing an activity or work task. It works because the embarrassment and humiliation one would like to avoid, which would likely last until the end of the course or even ORD. 

Peer pressure also contributes to this formidable tactic. A sick soldier might see others who are sicker than him but they do not report sick and fall-out, convincing him that he is not sick enough to do so too.

And the reason for the others to grit their teeth and endure through the training? Not to be humiliated – it is a vicious cycle which has undoubtedly led to many mishaps. This peer pressure is real, and much more intense when one is 18-20+ years of age. 

What happened to ‘you know your body best’? Superiors should never decide determine whether or not one can report sick, as it is a right. Cut out all the useless gossip and chao keng complaints and give soldiers the benefit of the doubt – reserve judgement till after the diagnosis by the MO. 


**3) Treating every sick personnel with respect and care**
We are all human; we can fall ill, especially during tough training sessions with not enough sleep. Reporting sick is by no means a form of weakness or sign of giving up – it simply means that the solider believes he is too sick to carry on with the tasks assigned to him. 

Superiors should care for men under their charge, which includes the time when the men are sick. Showing care and concern is a leadership trait which our superiors should have.

There are MOs who also act unprofessionally. These ""doctors"" carry a disgruntled look on their faces and are rude, with some going as far to assume you are a chao keng soldier until being examined. Such MOs should be called out for having such behaviours and have their vocations changed if they do not have a heart for their patients.

If the online account of what happened to CFC Dave is true (read: lack of seriousness towards the incident), this is not only a gross violation of military law, but also evidence of a highly deplorable and immoral attitude they have towards men under their supposed care. 


**4) Concrete evidence and corroboration; No wayang safety measures**
There is a reason why public trust of the SAF is low, with some going as far to say that evidence will be buried, witnesses will be silenced and the investigation would be a cover-up in disguise. Many servicemen have experienced injustice during their time in NS, and they know that culture of pushing responsibilities plays a big part in navigating the politics of the organisation. 

Now that a soldier has passed on, we deserve the right to know the truth, so additional preventive measures can be put into place for soldiers to participate in the safest training programmes possible. 

Anyone can make a generic statement which reads “temperature takings were normal prior to training activity”. A statement from the Chief of Army would rely on the verbal testimony of those present at that time (likely the commanders) to make that statement, as he was not there for the training on that day. 

Would it be better to have more concrete evidence than to just rely on witness’ verbal testimonies? A simple written record of the soldier’s temperature, witnessed and signed by the soldier’s buddies can immediately squash any doubt of false statements. It is a safer and more transparent way to seek the truth should an investigation take place. 

These measures will ensure that superiors do not just simply go through the motion of conducting safety checks without paying close attention to any warning signs exhibited by the soldiers. It is only through added measures of written records then can we be sure of effectiveness of the safety measures being put in place.


**5) Full immunity results in true testimonies**
I am in no position to comment on how the COI works, as I am unfamiliar with the investigation process, but this is to reiterate what CFC Dave’s aunts already said – CFC Dave was training alongside his buddies, section mates and platoon mates. There were at least 2 pair of eyes keeping track of his progress and to ensure attention is brought to him when something goes wrong. 

Each platoon member should be probed on what happened that fateful day, and no stone should be left unturned for the truth to be told. If the accusations of CFC Dave’s commanders are true, there would be an understandable fear of coming forward and agreeing with the whistle-blower. Just think, who knows what the commanders would do to punish them for telling the truth?

This is why the independent investigators should obtain full witness accounts of the training, with every detail of the incident documented and used for consideration of the investigation findings.  


**6) One of us died, at least act like you care.**
So far, the statements from the SAF were nothing short of cold and scripted, suggesting that his death is nothing more than a ‘problem which can be solved’. Worse still, it was in bad taste for one of the statements to include a statistic which boasted a track record of “no recorded fatalities in the past nine years (as a result of training measures)”. The soldier is more than just a red, underlined statistic in a report, and one death is one too many. Have a thought for the grieving family and spare them the report numbers. 

Stop the ‘damage control’ mode and address the root of the problem. Whether the death was caused by the superiors’ lack of ability to lead **does not** change the fact that there are problems in the SAF which needs serious fixing.



I believe in the concept of NS, and I agree that we have progressed since its inception, which deserves celebration, like how we did last year during SG50. But some problems are too large to ignore, and with an unverified online account of the circumstances which led to CFC Dave’s passing, it completely changed the narrative of how the public perceive the army. We cannot let these problems continue to endanger the lives of our men, and destroy public trust in the army. 

Acknowledging the problems is the first step to positive change, and the burden is on us to ensure that they pay attention to these issues. To be apathetic about it would only endanger future generations of soldiers.

111,singapore,125271,"Psychologically and physically abusive mother, what should I do?",8s8vya,whojiayi,1529415158,48,85,"Hello everyone. I'll try to keep this brief, but I do suspect this will be a long post.

So I currently half way through university and **I have two siblings (sister and brother) in primary school**. My mother's temper has gotten extremely unpleasant for the **past three years** but I have learnt to tolerate. What I worry is **the impact of her actions on my young siblings in the long run**. (I'm already suffering from episodes of depression and anxiety due to her harsh upbringing, but thank goodness I've got a good support system from my close friends and significant other.)

For several times a week, if not daily, my mom screams at my siblings, **instilling fear** to make them obey. Her voice will travel throughout the neighbourhood and echo back, and I'm not exaggerating. Initially **she will regularly beat them**causing several bruises on their arms, legs and buttocks, but it has since gotten less frequent but not entirely gone.

Once my sister's primary school teacher asked her about her bruises and the teacher called home to advise my mom. After the call, rather than reflecting on her actions, my mom **beat my sister even more and** **threatened to hit her again if she tell her teacher about it next time.** My mom is constantly **intimidating my siblings** to order them around and do what she says. Upon knowing that my mom regularly beats my sister for her wrong doings (*even if it's very minute like taking 2h to do her homework, but at least she does her homework and has good results in a top/elite primary school in Singapore*), her teacher spoke to me and told me that she will no longer call home to complain about my sister being a little mischievous in school, unless completely necessary. My sister can sometimes be a little bit more mischievous in school as her actions at home are completely controlled by my mom.

Today, while I was out with my SO, my sister messaged me and sent me a audio recording of my mom scolding my dad. It's not even close to what she's capable of doing, but it is all the evidence I have right now.

[Here is the link](https://vocaroo.com/i/s0PvQk7lMDCo)

to the audio recording, it gets worse at 2:00 mark and at 3:00 she can be heard beating my dad. My sister has also suffered from bruises on her arm. It's in dialect so can be difficult to understand.

Here is the conversation I had with my sister.

*Processing img cj34o8itmy411...*

*Processing img w7a5lcdumy411...*

*Processing img 4t2e8b1vmy411...*

It doesn't get easier for my dad as well. In the morning she could be seen joking with him, in the afternoon she could be screaming and hitting him, threatening to leave Singapore. She **blames my father for her unhappiness and problems**when in fact, all she does is stay at home all day while my dad is outside busy working and taking home a decent amount of income. **She is extremely toxic to be around and emotional outbursts are unpredictable**, but usually my dad does not stop her as he is not someone who is confrontational. **Basically, I have never seen her resolve a problem logically, but either by force or mental intimidation.**

For me, she has never acknowledged my depression and anxiety caused by her abusiveness when I was young, and asked me to basically ""**man up and get over it.**"" I have stopped talking to her since. It has been almost half a year since we last spoke. To my mom, **she's always right and will never admit any mistakes**. It is extremely difficult to talk to her about the issue and I have stopped trying. I will be moving out in the coming years to avoid the toxicity so I can't be bothered anymore.

**I don't want my siblings to grow up and suffer the same kind of anxiety and depression that I have been suffering.** I just wish for a forgiving and nurturing learning environment for them.

112,singapore,132357,How do you get over a friendship break up?,9bhi40,benignalpha,1535613688,15,13,"LONG STORY SHORT — I was really close to this friend of mine, maybe it was one sided, but it was mutual for at least 2 years till i had a fall out with one of our close friend, and then left the friendship with another one because she felt too toxic for me, and I found out she had been talking bad about me behind my other friends backs as well although I defended her rumours for 2 years.


Anyways, back to this close friend. Me and her are close as in, CLOSE. Went to camp together and slept in the same tent and did everything together. Friends since 2015. I was in love with our platonic friendship and I trusted her in everything, my family issues and my anxiety. She was always there for me.

Flash forward, since the fall out in Feb we hadn’t talked. Sometimes we talk for class purposes, and I found out she blocked me one day and confronted her. She brought out the fact that now she’s looking for a more ‘chill’ FS (which I don’t get, our friendship was quite chill. We had good humour and comfort.) And I should focus on my other friends.

(In all honesty, I don’t trust a lot of my new ‘friends.’ They feel distant. I only trust her.)

Now I just know that she doesn’t want to be friends with me based on the way she phrased it. I don’t know whether it’s my fault, maybe I did something wrong but she didn’t mention it so I just can’t change myself. 

I lie in bed a lot, since Feb. I think of her sometimes and feel pain and just tear up or cry. First few months were the worst, I couldn’t walk past her without feeling like my chest was pried open. I blame myself, sometimes her, sometimes the toxic friend, and then imagine murderous tendency. A close senior of mine knew about this and he recommended therapy. 

Any suggestion? Much appreciated. Thank you.

My taste in men have been deteriorating, recently I just got out of the most toxic relationship in my life dating this horrendous looking guy. 
I honestly nvr cared abt looks, until now I still don’t. Bt I thought if I dated someone bad looking, they will appreciate whoever wants them. 
Bt who knew they can be so toxic. Having been rejected from ppl, I suppose he himself knows where he stands in terms of looks. He focused on his career/Education, in which I admire. 
But rn,.. I feel like it has morphed him into a egoistic man. he always think he’s above me. 
I Guess it’s true in he sense that he was from a local uni, unlike me. And that his job is 1000x more impt than my education. Cause I’m still a student, and he’s alrdy a working adult. Whenever I’m studying, doing my assignments, I gotta put my life on hold to pick up his call.  Bt if I get upset ( nt angry Bt disappointed that he keeps postponing dinner with me), I’m told to be more understanding. “I’m working ! U only study study !! Bt I’m working!” So on all the nasty worse like. I’m a bitch. I don uds a single shit. 
;(. I have my troubles too, Bt all I can do is to apologise to avoid quarrels.

Wa really this is the guy singaporeans chose to bring to fame? The guy who ridicules, insults, defames &amp; bullies other media influencers based on his own self righteousness. The guy who pulls on the gentle sentimental heart strings of 12-15 year old kids who know no better and are just trying to find their somewhere to belong. 

He pulled this whole lame stunt in the name of a social experiment to show how woke he was and to get attention. Now it wasn’t all of the hypocrisy in his fking flawed viewpoint and actions that got to me, what really really ticks me off is people still agreeing with him and being ok with him doing this stupid fking stunt. Yeap these fan girls are fking lame but they’re fucking kids? Aren’t they just doing what kids are doing? What mob mentality is he talking about? 15 year olds rallying up to flame the guy who has been constantly poking fun at their god? Do 15 year olds run the fking world? Do 15 year olds have any fking real power to change anything in their current state? Has he enlightened anybody or imparted such wisdom that will always be in the back of people’s head? And he still has the audacity to tell the people he angered to not be angered by what a stranger says. That’s equivalent to me punching his fking gut and telling him to learn Muay Thai. 

Who the fuck is he to have the rights to manipulate teenagers emotions like this? Does he have merits in social sciences/mental health/psychology or children psychology? Does he have a top of the food chain IQ/EQ? Was he born a kid genius who finished his degree at 15 years old? Chibai this is the scientist people are ok with to ‘experiment’ on impressionable kids?

122,singapore,0,[An Open Letter to Maid Employers} To the woman who lives in the semi-D behind us:,6utfz7,button-holed,1503198014,74,358,"[An Open Letter to Maid Employers] To the woman who lives in the semi-D behind us:

The name that she gave you when you asked is a fake one. My domestic helper’s name is Elina, and she is the kindest, most mature and understanding person in my life. She wouldn’t have wanted me to write this, much less post it up on social media. She always says that things like this are her problems, not mine. I’m doing this anyway though, because I want to do something, and this seems like the best course of action, short of delivering this letter right to your doorstep.

I really don’t understand what you could have been thinking, when you confronted her when her employer's daughter was present, when my family’s freshly washed laundry is hanging between us, when you peer through the holes of your metal fence to scrape at her dignity. You said to her, “I’m having problems with my maids. They all talk to you, and they say that you have a high salary and that you go on holiday with your employer. I can see that you are good at what you do, but, please refrain from speaking to my maid any more. *Not everyone can be paid as much as you*.”

You don’t have to read someone’s mind to find their unsaid prejudices. These things slip out in the way we use our language, in our tone and in our expressions. You sounded arrogant and entitled, and your words betrayed an assumption that you have the right to speak to Elina any way you want. No, not just that right — you assumed that you can speak to her, deride her, and that she is obligated to *listen to you*. Domestic helpers are not citizens, but they are people. They are living, breathing human beings with rights and needs and desires. They deserve dignity, and no matter who you are you do not have the right to impose upon that. 

When you speak of your maid, do you really know who you’re talking about? When you look at her, do you see a person or a slave? Elina tells me that your domestic helpers haven’t stayed any longer than a few months — is it safe to assume, then, that you’ve seen the inside of a maid agency more than once? I’m talking about the ones that dot the dismal corridors of dingy malls, the ones that have posters of smiling young women next to their employers, undercut by the dead eyes of the actual women there. They sit, and sometimes do demonstrations with toy babies and never-used bedsheets, and wait for some Singaporean to pick them up to do the same in an actual house. They are taught to reply to every question with the words “Yes ma’am” or “Yes sir” even if they don’t want to — that really makes you wonder, doesn’t it, how many of these women have had their consent taken away from them, unable to voice the word “no” in a language they do not understand? 

Did you know that the minimum age for foreign domestic helpers in Singapore is twenty-three? They are taught to lie about it, the moment they arrive here. And your maids? They barely scrape twenty. I don’t suppose you actually know that, unless you’ve actually communicated with them and would rather ignore the fact that many are only in their teens?

These are girls and young women, sent away from their homes to live in this entitled metropolis. They are brown-skinned and doe-eyed, and know nothing about the world other than their hometowns. Can you really blame your maid, then, for talking to Elina? You confiscate her phone so she cannot call her family or her friends, or even a helpline if she wants to leave. You don’t let her have off-days, so she is confined to the house. You only give her bread and instant noodles and the leftovers from your own dinner, so she practically starves.

Then, you ask, what has Elina been doing? Elina is the one passing your maid food through the holes in the fence when you sleep. Elina is the one who helps her send money home, when she can’t leave the house. Elina is the one who offers her support, when she’s crying and can’t call home. 

Have you ever wondered why your maids don’t stay any longer than a few months?

Perhaps I’m being cowardly, by not telling you this to your face, or by posting this on the internet. But, well, you dismissed my presence entirely, when you confronted Elina. I can’t help but wonder: 
Do you do the same to your children? Have they grown up with your toxic words rebounding about the house? And when they grow up, will they speak like you, sneer like you, look down their noses at foreigners, *like you*?

I’m just another teen. But in another life I could’ve been born to a life of domestic slavery. Who you are and what you are worth isn’t dependent on your luck in the birth lottery. Your worth is decided by how you treat others, how kind you are, whether you are grateful for your lot in life. 

Please, refrain from speaking to Elina like that again. I don’t suppose you can understand, but she’s part of my family. 

Thanks for reading, and I hope you change.

hey um im getting lots of comments about how i really should stand for myself and how i dont have a spine &gt;.&lt; 
please understand that:
1. i wrote an open letter to raise awareness - that's what open letters are for. they arent about direct confrontation, and more of a literary piece of writing / opinion piece for an individual's feelings to be aired. so telling me that my neighbour will never read this is besides the point, sorry about that. 

2. i really dont know if i will take any action at this point, mostly because im a minor and if anything i should tell my parents to report this issue (not sure if they'll share my feelings on this either) so yeah i appreciate the calls for action but am presently unable to give you a valid response

one more thing: i believe very much in the importance of raising awareness and encouraging healthy discourse. i believe that there is a possibility for change in our society on a larger scale than one employer being reported. if enough people can take this up and talk about it and express their views and protect migrant workers in daily life, i think change can happen. so yes, ill talk to my parents, i'll try to make tangible change. but don't you see? flaming me for being a keyboard warrior impacts this situation even less than an open letter sent to no one. so sure, i may not be one for direct confrontation, but im doing my best, and i hope you understand",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/6utfz7/an_open_letter_to_maid_employers_to_the_woman_who/,0.0,"[""This ain't Craigslist or FB... but I get your point ""]"

125,singapore,0,In-Depth look at SCDF's fire and rescue side (part 2),4yislg,toothyfalcon,1471611856,1,49,"See the [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4xzjqa/indepth_look_at_scdfs_fire_and_rescue_side/) here! The first post is general information about SCDF, while this post is a FAQ for people who are interested in various aspects of SCDF. The main purpose of the FAQ is to address the concerns of any new recruits or (impending or new) station personnel.

This was originally combined with the original post, but I was already at the word limit, so I was unable to add new content. Discussions will be split, but I don't think this will be that big of an issue.

---

**FAQ – General Information**

&amp;gt;Are all 21 stations working 24 hours?

Yes. 

---

&amp;gt;Do the people on duty only sleep and wake up to go for calls?

No. This is the most widespread, erroneous and infuriating misconception that people have of us.
Yes, we do rest in our free time, but we do not have a lot of free time. Between all the admin work and training, realistically you’re only talking about 1-3 hours of free time.

---

&amp;gt;How do fire stations operate? In sections? In teams? How do you respond to a fire?

We all have our own sections that are permanent. However, we (or at least the way my station works) is that the vehicle we are attached to every duty will consist of different people. This crew will stick until the end of the duty.
When a major incident happens, multiple vehicles will turn out for the same incident. The crew tends to get jumbled up depending on manpower requirements. In such a situation we work more as an entire Rota (sans the people who aren’t involved in the incident, obviously), with little to no regard for the sections or the vehicle crew makeup.

---

&amp;gt;Are SCDF people all barbarians?

There is no politically correct way to answer this, so I’m just going to come out and say it.
Let us get this fact out of the way first: SCDF is a dumping ground for everyone they do not want in the other organizations that draft from the NSF pool. You will encounter people from all walks of life. Foreigners, people with criminal records, people with relatively low educational qualifications and true blue Singaporeans who, for some reason, are drafted into SCDF anyway.

Back to the question: Are people in SCDF barbaric? I will not give this a straight affirmative, because it implies everyone in SCDF is barbaric. However, I do have to point out that there seems to be a larger proportion of people here who are more… *Rugged*. *Rougher*. *Irreverent*.

(From this point onwards, let me establish the context as a discussion about only fire side personnel). But this is not necessarily a bad thing as it takes a certain type of person to succeed as fire side personnel. We need to get things done extremely quickly. With your facemask, flash hood and helmet on, you’re not going to hear anything. The only way to communicate quickly and accurately is to shout, and shout we do. During scenario drills, it is common to hear someone shouting, whether it is to get someone to do something, or to get someone out of the path of danger. 

People who have more barbaric mannerisms such as this are also not necessarily bad people. Many are fantastic workers, and are ultimately still human. They also have their softer sides. Conversely, you will find well-mannered people here (just like everywhere else) who can’t do anything, shit at maintaining relationships and can’t think of the big picture. 

This brings me to my last point in this question. SCDF is a great place to learn how to work with people very different from you. You learn how to manage different types of people and get them to warm up to you. That is the greatest lesson I have learned here.

---

&amp;gt; Is SCDF very regimental?

SCDF, at its core, is a paramilitary organization. It also has an entire rank structure. We have footdrills, marching and other nonsense happening here. Somebody that is of higher rank has higher authority than you. If you are a regular, NSFs are supposed to do what you tell them to.

But do we like it? Eh, not really. To many, SCDF is just a job or a place where they serve NS. Given a choice, we will gladly abolish the regimentation. However, regimentation ensures that we keep everyone in check. I have come across NSFs who will step over your head on the first day if you are too nice to them. 

To answer the question, yes, SCDF is regimental, but the regimentation is a necessary evil when you are dealing with such a pool of people (see “Are SCDF people all barbarians?”).

---

&amp;gt;Are there female firefighters?

Yes, and there are a surprising amount of them (although they are still relatively rare). They do not necessarily have lesser strength, and I have met some who are stronger than me. That was not a fun experience.
Just to be clear, I use masculine pronouns consistently to prevent clutter in the post. 

---

&amp;gt;Is SCDF training tough?

All NS training is tough. However, fire side training in SCDF is a different ball game from just cardio fitness. While the army has combat fitness, we have bunker fitness, which is a measure of how well you’re able to function with your bunker gear, BA set and facemask on:

* Are you able to think while extremely fatigued?

* Do you have the endurance to perform tasks (some using heavy equipment) with the additional ~20kg of load on you?
* Are you able to maneuver properly?

Fire side training acclimatizes your body to sweat a lot to dissipate the heat as fast as possible, as your bunker gear is essentially 2 to 3 jackets layered on each other. It frequently leaves our personnel extremely exhausted and sweaty, and heat strokes, while uncommon, are not unheard of. It will take your body a variable amount of time to acclimatize to be able to perform strenuous tasks with your bunker gear on without feeling like your body is burning up inside. It took me 6 to 9 months to not even feel any difference in heat.

There does not seem to be much correlation between cardio fitness and how well you will be able to build up your bunker fitness.

&amp;gt;Is working in SCDF very easy?

No. See the previous question.

If you’re referring to backend vocations, they are more or less the same as those of other organizations. 

If you’re referring to the EMS, also a no. They work 12 hour shifts, but they *really* work that 12 hours. Constant calls to the point of fatigue. It’s not as physically strenuous as firefighting or rescue, but you wouldn’t say a 42km over a few hours at a leisurely jogging pace is easier than a 400m sprint, right?

---

&amp;gt;Are there many Malays in SCDF? I have heard stories and I am concerned.

Yes. The same is true for SPF.

Race does not matter. If you are good at your work, you will be recognized and treated like a brother.

---

&amp;gt;Would you recommend people sign on to SCDF?

Honestly, no. The money is good for any given qualifications, but the amount of work and nonsense you have to put up with is ridiculous. 

Nobody ever stays in SCDF for the passion. People stay because they’re trapped by circumstances. Many sign on for passion, but the fire is quickly dowsed by buckets after buckets of water as you realize that things aren’t what they seem to be from outside.

I also don’t think signing on for the money is really that worth it, especially for non-Diploma holders. I only think it at least breaks even if you’re on some form of scholarship or sponsorship.

Having said that, depending on your secondary appointments, you can do some truly meaningful work. Other than your primary appointment of saving lives and property, you can also ensure safety through enforcing fire safety, community engagements, etc. You get to see that there are people who come for station visits every Saturday who are genuinely interested in what SCDF is all about.

The job is also very stable, and your bonuses and increments are guaranteed. If you’re willing to go all-out for money, then who am I to stop you?

---

&amp;gt;If I sign on, what benefits do I get?

Other than the obvious monetary incentives, you will be sponsored a Class 3 and 4 license (if you do not have them yet). You will also be granted a vocational license allowing you to drive emergency vehicles. Class 2B, 2A and 2 licenses are also sponsored, but they have a waitlist and not everybody can get them (unlike the Class 3 and 4, which are guaranteed). I have been cautioned by some of the colleagues more in the know that going too deep with the Class 2 licenses may end up with you being posted to be a Firebiker. I cannot confirm whether this is true or not.

&amp;gt;What are the different PPEs in SCDF?

* [Bunker gear](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Auxg0pDCMAE2JZ2.jpg) for everyone

* [CA Suit](http://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/articles/2014/08/04/suit.jpg) for everyone

* [High Performance Suit]( http://news.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/515x370/public/original_images/Aug2014/SCDFsuitup6.jpg?itok=LUHLX2jK) for the Hazmat specialists

DART specialists work with the normal long 4 uniform.

---

&amp;gt;Is working/serving NS in SCDF fulfilling?

I hesitate to use the word “fulfilling”, but you can be sure we serve the public in more ways than they know. We go for many nonsense calls, and we, along with our SPF colleagues, are the first line of civil defense.

---

&amp;gt;Do SCDF people hate SPF?

Another one of those difficult questions. I should stop asking these questions to myself.

While SCDF personnel frequently mock SPF for their inaction during calls, I realized while answering the previous question that this is not justified at all (and hence split this into a separate question). Firstly, whenever we attend calls with SPF, unless it is a suicide incident, we are the incident managers. In essence, what it means is that we have the authority to make calls for most decisions. Correspondingly, these calls are calls that only SCDF people can do something about. Locked doors, fires, rescues, etc. The police do not have any way of helping us.
On the other hand, SPF personnel attend to their own calls that we do not see, and they have other ridiculous bullshit that they have to deal with.

I was once on call with a crew of NPCO personnel. We were waiting for the security guard of a premises to open the door for us, I asked her what life was like (having been so close to being in SPF instead of SCDF). The short answer is that you are almost guaranteed never to be able to leave on time, between the reports and having to surrender their guns.

So, to answer the question, no, SCDF personnel do not hate SPF, but there is animosity by SCDF people towards SPF, and often it is unjustified. 

Am I guilty of it? Until a minute ago, yes. 

Do all SCDF people hate SPF? No.

---

&amp;gt;What role do reservists/ORNSmen play in responding to incidents?

None whatsoever.

No, really. The higher management wants to believe that they are playing an active role, and have been actively trying to integrate them into station response, but the brutal truth is that it will take many more years before they can even think about cultivating a suitable culture for this.

Besides, as long as there are people who think derogatorily of NS, even in some aspects (read: there will always be such people, including yours truly), these NSmen will not cooperate. They are all here because they are bound by the law.

**FAQ – Training Matters**

&amp;gt;I didn’t choose to be in SCDF. What should I know about SCDF?

You will start your training in the National Service Training Institute (NSTI) either in PTP or BRT, depending on whether you have gotten silver for your NAPFA. Once you complete the entire BRT phase, you will be posted to different vocations.

---

&amp;gt;What vocations are available to NSFs in SCDF?

* Provost

* Driver

* Storeman

* Clerk (which branches out into many other designations, depending on your department)

* Firefighter

* Section Commander

* NSTI Instructor

* CDA Instructor

* K9

---

&amp;gt;What is X vocation like?

Unfortunately, I do not have experience in many of them (and that is also the reason why the focus of this post slants heavily towards the firefighting and rescue aspect of SCDF). I do not wish to perpetuate any rumours of the different vocations that I have heard, as there is no way for me to affirm their veracity. Perhaps this will attract enough people from SCDF that you will be able to ask for advice on other vocations.

---

&amp;gt;I don’t want to go to station. Can I choose to be an instructor instead?

Yes, and while I think station life has been a blast, I will not encourage or discourage this decision. I spent my entire 6 months dreading station life. Ultimately, whether you are granted your wish is up to the recommendation of your instructors and DRC in CDA.

---

&amp;gt;Is what I heard about Yishun true?

Yes, but things have changed. I am not in Yishun, but management relevant to their personnel has changed. Their division commander, CFS, RC and DRC are all different now. Remnants of the culture will inevitably still bleed into current times, but it is my opinion that they are not the hellhole that they used to be (or people used to make them out to be).

[Someone from Yishun want to confirm this?]

---

&amp;gt;What are my chances of being selected for fire side training?

If you’re PES A or B, you’re almost guaranteed to be selected.

---

&amp;gt;Is FFC, SCC and RCC stay-in?

Yes.

---

**FAQ – Station Matters**

&amp;gt;How did you adjust to the 24/48 hour shift?

First of all, you will be resting on your 24 hours duty. NSFs will have it a bit worse because you need to man the sentry. Most likely you will be given ungodly hours to man when you're still new, like ~3am. 

Regardless, you have your 2 off days to rest. You usually only need to nap on your first off. I usually nap about 3 hours, which should be sufficient. The trick is to make sure you get ample rest on your duty. Free time after night lecture? Sleep early. Don't engage in activities like playing games, playing with your phone, etc. 

&amp;gt;What is station routine like?

Officially, duty is from 8am to 8am. However, you will fall in before 8am, and you will leave station earliest by 9am the next day as you need to hand over your equipment to the incoming Rota. The official routine as provided by the ops department can be found below. We follow it quite closely.

* 0745hrs: Fall in

* 0800hrs to 0900hrs: Equipment check

* 0900hrs to 1000hrs: Equipment drill

* 1000hrs to 1345hrs: Operational routine

* 1345hrs: Fall in

* 1345hrs to 1700hrs: Operational routine

*1700hrs to 1900hrs: Physical training

*2000hrs to 2100hrs: Night lecture

*2100hrs to 0545hrs: Free time

*0545hrs: Fall in

*0600hrs to 0700hrs: Chemical Agent Acclimatization Drill (doing training in CA suit)

*0700hrs to 0800hrs: BTM or baris

The only time you are ever allowed to deviate from the routine *slightly* is when it is a weekend (and sometimes not even then, and rightly so), or if it is a public holiday.

---

&amp;gt;I am afraid of my safety when I become a frontliner. What should I do?

You will never turn out for an incident alone. If you are ever in a situation where you are in danger or could be placed in danger (ceiling collapsing, explosions etc), you can be assured that there will be *a lot* of people on scene. The combined number of years of experience in such a situation is likely more than a hundred years. In such incidents, there will also likely be higher management commanding the situation. If you are an RC, you will have many regulars beside you who can provide guidance if you’re unsure, and support you if you make a decision.
In Singapore, frontliners like us also face fairly limited danger. We do not have huge forests that could get engulfed and surround you on all sides, and fires are actually not very common.

The construction of buildings, as well as the storage, transport and use of toxic chemicals and flammable materials are highly regulated. 

Lastly, the training protocols on SCDF have a very large focus on maintaining the safety of our own personnel. In complex operations like height rescue, we introduce many levels of redundancies to ensure that if one mechanism fails, there are backups in place. We are *never* encouraged to risk our lives to save other people. Save yourself, so you can worry about saving others.

---

&amp;gt;How do I survive in station?

First of all, all regulars are expected to be good in operations and admin work.

If you are an RC, most of the shots fired at you will likely be other RCs or your CFS. Learn to read them and manage your time properly. Otherwise, you risk being overwhelmed by all the admin work. You will be there until you ORD or get your next posting, which is about 1 to 2 years later. It is not a very short time, so it is important to manage inter-rota relations. Don’t even think about not participating in the baris in your first few months. This is how you train up for operations. If you do not have the knowledge, and show that you are not eager to learn, *nobody* will follow your instructions. There goes your control over the Rota.

For regulars in general, the point about being expected to be good at operations is important to take note. While the NSFs can get away with meandering through, you need to be familiar with the SOPs and doctrines for different types of incidents. This is even more so if you are a section commander, because unlike the RC who will be commanding the situation, you will actually be the one overseeing the operations in close quarters. You will also sometimes be designated as the ground commander for baris. Any shortcomings in your knowledge or familiarity with the SOPs and doctrines will be extremely obvious.

The below should apply for everyone.

SCDF is not school, and it's not all flowers and happiness. It is a workplace. While it may be an unconventional environment to work in, the people here are the same. How you survive here is how you survive outside (don't be stupid, don't have more patterns than badminton, etc.), with some caveats. 

Some people may be able to survive outside by acting all tough, etc. That won't work here. You will be vulnerable in station, and people will capitalize on that if you try to act like that side of you doesn't exist. In fact, people like this will always be targeted first, and some people actually take sadistic pleasure in ensuring they break your soul (can you blame them?).

Be nice and humble, but be firm and not be a pushover. Respect your seniors and regulars. Stay humble, learn as much as you can as fast as you can, be fit (or at least show that you're trying to be fit), and be accountable and responsible.

I think this is true for all NS organizations, but I've seen a growing trend where the NSFs coming in do not know how to maintain relationships, read situations, etc. This isn't a problem specific to SCDF, but I figure I will address it here since it is still relevant. I'm not some super guru with great relationships with everyone and able to win over all my enemies, but the above should be useful.

&amp;gt;I am a new personnel and I feel I am always simply following instructions. How do I become better at operations?

I disclaim this Q&amp;amp;A by saying I’m not *fantastic* with operations, but I generally know enough to get by and make sure things go smoothly.

You do not need to be someone who is the best at operations and able to bring out 5 dummies alone in a baris, but it is important that you be proficient in all the equipment, and know when to use them. Quick thinking is also important, but this may not be natural for everyone. It will, however, come in time. 

I have narrowed down 5 aspects that I think contributes to success at operations:

* Presence of mind while under pressure and when fatigued

* Strength

* Endurance

* Technique and knowledge

* Command, leadership and spatial visualization

Presence of mind refers to one’s ability to keep calm and make decisions. It is important because you will be expected to make decisions. For RCs, you will be commanding your entire Rota to achieve an overall objective (mitigate the CA? Put out the fire? Rescue the trapped casualty?). Even if you are a section commander receiving instructions from your RC over the matra, you may still need to make decisions. How do you want this particular door to be cut? Will a bolt cutter suffice for this lock? Do you want to delegate one of your crew members to a separate task? What task needs to be done that the RC has not tasked someone to do yet?

Strength should be self-explanatory. Many equipment in SCDF are heavy. Our lifepack, for example, weighs more than 100kg and requires multiple personnel to deploy properly. You need to be able to extricate an unconscious casualty, who may weigh up to 90kg or more. On the lower end of the spectrum, you will be expected to carry one medium-sized hose and one other equipment while you’re in full gear. That comes out to around 30kg to 40kg. Certain stations may expect more from you. 

Having said that, strength is not the be all, end all. It is good to have, but without the other factors, your strength will not come out to be of much use. 

Endurance is the most important factor of them all. SCDF operations aren’t as prolonged as the army’s (which may last days or weeks), but due to the fast and furious nature of SCDF frontlines, personnel get tired out very easily. Endurance will make sure you can continue functioning 45 minutes into the operation.

Technique and knowledge are also important. Without our equipment, we are useless. Knowing when to use and how to use the equipment will make a big difference.

Command and leadership is important. Most people will be able to take charge when asked to, but everybody does it to different levels of effectiveness, which is determined by your decisiveness, familiarity with the incident (which we achieve through continual training) and your visualization skills. Visualization is important because it allows you to keep in view what each section is doing and their exact locations. Every baris or large-scale operation will have a staging point, which serves as the heart of the operations. Ask them for information, because it is with these information that you can make the appropriate decisions.

Every factor interacts with each other, so it is difficult for me to segregate everything out. Hopefully with the above wall of text, I have presented the concept clearly enough for it to be of use. If it didn’t, I summarize it with this sentence: training and practice helps.

For NSFs, just be proficient in your equipment, be sharp with your technique, and listen to your seniors, regulars and RC.

---

&amp;gt;What type of admin work is there?

* Logistics

* Manpower (including management of regular leaves)

* NSF management (including management of NSF leaves)

* Enforcement (scheduling fire safety checks and processing the cases)

* HRI planning

* Operational survey (conducting of surveys at companies for familiarization of premises, and updating records)

* Hydrant testing (performing hydrant tests and updating the system)

* Community engagement

* Projects

&amp;gt;Is it advisable to take part-time studies while working on a 24-48 shift?

I initially hesitated on tackling this question, but since this is a very unique set of circumstances, I thought I’d try to address this.

I don’t have any advice on how to manage your time, because I intend to study full-time after my bond, so this will just be a very short factual paragraph.

If you do decide to take it on, and your classes fall on your duty day, you can take time off for it. SCDF is very supportive of continual education. You can also study while on duty (but obviously it will be disruptive).

---

&amp;gt;Is the Rota shift tiring?

It is chicken feet compared to the SPF NPCO and EMS shift. Unless you get a call in the middle of the night, you should be able to get at least 4-6 hours of rest. NSFs have it worse because they have to man the sentry. If you get lesser than that, you have your first off day to get some more rest in.

I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to get used to the 24 hours, but it’s really very similar to other jobs, except you just spend your night in a fire station. The two days off are also good because it’s uninterrupted downtime. 

---

&amp;gt;Do you have to work on your off days?

Sometimes, yes. You get sent to attend some stupid event where it is very obvious you’re there just to bolster the numbers. Other times it’s a 2 day course on both your off days, so you get no rest at all. This is what I hate by far **the most**. I can do whatever you want on my duty, just don’t ask me to attend events that I don’t care about. 
If you have a lot of admin work to catch up, you do it on your off days too.

---

&amp;gt;I would like to be a firefighter but I wear spectacles. Can I still proceed?

Yes. The Force will issue you goggles with degree lenses that will allow you to wear your facemask over it.

---

&amp;gt;Is there ragging in SCDF?

No.

Ragging as it is traditionally understood does not exist anymore (and if it does, the people doing it are taking an extremely big risk, and also doing a good job at hiding it). SCDF takes an extremely firm stance on the matter, and anybody found taking part in ragging will be sent to DB, be given a warning letter (an extremely huge deal, as it is considered a formal disciplinary action and will affect your performance grading and other monetary incentives), or directly forced to resign.

There may be playful nudging here and there for the newer guys, and some people may be more stern to them to keep them in place and to make sure they learn what they need to quickly (see “How do I survive in station?""). They may be expected to do repeated fatiguing activities, like BTMs, but this is all in the name of learning and practice. I encountered the same thing and I didn’t like it, but this remains a very good way to identify big-headed and/or undertrained personnel. 

---

&amp;gt;What will be my career progression like?

Non-diploma holders start as CPL+ but wear the SGT rank. The official records show that they are CPL. Their first promotion will be to full SGT. Their pay will be slightly lesser than full SGTs. Diploma holders start as full SGT. 

Degree holders start out as either LTA or CPT, depending on their academic achievements and whether they are considered to have the aptitude to start their career as a CPT. It is to my knowledge that first-class honours graduates are no longer automatically conferred the CPT rank.

Regulars who sign on before NS (henceforth referred to as pre-enlistees) will be bonded for 5 years (see “MTE”).  Their starting rank will follow the rules as set out in the previous paragraph. Their first promotion will usually (but not always, as in cases where the regular is extremely good at his job) be delayed by 1 or 2 years compared to regulars who have served NS. 

Your primary appointment of firefighting and rescue actually has little bearing on your promotions (although specialist tracks, especially DART, do help). Most of the recognition will be due to high-level project, especially those with a large amount of tangible, trackable benefits with little to no drawbacks. 

3-5 years in service, you can opt to specialize into an aspect: Hazmat, DART, Firebiker, EMT or Marine. Hazmat in particular is a very useful and sought-after specialist certification if you ever wish to leave the force. You are also forced to specialize sometimes. It is also not unheard of to be able to specialize before 3 years of service.
Depending on vacancies, you may be posted to the specialist unit, or you may return back to your fire station to wait for a vacancy. The time you have to wait is variable.

Further postings after that also depend on many variables. One thing to note is that at any time if you are injured beyond frontline operational capabilities, you may be posted to the backend as admin staff instead.
Personnel who are generally getting on in age also tend to be posted towards the backend, especially if they have also expressed a preference for such postings.

&amp;gt;I am an active section commander. How do I be better at comms?

If you seize up when using the comms, you just need to practice more. 

If you’re not sure what information needs to be relayed and what doesn’t, observe what other section commanders do.

Your informative message must be given within 1-2 minutes upon arrival. I originally wanted to list down what information is required, but there are too many types of situations and variables to take into account. As a general rule of thumb, your informative message should contain what you would want to know if you’re a blind rescuer except information that allows you to move around. In other words, you will want to report the following:

* Your location

* Any casualties found

* What equipment is being used

* Nature of fire (what type of fire? How big is the fire? Are there any chemicals? Is it contained?)

* Nature of rescue (Is somebody trapped? Is the situation stable? Is SCDF stabilizing the incident?)

While the incident is ongoing, the frequency of comms is determined by whether it is an actual operation or just a baris. If it is a baris, report whatever you’re doing so that they can update you and so the ground commander knows your location. Baris tend to be more complex with more injections, so comms is more important than usual.
If it is a real operation, just improvise and play by ear. With experience, you will know what is relevant and what isn’t.

Don’t be too hung up on the proper format for comms. As long as it doesn’t sound too casual, you will be good. Be familiar with common NATO phonetic alphabets. Last thing you want to do is use it, then blank out as you forget the word for the letter “N”.

This post is an in-depth look at the firefighting and rescue side of SCDF. It is inspired by the lack of firefighting-centric drama based in Singapore (with the exception of the DART-focused drama “Mooncake” that received so little marketing I didn’t even know it existed until I drafted this post), and also by the surprising lack of knowledge that the public has on the capabilities and job scope of firefighting and rescue personnel in SCDF. The entire post will be looking at it mostly from the perspectives of a fire side personnel.

Part 1 (here) will present information about SCDF, while [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4yislg/indepth_look_at_scdfs_fire_and_rescue_side_part_2/) will be the FAQ.

I don’t pretend this is a fantastic Holy Grail for making decisions, nor do I pretend everything here is 100% accurate. In fact, I have done some filtering to make sure no one gets into any form of trouble.

Inside, you will find general information on SCDF. For impending recruits, those who intend to sign on, or members of public interested in the inner workings of SCDF, in-depth information on select different departments in SCDF and training are also available. 

A part of the post will be formatted as an FAQ. Hopefully this will give better context to the information. 

I must disclaim that this is **not** sanctioned by our Public Affairs Department, and I should not expect it will ever be, as it touches on some, well, touchy topics. My views *do not* represent the views of the Public Affairs Department, my fellow colleagues, the NSFs working under me, my direct superiors and higher management, or the Singapore Civil Defence Force itself. Obviously, I am posting this on a throwaway account to make sure I cannot be identified. 

Before I go on, I must explain that despite the Force’s shortcomings, I am proud to be in SCDF, and I truly have faith in SCDF to be able to handle the incidents that we are trained for. 

The first section will be a glossary of words and phrases that SCDF uses. This is non-exhaustive, and certain terms (such as FSM) are intentionally left out as they may not be immediately relevant to the people who would find this post useful.

**Glossary**

* Appliance: SCDF term for vehicles.

* ASCC: Advance Section Commander Course. 10 day course that trains Section Commanders in more complex incidents (like escalator rescue). Following the course, personnel will be conferred the title “Section Commander I”.

* BA: Breathing apparatus. Usually refers to the entire BA cylinder mounted on a backplate that allows you to wear it like a backpack. Weighs 12.7kg and, on paper, allows personnel to breathe for 30 to 45 minutes.

* Baris: Commonly used to refer to scenario drills.

* BRT: Basic Rescue Training. The equivalent of BMT for SAF. It is a 10-week stay-in course where recruits learn basic rescue techniques, and how to operate basic rescue equipment.

* BTF: Basic Task Force. The initial fleet of vehicles responding to an incident.

* BTM: Basic Task Manuals. These are fundamental tasks which are timed that a section has to complete. These range from pitching a ladder, setting up two firefighting jets, etc.

* CA: Chemical agents. Frequently associated with terrorist attacks in SCDF context.

* Callsigns: The shorthand names for every vehicle in the frontlines. See below for explanation.

* CBRE: Collective term referring to the following substances: Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives. 

* CDA: Civil Defence Academy. It is located beside NSTI, and is considered a separate entity from it. It provides specifically firefighting and rescue training for those selected to cross over to the fire side.

* Commander Fire Station (CFS): The equivalent of a Commanding Officer in SAF. CsFS work on office hours in the 21 fire stations in Singapore, but are standby 24/7 for any major incidents. In essence, they can be called up at any time (even in the middle of the night) for as long as they hold the position of CFS (usually around 2 years). Some people use the term OC instead, which was the term used before “CFS” was used.

* CPL: Combined Platform Ladder. One of the most common vehicles behind PLs and LFs. It consists of a 30m ladder mounted on a boom, which is on the back of the vehicle. It can reach up to 10 storeys vertically, but for operations considerations we limit it to 8 storeys.

* DART: Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team. They are the commando-equivalent in SCDF and specialize away from firefighting into different types of rescue (although they are also well-versed in firefighting), such as USAR, confined space rescue and height rescue. These are the people rappelling down from the roof when there is a suicide incident. Attaining a DART specialist tag is the highest prestige in SCDF.

* Division: A shortened version of the phrase “divisional headquarters”. SCDF is split into four divisions, each headed by a station (see section “Basic Information of SCDF”). Division refers to these four fire stations.

* Deputy Rota Commander (DRC): A junior officer who has risen up the ranks enough to be at least a WO2, and appointed to be a DRC. He is the encik in the Rota. The overwhelming majority of the time, the DRC will have at least 10 years of service under his belt before being appointed to be a DRC. He is the real boss behind a Rota, unless he chooses to relinquish his command to the RC (who is more often than not a new officer who has just posted out from training and has very little experience and commanding prowess). 

* DO: Duty Officer. Versatile term used to describe different things. It can refer to the RC on duty, the ground commander of a scenario drill. When used as part of the phrase “DO pump”, it refers to the fire engine that the RC is manning while on duty.

* EAS: Emergency Ambulance Services. This term is deprecated and has been replaced by the term “EMS”.

* EMS: Emergency Medical Services

* ERS: Emergency Response Specialist. Term is used interchangeable with Section Commanders, but usually only referring to regulars.

* ETF: Enhanced Task Force. The secondary fleet of vehicles responding after the BTF if reinforcements are required and/or the incident is confirmed.

* EV4A: The emergency vehicle license granted that allows you to drive ambulances.

* EV4F: The emergency vehicle license granted that allows you to drive vehicles with firefighting capabilities (i.e PLs and LFs).

* FI: Fire Investigation. Refers to the entire process of investigating the cause of a fire. Fire reports will have to be put up for all fires categorized higher than the C2 category (see below for explanation). 

* Fire side: Refers to all personnel in the firefighting and rescue part of SCDF.

* FFC: Firefighter Course. 3-month course where recruits train to be Firefighters. Firefighters can hold the rank of PTE, LCP or CPL.

* FRS: Fire Rescue Specialist. This is a legacy term that has been deprecated and replaced by “ERS”.

* HQ: Refers to SCDF headquarters, located at Ubi. It is co-located with Paya Lebar Fire Station and DART base (see “DART”).

* HRI: High risk installation. Every station’s boundary will have multiple HRIs (central having the most if I am not mistaken). There are different categories of HRIs, such as due to housing occupants with limited mobility, storage of chemicals, high occupancy load, etc.

* HTTC: Home Team Tactical Centre. There are advanced simulators there to provide realistic training for personnel. HTTC is located near the soon-to-be-demolished MTV.

* Injects: Ad-hoc changes made to a scenario drill while it is ongoing to make it more difficult. Common ones are water supply down, SCDF personnel down, etc. 

* LF or LFAV: Light Fire Attack Vehicle. Refers to the red rhinos.

* Matra: Refers to the comms set that all frontliners (fire side and EMS) use for communications with Ops Center and with each other.

* MTE: Minimum Term of Engagement. Regulars who sign on with SCDF prior to completing their national service (with any organization) will have to fulfil a 5-year bond, known as the MTE. 

* MTV: Mandai Training Village. A small village located along Mandai Road where training for pump operation, CPL and emergency vehicle licenses are conducted.

* NCO: Non-commissioned officer. Versatile term used to describe different things. It can refer to the DRC on duty, and when used as part of the phrase “NCO pump”, it refers to the fire engine (which is treated as the secondary fire engine going out for less important calls) that the DRC or a regular is commanding while on duty. 

* NSTI: National Service Training Institute. It is located beside CDA, and is considered a separate entity from it. It provides basic training such as foot drills and basic rescue techniques for new recruits.

* PA: Private Ambulance. SCDF has arrangements with private ambulance companies for them to provide their services.

* PAO: Private Ambulance Operators. Refers to private ambulance personnel. They do not hold ranks, and while generally bound by most sweeping rules (no smoking, etc), they are mostly accountable to their companies, not to SCDF.

* PL or pumper or pump: Refers to Pump Ladder, the classic, big fire engines.

* RCC: Rota Commander Course. It is a 9-month (heard it has been shortened; can anyone confirm the actual duration now?) course. The course includes training on fitness, firefighting, rescue, hazmat and relevant knowledge in these areas. Personnel will be conferred the title “Rota Commander”.

* Rota: The equivalent of a platoon in SCDF. Fire stations are manned 24/7 by 3 Rotas, which works out to a 24-48 shift (work one day, off two days). 

* Rota Commander (RC): These are the senior officers attached to a Rota, and will oversee its operations every duty. They report directly to the Commander Fire Station.

* SCC: Section Commander Course. 6-month course (apparently duration has been shortened marginally; can anyone confirm the actual duration now?) training recruits and regulars to become Section Commanders. The course includes training on fitness, firefighting, rescue, hazmat and relevant knowledge in these areas. Personnel will be conferred the title “Section Commander II”.

* Turn out: The SCDF version of the word “dispatch” or vehicle (see “Appliance”). This can be used as a verb, to refer to responding to a call, or as a noun, to refer to a particular incident or a vehicle.

* USAR: Urban Search and Rescue.

**Basic Information of SCDF**

SCDF provides firefighting, rescue and hazardous materials (henceforth referred to as hazmat) management capabilities at its heart. Frontliners turn out for the following calls:

* Rubbish chute fires
* Central divider fires on expressways or roads
* Vegetation fires
* Unit fires in residential areas
* Chemical fires
* Factory and warehouse fires
* Suicide calls
* Calls involving entrapment (e.g locked doors, person trapped in small places, etc)
* Calls involving toxic industrial chemicals requiring investigation or mitigation
* Calls involving release of chemical agents requiring investigation mitigation

SCDF also turns out for other miscellaneous, not-as-urgent calls:

* Body retrieval
* Oil/cement/blood/concrete spillage cleanup
* Investigation of fire alarm systems (which may or may not lead to the discovery of an actual fire; majority of the time it’s a false alarm)
*  Unexploded bombs

**The Four Divisions**

The four SCDF divisions comprise of 21 fire stations. 1st Division covers the western and central areas, 2nd Division covers the eastern areas, 3rd Division covers the northern areas, while 4th division covers the western and north-western areas. Division headquarters are in bold. Fire stations with hazmat capabilities are marked with a “(H)”.

1st Division:

* 11: Central

* **12: Alexandra**

* 13: Clementi

* 14: Jurong Island (H)

* 15: Bishan

* 16: Banyan (H)

* 17: Marina Bay

* 18: Sentosa

2nd Division:

* 21: Paya Lebar

* **22: Tampines (H)** 

* 23: Changi

3rd Division:

* **31: Yishun**

* 32: Ang Mo Kio

* 33: Seng Kang

4th Division:

* 41: Jurong

* 42: Tuas (H)

* 43: Woodlands

* **44: Bukit Batok**

* 45: Tuas View (H)

Marine Command:

* 81: West Coast

* 82: Brani

Other than that, we also have other active units that are not directly under the jurisdiction of the four divisions.

* CDA: 51

* NSTI: 61

* DART: 91

* HQ: 99

**Categories of Fire**

* A (3 or more people injured or involvement of death)

* B (lesser than 3 people injured)

* C1 (damage to property of at least $50)

* C2 (damage to property of less than $50)

These are then further categorized into accidental or incendiary causes. All accidental fires of category C1 and above require a report, as do all incendiary fires.

**Callsigns**

The easiest way to understand callsigns is to use examples. 

PL421: PL refers to the vehicle, which is a pump ladder. The numbers 421 means that it is the first pump ladder from station 42, which is Tuas Fire Station.

PL182: Again, PL refers to the vehicle being a pump ladder. The numbers 182 means that it is the second pump ladder from station 18, which is Sentosa Fire Station.

LF211: LF refers to the vehicle, which is a red rhino. The numbers 211 means that it is the first rhino from station 21, which is Paya Lebar Fire Station.

**Light Fire Attack Vehicle**

Our LFAVs, known to the public colloquially as red rhinos, are unique to Singapore. 

Fire engines (SCDF equivalent: pump ladder) around the world have their own water tank. SCDF pump ladders hold 1.6k litres of water. This ensures that we can always set up our firefighting jets (which is more dependent on personnel skill, technique and fitness) without being held back by having to set up your water supply first (which is more dependent on your location and general uluness of the place).

LFAVs do not have any water tanks. Older generations of LFAVs have a 50/55 litre water tank for our water mist gun. It has since been replaced by the CAF backpacks in the LF 4G and LF 5G (and therefore the newer vehicles do not have a water tank at all). All operations requiring more than just the water mist gun will require the tapping of a hydrant for water supply.

The reason why we are able to do this is due to our extensive network of hydrants. The general guideline is that there should be one hydrant within a 50m radius, although this is not always the case.

0,NationalServiceSG,6256,Anxiety? Depression? Help.,kkha11,chaorecroot,1608982595,11,1," wall of text inbound. 

Before I entered the army I guess I’ve been kinda happy… I have many hobbies (photography, sim racing, cycling, etc) with barely any issues, though I am relatively introverted. I enlisted in around August (PTP batch) and integrated pretty well (I was enjoying waking up early and actually doing PT and stuff).

Sometime later, around the first week of BMT, I started getting anxiety issues. Nausea, light headedness and stuff that stays for the duration of the day, and sometimes even a day or two. OC said something about “sinking feeling every book in”, and I assumed it was that. A few weeks later, it started getting bad. I was breaking down, having anxiety attacks almost every weekend, and I hated it even more. I started to loathe notifications and alarms (I completely turn off everything when I get home on the weekend), and any message notifications get me super anxious and depressed (even though it may be someone else’s phone). I chalked it up to burnout, which I guess happens when an introvert is forced into communal living. Around my field camp week (1st week of November), things started going real bad real fast, and I started getting more and more anxiety attacks on the weekends, and started having constant headaches and backaches (that exist to this day). 

I RSO-ed for ARI for 3 days (for a bad cough and runny nose), and spent a day in camp the entire week. I didn’t feel any better mentally, and my headache was still there. When I booked back in the following week, I had to sit out of the 24K route march because of headache and back pain. I started getting moodier, pissed off at people, and around this time I also started getting more and more pissed at myself. My bunk mates would torment me and constantly call me chao-keng for having a headache, and wouldn’t help me with tasks because they “don’t talk to chao keng”. It got bad to the point that I carried my SOG with me as a reminder of what not to do.

Then came block leave, which was honestly even more miserable. I was constantly anxious about not meeting my schedules (I had lunch with a few close friends, and went on a photography trip), but I had to work around not having an alarm clock (hate alarms). I got anxious that I would be posted to command school and have to deal with more pressure and more toxic behaviour from people. When the posting finally came out, I was slightly relieved that i didn’t manage to get to command school, but I was also really depressed because I had been posted back to my mono unit. I decided to tahan until I reported into camp to report sick, and I reported sick for my backache and headache, and lo and behold I was given 2 days LD and painkillers (that hadn’t worked for any of the pain so far). I finished the course of the painkillers and there was no change. 

I constantly questioned myself whether something was truly wrong with me; why everyone was against me 24/7 and I couldn’t do anything about it. I informed my PC and Sec Comm about my anxiety issues and they chalked it up to adjustment disorder, and told me I have no choice but to suck it up and tahan the 2 years. Fast forward 1 week, and I had 3 anxiety attacks in 1 day, and had breathing difficulties and chest pain for the day. I asked permission to RSO, and they denied, asking me to report sick in camp. I dragged myself to camp, told myself I would have one night of rest before I can finally see the MO. The next day, I reported sick, and the sec comm told me I would go in the afternoon to see the MO. Sometime through the day, OC came to talk to me and told me that I was just having adjustment issues and that I seemed fine in training day to day, and told me he wasn’t going to let me see the MO. 

I do acknowledge that I have self esteem issues and struggle to fit in at times, but surely breaking down every weekend for 2 months, losing sleep over the weekend and choosing to stay at home is more than just adjustment issues. I find it hard to relax over the weekend because I’m constantly worried about overshooting the timing. I barely have sleep because I wake up every 15 minutes and dread the alarm clock. I’ve been trying to suck it up, telling myself that other people have it worse, but it makes me feel worse that I’m feeling bad about such  “trivial” matters.

It feels to me like living day to day for other people has become the new norm, and the only time that I’m alone is when its late at night. On the weekends I have to visit my grandparents, go out to buy things for camp.

Day to day life in camp has even been more depressing. I want to rest but I have to wash clothes. Showers take twice as long because I have to mentally prepare myself for the cold water. I wake up 1.5 hours before reveille so that I can ensure I wash up before the day. I barely have time to eat at meals, and I have to battle constant headaches and  backaches. 

I honestly don’t know what to do right now, I’m at the end of the line and have run out of ideas. RSO-ing without permission could land  me with an insubordination charge, but waiting for the chain of command/MO may delay so long that I fear I may end up being suicidal in a week or two. I honestly don’t have any motivations anymore as my long term goals have been derailed. The current phase of training will last until July 2021, and it’s basically BMT on steroids, and I’m seriously already burnt out. I’m missing important family activities, and now even holidays are being planned without me. Is it even worth pushing forward for another 2 years, yielding for yet another white lie? Bookouts are a pain, and I don’t even have the time to relax or do my hobbies anymore.

The thing that is holding me back from gg to sign on is the following:
- abit above avg A level results, and can't really fight all the scholars
- physically not that fit(maybe just lazy) , never got gold in 2nd year(only can use Eliss)
- cadet (ocs) performance actually not that great....
- feel like the culture in SAF might be good in some units but toxic in other units, hence the fear of ending up under bad superiors and hating my shit life without being able to move around. 
-the pay I can fetch in any civil service is probably gonna be significantly lesser than the private sector given the above as well....

But now I really just miss putting on my boots, ilbv and field pack and gg for a walk. And I also miss the camaraderie that I had with some of my commanders and other peers

TBH as I'm typing this I'm also realizing the amount of stress injury/aches/pains that I used to have isn't there anymore and is probably the reason I'm thinking abt gg back? Maybe if I'm physically feeling all the bullshit my body has to go through again then I won't wanna do it as much anymore?

Another thing I'm considering is to sign on spf... Or maybe become an OBS instructor?

5,NationalServiceSG,5276,I’m having a horrible and tough time for many months now and I can’t take it,jhot37,throwaway9273893289,1603607266,12,1,"Let me start off by saying that I have been visiting IMH for my conditions for many months as asked by camp MO during BMT. I’m a clerk and will not be revealing any details regarding which camp I’m going to or any other specific details. 

I have been facing numerous problems in camp of extreme discrimination over the months and have been trying to mitigate them one by one through asking the higher ups or my parent intervening and requesting the higher ups to solve the issues. 

Higher ups have always emphasised me visiting IMH in front of many people to embarrass me and make me look an idiot. It felt awful for many months and was reported to the OC recently. 

Recently, unit members and the leading superior of my unit just suddenly went against me by creating new rules as time goes on. I have been stationed in a small office beside the main one to always help out my sub superior with many things and I did them diligently and no one has ever said anything about my quality of work. 

What happened was that was that apparently someone in my unit reported me for not doing anything and was asked by my superior what were the 5 new duties I was supposed to do in front of the entire unit(idk when this new 5 duty rule came on at all) and literally made me like an idiot in front of others that others are doing a lot while I’m doing nothing since my OC literally asked me to help out my sub superior.

The unit members went against me saying they don’t need me anymore for certain duties. 

One of the duty my SM has asked me to do that I have been doing for months and when I was relocated to this current office from my old one after reporting the discrimination in my previous office, this other unit member took over but still I was asked to do it and I did after that. This unit member literally said in front of everyone that he doesn’t me anymore to make me look I have never been doing anything or I did not help out for the duty at all. When I told my superior that I did this duty, he didn’t believe me and believed every single other guy except me. 

Furthermore, to make things even more complicated, the superior and unit members act as if I wasn’t even asked to another of a duty and pretending they don’t know what it is. I was like “wtf” when I clearly remember them saying I was too In charge of this other duty and I was supposed to learn it too. I did learn this duty many months ago when the upper study guy was just unwilling to teach me and only taught the other guy who was new too but I just joined them and learn the duty standing behind them like a total idiot. 

So basically, all these happened and I feel that they have been trying to target me and make me look that I have not been doing anything which makes me feel extremely disappointed because I have been doing the duties assigned to me all the time and never refused to do anything. I feel the 2 reasons is because that Im discriminated for going IMH and my parent recently intervened to report the discrimination a few months back and they think that I’m a weakling. 

So I have told all these to my psychologist and psychiatrist for help and what am I supposed to do and they literally said it in a nice way that I have been perceiving things wrong and they can’t help me and only my parent can intervene. It was the most stupidest thing I have ever heard. Basically they are trying to say that work life is important than your own health? If they are asking my parent to involve in it, what happens to those who don’t have supportive parents? Are these psychologists and psychiatrists trying to say suck it up and they can’t help people like me? 

It feels people all are blaming me for everything and it feels awful. I’m feeling extremely anxious since I’m afraid these kind of new problems will come too many times and I will become way too overwhelmed and helpless. 

I honestly don’t know what to do and have been suffering for many months now with toxic superiors and people around me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/jhot37/im_having_a_horrible_and_tough_time_for_many/,1.0,['Call SOS or MINDEF Hotline. \nReally so sorry to hear this.

6,NationalServiceSG,3398,Distorted view of voluntary leadership,hjqdj6,coachman11,1593664365,13,1,"Hi all, and happy (belated) SAF day. Today I will be sharing my take on SAF’s 2nd core value: Leadership. This will be another long post, if you haven’t read my previous one, the link will be provided  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/hgbdvh/dying_culture_and_traditions_in_the_military/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Volunteering for IC or leadership roles has been in the SAF for many generations and can be found in almost every unit. From the section/platoon ICs in your BMT to IC roles in your unit, there are many opportunities to take up some leadership experiences in the SAF. However, many do not realize the true intention and takeaway for such voluntary actions.

For BMT, many would think that volunteering as an IC within your company will guarantee you a spot in command school. Frankly speaking, this is not the case at all (and if such things were to exist, BMT can just close shop already). Everyone gets an opportunity; Everyone will get the chance to be an IC or leader when the time comes, as there are many leadership spots available. Although most may feel that some IC roles are not as important or “ups” as others (Logistics IC, LEARNet IC, Ration IC and so on), I can safely say that your hard work will be noticed and recognized if you put in the effort. In my unit, we have multiple people for one IC role as we believe that everyone deserves an opportunity and we work on rotational basis in order to give each individual some experience.

As an IC, you have to balance the leadership responsibilities as well as maintaining healthy relationship with the people you work with. Toxic leadership is a prime example of an unhealthy leadership trait. These leaders tend to overlook learning experiences and growth, instead they are results driven. Their perception of a leader is skewed as they believe that leadership role = power and most will not admit to mistakes, in turn they’ll blame it on others. Like what Uncle Ben used to say: With great power comes great responsibility. One also has to understand the differences in managing subordinates and peers. It is easy to manage subordinates (because rank differences) without much consideration, but managing your peers is a new ballgame as they are the ones who will support you as much as you back them up in times of crisis.

Withdrawing from leadership roles shouldn’t be something to be ashamed of if you aren’t prepared for it. However, never withdraw for the reason of “I was nominated by my friend” or “So and so guy sabo me” as it shows your lack of professionalism. Make your own decision, if there are certain reasons on why you would like to withdraw, don’t be afraid to do so. The last thing anybody would want is to have an indecisive or unprepared IC in the company.

Leading self before others is also a key factor in successful leadership. To lead others is to lead by example; Nothing is more difficult than leading from the front, to be able to adhere to your values, progress towards purpose and to keep improving yourself. Not to mention servant leadership, which is to serve the people around you in order to grow and develop as a team. That way you are able to be an impactful and inspiring team leader.

For some, volunteering for leadership roles mean they must do well (to save face) as their idea of a successful leader is one who does not make any mistakes at all. Those are also the ones who volunteer to become the best trainee or soldier of the month instead of personal development, however this is far from reality. In my opinion true leadership are leaders who commits a mistake and learn from it, growing as a team, one who prioritizes development over achievements, and I quote “To learn, unlearn and relearn to stay relevant” (bonus points to you if you know who’s quote this is). However, I also do agree that best trainee awards are given out to encourage competitive spirit and meritocracy, but overall it is the attitude that matters.

I will end this off with a short story. One morning Ben invites Joe for a casual run. During the run, Joe will always try to overtake Ben whenever he’s leading. On the other hand, Ben will slow down his pace as he is competing against himself, and he’s not here to beat each other. Everyone has their own objectives, in this case running, and we should be doing our best for what it is. Looking back, I will tend to take other runners as reference whenever I go for a run in order to “beat them mentally”, I feel that this shouldn’t be the case as the real opponent is you yourself, always challenge yourself to improve and be a better leader.

I'd just like to point out some recommendations, and also put in my own experience, to help those that feel lost.

\- Create your own learning by supplementing with outside resources. (Youtubers, google, all make good resources. Especially when what you are studying is a 'fact' - meaning Elbow joint = elbow joint, no matter where you get your resource, it will always be the same!)  


\- Recognize what is important and what is not. Some may disagree, but I sincerely don't think aiming for GPA 5.0 is ideal, unless you are an absolute genius (then what are you doing at NUS?). Knowledge is key, not GPA. You can convey your knowledge through other means when you want to get a nice paying job - write articles, start a blog, Youtube. Everyone has good GPA, but not knowledge and wisdom.  


\- Have a life. It's not easy during this period, I know. But try to mix things up, know that there are other things out there. Once you grow up you'll feel all your anxiety over University is stupid. Be serious about it but also be pragmatic. It's not everything.  


\- Lastly, grow some balls. Don't like a prof? Feedback. Don't like that project groupmate? Tell him/her that. Don't like your degree? Find another way. There's many ways to live life.

If you just take usp, kindly inform me whether its worth it. Hows cinnamon college culture (toxic / accomadating/) i also fear a sense of elitism in usp, kinda abhors me. 

Thankzzzz!!

He mentioned that likely because of the workload, everyone(yes no joke) before him in that combination subsequenly had to drop USP along the way. He added that he was hoping to press on and become the first one to complete it. This is just what he said, so i guess you have to decide yourself if you are willing to endure the stress described.']"
