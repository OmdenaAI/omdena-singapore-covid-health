Of these, 31 were local cases with 13 linked to existing clusters or individuals, while 18 remained unlinked.\n\n&gt; Tuesday\'s numbers bring the total to 926. There remain 420 cases in hospitals, with 22 patients critically ill and in intensive care. There have been three deaths.\n\n&gt; Among the linked cases, certain patterns have emerged, said Associate Professor Kenneth Mah, the director of medical services. Many were linked by activity, including social gatherings, workplaces, or being members of the same household, he said.\n\n&gt; Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said that telecommuting is a critical part of safe distancing, particularly in workplaces.\n\n&gt; ""There is a lot of scope for us to do more, especially the private sector firms,"" she said.\n\n&gt; She noted that the public sector has taken the lead on adapting to the changed work environment.\n\n&gt; For example, the Urban Redevelopment Authority and the Infocomm Media Development Authority allow 90 per cent of its employees to telecommute.\n\n&gt; While some private companies such as Bloomberg have also done ""exceedingly well"", she estimated that most firms in the central business district are still recalling 60 per cent of their workers back to office.\n\n&gt; She said MOM will be stepping up enforcement in coming weeks.\n\n&gt; But she also reassured firms that a ""measured approach"" will be taken when it comes to punishment meted out in what is already a period of economic hardship for many companies.\n\n&gt; ""I should say its not our intention to simply issue a stop-work order without considering the circumstances of the companies,"" she said.\n\n&gt; ""We are looking for evidence that companies have made serious attempts to implement stay at home telecom arrangements but we are also mindful that this is not always possible,"" she said, citing manufacturing firms as an example.\n\n&gt; ""But one thing is very clear, 100 per cent is better than 80, 80 is better than 60.. So even if companies have implemented some telecommuting measures, we will ask the important question of whether we can do more,"" she said.\n\n&gt; Mr Wong said that outside the workplace, social gatherings are another area in which Singaporeans can do more,\n\n&gt; He noted that many people have asked whether they can hold gatherings in their home with the limit of 10 people.\n\n&gt; ""But that really misses the point,"" he said.\n\n&gt; Added Health Minister Gan Kim Yong: ""It is not a question of whether you can or you cannot (do these things), the key question is whether you need to have these activities.""\n\n&gt; Tuesday\'s conference was the first held virtually with reporters dialling in.\n\n&gt; The task force members stressed the importance of keeping seniors safe.\n\n&gt; People should wash their hands before interacting with the elderly and also not visit them if they are ill, the multi-ministry task force combating the spread of the virus urged on Tuesday (March 31).\n\n&gt; This is so as the elderly are more vulnerable if infected with the new coronavirus - they have shown a higher risk of developing serious conditions both internationally and in Singapore, the task force said.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)', '[removed]', 'This is finally happening...At least the risk of infection via taking public transport could minimize a bit', 'Why not set parliament as example?

Now all 10 of you are at risk… You may say it’s jut a meal, it’s just 1 night hanging out at home. Multiply that by hundreds of friend groups doing the same across the country.

The mall had also stationed staff at entrances. Using handheld counters, they kept track of how many shoppers entered the mall.\n\n&gt; Popular stores such as sportswear brand Lululemon and Japanese retailer Muji still had queues of customers. Safe distancing measures such as keeping 1m apart were observed.\n\n&gt; At Tangs, markings were placed on the floor at almost every juncture, including in the toilets - constant reminders for shoppers to keep a safe distance apart.\n\n&gt; Since Friday, malls, attractions and other public venues have had to limit their capacity and disperse groups of more than 10 or face penalties if they are later found to have been a place of transmission for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\n&gt; Most shoppers interviewed said they were taking precautions and would limit the time they spent outside.\n\n&gt; Marketing communications manager Zen Yip, who is in her early 40s, was out with her husband at Ion Orchard ""for a breather"".\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Safe distancing at Wisma Atria on March 28, 2020. ST PHOTO: TIMOTHY DAVID\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; ""I think it\'s fine to be out as long as we take every safety precaution and keep to the basic rules, like washing your hands and observing your personal hygiene,"" she said.\n\n&gt; She had attended a baking class at the mall, which had also reduced the number of students.\n\n&gt; Related Story Safe distancing rules kick in: Readers share what they saw in public places\n\n&gt; ""It\'s hard for all of us to be staying home all the time. Sometimes, we just need to come out for a breather, to do some exercise,"" said Ms Yip, who said she will take other precautions like limiting the time spent outside.\n\n&gt; Ms Shania Loh, 22, a student at Nanyang Technological University, said she believes the malls and shops were all taking safe distancing very seriously.\n\n&gt; ""Some stalls allow only 10 people in or so. I queued for 45 minutes to get into one but the staff were very good - they came out to check that we maintained a safe distance even within the queue"" said Ms Loh.\n\n&gt; On Saturday morning, the Gov.sg WhatsApp channel sent a reminder for the public to visit malls only for essential goods such as food, to keep at least a distance of 1m from others, and buy groceries online.\n\n&gt; Ms Loh said she had seen the advisory and will try to go out less often now.\n\n&gt; Storekeeper Muliyadi Pagi, 50, was at Tangs with his wife and son to buy a pot.\n\n&gt; He estimates that they spent only 20 minutes in the store, and were heading home when he spoke to ST.\n\n&gt; When asked if he felt safe being out and about during this period, he said it was a ""50-50"" feeling.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Safe distancing in place at Ion Orchard on March 28, 2020.

You never know; maybe you don\'t have it, but others might have it,"" he said.\n\n&gt; A shopper who wanted to be known only as Alex said he had go to the bank to sign some documents, and had dropped by Bugis Junction to buy some necessities.\n\n&gt; The 38-year-old civil servant said: ""It\'s hard to stay away because some of these errands can\'t be done online.""\n\n&gt; Mall operators said they had taken strong measures to implement safe distancing, including limiting carpark spaces, deploying staff to track the number of visitors and keeping to the guideline of no more than one person per 16 sq m of usable space.\n\n&gt; There were also fewer people heading to the heartland malls. Shoppers at malls such as Junction 8 and Tiong Bahru Plaza said there were noticibly less patrons on Saturday afternoon.\n\n&gt; Yoga instructor Eliza Lek, 33, who was at Junction 8 to buy groceries said: “I wouldn’t have left the house if we weren’t all out of food. I have to shop for my family of five. We have designated just one person to leave the house to do grocery shopping.”\n\n&gt; Over at Tiong Bahru Plaza, shopper Abhyudit Dev, 25, has been visiting the mall only to buy goods from the supermarket.\n\n&gt; Noting that many people visit the mall in the evenings, the marketing executive said: ""While many of us are working from home, we only find time to log off from work and attend to our essential needs in the evenings. I will try to visit during lull periods instead of peak periods.""\n\n&gt; Government agencies have also stepped up efforts to help implement the new measures.\n\n&gt; In a joint statement on Saturday, the authorities said they deployed staff on the ground to help guide and ensure that food and beverage, retail and tourism establishments comply with measures.\n\n&gt; If establishments do not comply, ""they will be guided on finding suitable solutions"", said the statement, which was issued by Enterprise Singapore (ESG), the Housing Board, the National Environment Agency, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), the Singapore Tourism Board, and the Urban Redevelopment Authority.\n\n&gt; It added that those who still fail to comply with the safe distancing measures after follow-up checks may be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act and other regulations.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Wisma Atria on March 28, 2020. Many malls have also implemented crowd control measures, restricting entry to certain entrances and limiting the number of customers at any one time.

If the measures are still not implemented, ESG and SFA will issue an official warning letter to the business owner. Following this, a third visit will be made for further checks on compliance.\n\n&gt; The statement said: “Businesses that are found to have violated the Infectious Diseases Act and regulations promulgated thereunder may be liable for an offence and charged.”\n\n&gt; ESG and SFA have not issued warning letters so far.\n\n&gt; Even as the Government urged consumers to stay home and place shopping orders online, supermarkets and online grocery shopping services said they were doing their best to cope with rising demand.\n\n&gt; A Lazada spokesman said the company\'s e-grocer RedMart has implemented purchase limits on specific product categories and is making changes to the online store\'s assortment to ensure that there are enough daily essentials for customers.\n\n&gt; He said: ""We are working hard to increase our fulfilment capacity to meet the rising demand and welcome companies who can support to partner with us.""\n\n&gt; A spokesman for Dairy Farm, which runs Cold Storage and Giant, said that with an increase in traffic both in store and online, ""we would like to assure our customers that all our team members are working around the clock to ensure our customers get what they need"".\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)', 'Isit OK to sit at the marked spot if it is 2 friends together?

Ensure clear physical spacing of at least 1m apart at work premises. Stagger working hours. Defer or cancel all events. Implement shift or split team arrangements.\n\n&gt; MOM officers have visited over 100 companies in the past four days. 34 of the companies were issued with Stop Work Orders (SWO).\n\n&gt; “Employers must place clear signages to ensure wider physical spacing (of at least 1m apart) for work stations and meeting rooms. The same safe distancing measures should also apply to common spaces, such as entrances/exits, lifts, pantries, staff canteens and other congregation areas. Enforcement actions will be taken, including ceasing operations until employers or occupiers put in place the stipulated measures.”\n\n&gt; According to MOM, this is what an SWO entails.\n\n&gt; “SWO is served to any person to immediately cease work in the workplace when there is an imminent danger to the safety and health of persons at work. It is issued with a set of instructions directing the recipient to take such measures to remedy any danger so as to enable resumption of work.”\n\n&gt; Usually, an SWO will last two to three weeks so companies can resolve these issues. However, according to the post by MOM, companies were required to make immediate rectifications.\n\n&gt; 36 remedial orders were also issued.\n\n&gt; Image from MOM\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)', 'PSA:\nWhere employees can perform their work by telecommuting from home, the employer must ensure that they do so.

So we will not want to do something dramatic, sudden, that will result in school closure,"" he said.\n\n&gt; ""We still have options, we are not like many countries where they are forced into sudden school closures.""\n\n&gt; When asked how long this home-based learning arrangement will last, Mr Ong said: ""It depends how long the virus lasts, and how long we feel it will be around.""\n\n&gt; From next Monday (March 30), schools will provide instructions to students and parents on accessing the home-based learning materials. Assistance will be given to students who do not have access to digital devices when their learning requires it.\n\n&gt; Students will have about four to five hours of learning on the day of home-based learning, of which two hours can be used to access digital devices.\n\n&gt; It can come in different forms, through e-lessons, or other references like worksheets and textbooks. Teachers could also conduct lessons via ""live"" videos.\n\n&gt; Related Story Coronavirus: Education Minister Ong Ye Kung responds to concerns on schools reopening\n\n&gt; Schools will remain open for a small group of students whose parents are not able to make alternative childcare arrangements, and priority will be given to parents working in essential services such as healthcare or public transport.\n\n&gt; A small number of teachers in schools will supervise these students.\n\n&gt; Most teachers will stay at home on the day of home-based learning, while about 20 per cent of staff, including the principal, will remain in school.\n\n&gt; Co-curricular activities (CCAs) will remain suspended for the rest of Term 2, and so will other activities that involve mingling of students across schools like the National School Games.\n\n&gt; The Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation will be cancelled.\n\n&gt; On Sunday, Mr Ong had said that he received many questions from parents, with some asking why the March holidays were not extended, especially given the rising numbers of imported Covid-19 cases and impending border closures.\n\n&gt; He cited scientific evidence showing that young people are not spreaders of the virus, and said that closing schools would also disrupt the lives of many people, particularly parents who are both working, and who have limited childcare options.\n\n&gt; Various precautionary measures have already been put in place and hygiene protocols have been stepped up. Students now only spend their time with those in their classes, with CCAs and inter-school activities suspended.\n\n&gt; Related Story Schools roll out programmes to teach students about the coronavirus and how to spot fake news\n\n&gt; They sit apart in class and are reminded to wash their hands regularly and avoid touching their faces.\n\n&gt; Communal activities such as mass assemblies and school camps have been suspended. Recess timings are staggered and temperature checks are conducted daily.\n\n&gt; Students who are not feeling well - be it with a cough, sore throat or a fever - will be placed in an isolation room in school or sent home.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

Knowledge IS power and there is so much misinformation out there! Don't just believe what you heard months ago from the media, friends or relatives. Read actively, reflect and ask questions as we find out new things about the virus everyday. 

Hopefully you will realise that we are dealing with a very potent and invisible enemy. We must not fear excessively, but just enough to make good decisions. Hoarding is not the answer, neither is blaming or name calling. This virus does not discriminate between our age, gender, race, religion, economic background. Any one of us can potentially be infected right now and not know until much later, after we have infected many people.

It is in such hard circumstances that our true natures as individuals and as a nation will show. Let us stay united and show our concern for one another. Stay safe and take care, everyone!

The strict measures we have taken — border controls, restricting travel, safe distancing, suspending religious services, and closing of entertainment outlets and tuition centres — are meant to curb the spread of the disease, to flatten the curve, and slow down the infection rate. 

Around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to worsen. We too expect to see more cases, as more overseas Singaporeans return home. It is crucial for these returnees to comply strictly with their Stay Home Notices. You must protect your families and everyone else, in case you turn out to be infected, which unfortunately some returnees will be. Glad that many are behaving responsibly by staying home, but some are not. Please comply – it is irresponsible to gallivant off to eat local food you miss, or to go partying with friends, when you are supposed to stay at home and isolate yourself. You will also be breaking the law. 

Lawrence Wong spoke for us all when he gave heartfelt thanks to our healthcare workers, public officers, volunteers, and many unsung heroes who are fighting hard against COVID-19.

shadow_f4,1584864343,fmwfh0,38,1,"Hi r/Singapore, 

Here's my thoughts on the current situation. Considering the constant continuous rise in numbers of confirmed cases in Singapore and around the world, the situation in Singapore seems even more critical now as we recall even more Singaporeans even back home - the next 2 weeks will truly determine the fate of this outbreak.

As local clusters still begin to form, and the number of untraced cases over the past few days continue to rise, our resources grow scarce and it becomes much harder to deal with the situation, despite the social distancing measures that the government has employed. Some companies have begun to trial work-from-home initiatives, but I still feel that the numbers are still insufficient in dealing with this critical situation as there are still many companies out there who will not do anything until the government forces them to do so by adopting a 'wait-and-see' approach. Albeit, such measures will likely cause huge disruptions to our lives and our economy, but in the face of Singapore closing its borders to all short-term visitors, working from home as an alternative pales in comparison to the seriousness of this situation and companies should be socially responsible in adopting such policies. Many people have complained about how the social distancing measures enacted this week - in which they do not appear to be very feasible? Just look at the number of people on the packed trains during peak hour.

Similarly, in the case of schools. It seems ridiculous for the government to encourage all companies to adopt a work-from-home policy when they still insist upon not closing schools. I feel that especially nowadays, especially as most people have sufficient technology in accessing e-learning platforms (and those left out have facilitated access by schools), e-learning is the right way to go instead to minimise social contact in schools. Come on, look at the social distancing measures adopted in schools - on paper it looks feasible, but if you look at the reality, with over a thousand school-going children continuously interacting still despite staggered breaks etc., it seems like a hotbed for spreads. Wipe-down measures are recommended but left to the elderly cleaners (who have been said to be the most susceptible) and the most questionable decisions are to go to school and sit in the classrooms to do e-learning, in which there is bare minimisation of social contact.

Admittedly, MOE's concern of disrupting parents' work, especially for those working in the healthcare sector, is valid, but in this point of time, asking people to work from home but leaving children in schools may not be the most feasible idea. Why can't we just leverage upon our technological capabilities to keep everyone safe and still prevent our economy from coming to a standstill? Let us be more socially responsible and truly understand the situation overseas - where death tolls have been continuously mounting and understand how lucky we are for now with timely measures - but more severe ones must surely be taken. 

Dear Singaporeans, let us tide through this entire situation safely.",singapore,222663,COVID-19: Is working-from-home and MOE's actions sufficient?,,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fmwfh0/covid19_is_workingfromhome_and_moes_actions/,"[""on the face of it it's not sufficient\n\nbut do u think we can pull off a Wuhan-style complete lockdown? cos its the only way to prevent crowded trains and school"", 'No. Social distancing is not happening. People are travelling. RIP', 'Actually if you think about it, the SBS buses and MRTs are so crowded. *TOUCH WOOD* If an unidentified Covid 19 person sneeze, cough  and then hold on to the railing or anywhere else in the bus without cleaning his hands, there will be a chance of the infection spreading.', 'As a student, my own personal opinion is that MOE’s actions are now looking increasingly insufficient.\n\nFirst, like what you mention, thousands of students congregate within a school during school hours. From what I observe in my JC, students bottleneck at school entrances in the morning where the risk of transmission for pathogens is inherent. Moreover, prior to the March holidays, I have witnessed throngs of students queueing for food in the school canteen. Crowds exceed whatever I have personally witnessed in hawker centres on weekends or shopping malls during recess periods. Even with social distancing measures implemented by MOE, such forms of contact and crowding are in a sense inevitable given constraints to infrastructure and timetabling.\n\nSecond, I feel that my experience in school is being affected immensely, to the point where closing schools may make students better off. With the new measures implemented over the holidays and fixed seating, my recess timings have been affected. I will have to share a canteen bench with another class and it just so happens that the bench can only accommodate one class at once. Yet, my recess timings clash on some days with this class meaning that there may not be enough space for my class to consume food. Moreover, activities in class such as group discussion and other project style activities have greatly reduced. With CCAs being cancelled as well, I would have to say these measures have adversely affected interaction with peers. \n\nGiven all these factors, I really feel as if travelling to school jeopardises my safety and I believe it may be time to seriously consider closing schools. This is just my own personal opinion based on what I feel and observe from my JC.', 'Very much same thoughts. Singapore is the only country which has not closed down the schools  nor reduced the frequencies of public transports to limit the exposure.', 'Did anyone say work from home - I am still going to work.', 'Okay, let’s try to answer a few questions before we proceed:\n\n1) How long will the covid situation last? \n\n2) Do the benefits of a lockdown outweigh the costs?\n\n\nWell, we don’t know how long it will last, when it will end, so you can’t go on a lockdown with no deadline. The situation is really not THAT bad to warrant a lockdown yet, although it might worsen. Do we know if it will worsen? No we also don’t. \n\nNow what benefits does a lockdown provide? It gives a temporary, and emphasis - TEMPORARY, relief to curb the virus from spreading. Will it mean the virus completely does not spread? No. Will the virus completely stop spreading when the time to end the lockdown comes? Don’t know. When do we end the lockdown? Don’t know too. \n\nThis means complete economic uncertainty. You’re asking the government to promote economic uncertainty and inefficiency when it is already guaranteed we will enter a recession this year. A lot of people will lose their jobs. If you want the economy to return to normalcy as soon as the virus situation is over, then a lockdown is really not the best way. \n\nUltimately a lockdown may occur, but everything is about the timing. Going straight into a lockdown now may bring more harm than delaying it by, say, two weeks. \n\nThe situation is bad but it really isn’t THAT bad yet. YET. So wait and see will be the right thing. \n\nNow when will be the “right” time then? My guess would be when the number of unlinked cases start to rise, or (touch wood) even explode. Then that would definitely warrant a lockdown. For now, no. \n\nFor example, look at the big hoo-ha surrounding that VJC teacher case. Did any other related cases explode from there? Did any VJC students get infected? Not that we know of, right? It’s okay to be careful, but letting fear overrule logical decisions and mathematical probabilities would really not be the ideal thing to do in this climate.', 'Every other country has done this ( even democracies). Not saying we should, but Singapore can definitely take stronger measures such as enforcing work from home', ""shouldn't one increase frequencies so that its less crowded?"", ""I agree there is scope for discussion around this topic. SG is pursuing quite a different strategy from other nations. Time will tell whether it was smart or foolish. At the moment they are still holding well, and the evidence (cases, deaths) point to a viable strategy that they can continue.\n\nI believe much of their decisions revolve around the single concept that this pandemic might stretch for months and months and months. Hence they postulate the scenario during planning: what if the schools are closed for 6 months, what will happen? when will it end? what is the indicator to close schools, what is the indicator to open schools? Have you considered this?\n\nThis is the same criteria for all other measures they are taking. \n\nSimilar for work, they are discouraging travel, but not total lockdown. I believe we will see first a single-school lockdown, and if it spreads, then multiple schools, the entire school system. Alternatively, temporary short 'brakes', like a 14 day stop school, instead of perpetual. \n\nThey have indicated many times they have lots of different options, but everyone keep asking, why not total lockdown, as if there are no other choices. \n\nIf we get a crazy 1000 person local community transmission overnight all over the island without any trace, I am sure they will do the temporary lockdown."", 'Get ready for a ton of down votes. We all know Singaporeans care more about exams and business than the health of the general populace. I feel this is why the govt hasnt taken stricter measures.. too hard to enforce. The government has taken EXCELLENT measures but those r only restricted to treating/tracking patients after the fact.', 'me too :(', 'pretty sure the factory/blue-collar workers feel the same, if it were so easy closing all these places lol', 'You do realize that the exams cannot be postponed, right? \n\nAnd a “lockdown” now will actually just mean moving the holidays around so you all still get the same amount of curriculum time.', 'Yes. Obviously I myself do not want curriculum time to be reduced as far as possible (it is my A level year) but given the current situation I feel that we should seriously consider closing schools.', 'E learning is nowhere near sufficient as of now.  Im currently developing E learning modules for my workplace to onboard new hires and already its taken a few months.   I cant imagine how long it will take to develop a coherent syllabus for multiple subjects.  Also,  the company that develops the platform, BlackBoard, happens to be Wizlearn Tech which was one of the clusters.\n\n\nE learning requires resources and time to develop, and it wont be ready for another couple weeks if not months', 'I understand your frustrations. I guess at this point the opportunity costs associated with a lockdown are simply too huge, and really, I don’t think teachers want to cope with the travesty that is E-Learning, and many of them probably have their own families (with kids) too. They can’t teach you when their kid is running around at home needing their care too.', ""The government seems to be good in taking an evidence-based approach. Whenever they see a particular mode of transmission they act to shut it down: seniors' activities, mosques, imported cases.  So far there is no evidence of any spread in schools and children do not seem easily susceptible to the virus (I believe only about 2% of all cases in Singapore are under the age of 20)."", ""you're not wrong- many people will outwardly say that they're all for school closure and much stricter measures in order to make sg safer despite the fact that majority of them would rather prioritize their studies and work.\n\nTo be fair though, even though the situation is dire, school closure would fuck up both my education and the education of many others taking major exams this year- if we're being honest, SLS just ain't cutting it man"", 'Let’s get this out of the way. \n\nSchool closure is not the answer. \n\nChildren do not watch themselves at home. \n\nParents will have to take care of them. \n\nThis means frontline HCWs and other essential services will lose manpower. \n\nThere is already a strain on frontline HCW, so it’s not a good idea. \n\nChildren who are home may not stay home either. The parents might be tempted to bring them to Universal Studios or a playgym or go shopping perhaps. \n\nThere is also no widespread local transmission. Most of the cases are imported - Singaporeans returning back from overseas. \n\nClosing down the city will impact many people’s livelihoods unneceaaarily. \n\nThe policy makers consider these aspects of the issue and I think they made the right choice to keep schools open.', 'Agree. It will be very difficult to enforce adequate physical distancing among school children. \n\nSchool will eventually be closed once cases increased.\n\nGovernment can come out with measures to provide assistance or monitoring to families where the parents need to be at work e.g. healthcare workers.', ""Here's the facts so far;        \n      \nTotal cases: 430\nActive cases: 290     \nImported cases: 228     \nNon import: 62      \n        \nWhat does each of these numbers mean and which is more important? First, active cases is more important than total cases, since it represents the current situation more accurately. And active cases can be broken down to imported or local cases.     \n           \nNext, imported cases will have lessser impact than non import. These includes sg residents MFA rescued from overseas and tested/quarantined immediately.     \n      \nLast is the most important of them all, local cases. They are the most likely to spread the virus to others in sg, with each case potentially creating a cluster.    \n        \nSo in my opinion, 62 local cases isnt cause for panic yet, and with the ban on short term visits, it seems manageable.     \n         \nI might be wrong though, feel free to refute anything i posted."", 'Fucking easy.

But for now, people waiting for the next cluster (hopefully from school/work) then they can flame the gov :)', ""March school holidays can be extended.\n\nThey are already much more unlinked cases.\n\nLet's be truthful, the only reason why schools are not lock down is because it is socially disruptive to working parents."", '&gt;Time will tell whether it was smart or foolish.\n\nAh the hindsight bias', 'Not sure if every company has the capability to let their employees work from home .', '1) Until when will you extend the holidays? How many weeks? Will the situation be better?\n\n2) There is no “free” extension. Extending the March holidays means a shorter, or even complete removal of the June holidays. Students need a break, teachers also need a break. \n\n3) Exams cannot be postponed, unless you are asking the students to take their ‘O’ and ‘A’ levels next year. Students who are taking exams this year are severely disadvantaged. \n\n4) E-learning is a travesty. It’s ineffective, inefficient, and really unproductive. \n\n5) Teachers don’t get to work from home, but their kids are on stay home notice. If teachers work from home, they have to take care of their children.', ""Honestly, I feel that even if students in Singapore don't have lessons for 6 months it's fine. They could be behind but they can catch up.\n\nThe issue here is Singapore is trying to reduce business impact as well as contain the spread of the virus.\nLike you said, if school close, parents need to take care of them which might affect the parent's work. If parents leave them be, some of them are going to meet anyways.\n\n\nIn your post, I don't see a solution give that meets the government's and people's need. If there isn't a balance between economical impact and controlling the virus I doubt the government will do anything too drastic"", ""Students don't stop existing when schools are shut. Teenagers will end up going out to hang out with their friends, especially if the closure lasts longer than a couple of weeks, which is looking increasingly likely considering what's happening in the UK, HK, etc. \n\nIt's either letting them roam or an adult needing to stay at home. Plus contact tracing in schools is much easier than in the public, and I'm sure students are constantly nagged by teachers to maintain some standard of personal hygiene."", 'How about making schools (primary + secondary) dual sessions again (morning and afternoon) like the primary schools in the past? \n\nAs there are no CCA for now, school hours can be stretched. Maybe some classes can be held in morning, some in afternoon.

Your productivity and will to live will fucking rot.', ""As a student, I regretfully have to inform you despite all the talk on the current state of our e-learning platforms, even as a student you can tell the teachers and schools have little confidence on the performance of the platform compared to that of traditional methods. Even in schools that are comparatively very innovative and accepting of new technologies and their implementation in schools, I'm looking at schools like Nan Chiau Pri that had a very innovative mobile learning system previously, I doubt it surprises anyone that they still prefer traditional schooling so long as the current state of education with its hard focus on continuous written papers and examinations persist.\n\nAnd even if they were, let's be real, the people with the least confidence on this system is the parents. Would they really trust their kid alone at home in front of a screen to study?"", 'Did you fail your math or something ? Total cases : 430, imported cases 228, how can non imported cases be just 62 ?

That's where you get 62 local cases from."", 'This is the problem when people starts to toss numbers that aren’t defined properly in forums like this. It isn’t 62 local cases. It is 62 active cases derived from local transmission. It makes a big difference when you think about it and it would be seen as an attempt to be down playing the actual numbers.', 'It isn’t FACTS when you are providing numbers are ill defined/ mislabeled to promote your agenda or hypothesis. It is just plain intellectual dishonesty.', 'Good idea actually, this would fit into the staggered hours that MOH is advising employers to implement.', 'Certain companies cannot WFH - and I believe at least 1/2 of the economy cannot.\n\nIf schools are closed, these parents will need to find arrangements to lookafter the kids.

We don\'t want to add to their load, and therefore, it is important to add these measures to ensure our healthcare workers have the capacity to look after our patients.""\n\n&gt; Singapore has witnessed a recent uptick in new cases daily that has been largely due to a sharp increase in imported cases, as Singaporeans studying and working abroad return home from other countries where the number of infections continue to rise.\n\n&gt; Of the 40 cases confirmed on Friday, three-quarters were imported.\n\n&gt; There were only 33 imported cases from Jan 23 to March 9, with this number rising to 156 from March 10 to March 20.\n\n&gt; Imported cases have also nearly caught up with non-imported ones for Singapore\'s total of 385 cases.\n\n&gt; Stressing that is cannot be business as usual, task force co-chair Lawrence Wong, the Minister for National Development, said that the aim was to have fewer people out and about, and a reduction in social gatherings and any activity that could be a potential social vector for the virus.\n\n&gt; On how the safe distancing measures will be enforced, Mr Wong said this can be done in several ways.\n\n&gt; For example, food and beverage outlets that are licensed will have to close some tables.\n\n&gt; ""So it is not an option, it is not advisory, it is mandatory,"" he said.\n\n&gt; ""We will start tomorrow and it will take some time to roll out fully but we will aim to do so as quickly as possible.""\n\n&gt; He added: ""We do not want to see crowded venues, we do not want to see packed event halls. We should see more work from home, more takeaways.""\n\n&gt; ""We will be enforcing the rules. There will be some inconvenience but we also need all Singaporeans to cooperate. And if we are all very disciplined about this it will give us better control and enable us to control spread of virus.""\n\n&gt; Mr Gan had announced on Wednesday that non-Covid patients could be transferred to private hospitals to free up capacity at public hospitals.\n\n&gt; He also said there are plans to convert normal wards into isolation wards, and quarantine facilities into care centres for Covid-19 patients with less severe symptoms if the number of cases here continue to rise.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)', 'Are churches finally going to close', 'I genuinely want to know how the whole 1 m, social distancing thing wil work.\n\nPublic transport, just impossible.

dappercorg,1584429160,fk0y27,9,1,"As the status of the global corona virus pandemic continues to develop and worsen, the sentiments us Singaporeans have towards the disease is likely to change rapidly due to our geographical location, and our role as a country within ASEAN and Asia.

So much so, that in Singapore I've been seeing two sides of the coin on a daily basis. I've seen people who rush at the earliest indication of a worsening situation to buy an unnecessary amount of groceries and provisions. I've seen people sharing every bit of information they can access about the pandemic to their families and friends, regardless of its accuracy or credibility. I've seen people also sharing posts and videos, that not only contain no factual information, but that are designed to fear monger those who watch it. 

However, I've also seen large gatherings of students in public places after school. I've seen people who are sick, and travel on public transport without a face mask. I've overheard people talking about other countries, and how their situation is markedly worse than Singapore's ""as their country doesn't manage these things well"" or ""because their government doesn't know how to handle"". 

Both what Dr. Balakrishnan and PM Lee said during their CNBC interview and National Address, respectively, should resonate strongly with us as a nation. 

As Singaporean citizens, PRs, or residents, we are extremely fortunate that our government, healthcare services, and workers who are dealing with the pandemic, have been able to guide us in handling the COVID-19 situation in the best way possible. 

Whilst we are currently being held in high regard for our country's management of this outbreak since it began at the tail-end of 2019, we cannot let this be a reason for us to become complacent. We have been able to effectively approach COVID-19 due not only to our infrastructure, but also to our actions as individuals. 

Our government's advisory has lead us on the best path so far to combating the severity of this pandemic, and whilst we should be confident in their abilities to guide us going forward, we must always remember that each of us contributes to combating this virus effectively. It is up to us to play our part and work together with each other to continue Singapore's effective management of COVID-19.

Whatever demographic you may be, take care of your personal hygiene, and be respectful of it to those around you. Practice social distancing, even if you are young and are feeling well, because even if you carry COVID-19 but do not show any symptoms, by going out to public common spaces, you could transmit to someone who is much more susceptible to the virus than you are. Always check news sources to ensure information is factual and correct. Do not share media if it does not come from a credible source.

We have been able to set an example to the world on how to combat this virus, so let us all continue to work together to keep ourselves safe, well informed, and prepared for whatever may come by taking a rational and sensible approach to new information as it becomes available to us.

Overnight in Asia, we hosted a call with Professor John Nicholls, a clinical professor in pathology at The University of Hong Kong and expert on coronaviruses. He was a key member of the research team at The University of Hong Kong which isolated and characterized the novel SARS coronavirus in 2003. He has been studying coronaviruses for 25 years. Below are my notes transcribing the call. 

Quick summary: 

Look at the fatality rate outside of Wuhan - it’s below 1%. The correct comparison is not SARS or MERS but a bad cold which kills people who already have other health issues. This virus will burn itself out in May when temperatures rise. Wash your hands.
 
My notes from the call below:
 
Q&amp;A Session with Professor Nicholls:
 
What is the actual scale of the outbreak? How much larger is it compared to the official “confirmed” cases?
 
People are saying a 2.2 to 2.4% fatality rate total. However recent information is very worthy - if you look at the cases outside of China the mortality rate is &lt;1%. [Only 2 fatalities outside of mainland China]. Two potential reasons: 1) either China’s healthcare isn’t as good – that’s probably not the case, 2) What is probably right is that just as with SARS there’s probably much stricter guidelines in mainland China for a case to be considered positive. So the 20,000 cases in China is probably only the severe cases; the folks that actually went to the hospital and got tested. The Chinese healthcare system is very overwhelmed with all the tests going through. So my thinking is this is actually not as severe a disease as is being suggested. The fatality rate is probably only 0.8%-1%. There’s a vast underreporting of cases in China. Compared to SARS and MERS we are talking about a coronavirus that has a mortality rate of 8 to 10 times less deadly to SARS to MERS. So a correct comparison is not SARS or MERS but a severe cold. Basically, this is a severe form of the cold.
 
You mentioned a shortage of testing kit can you talk more about that?
 
There are two ways to detect a virus: 1) Through the genetic material – DNA or RNA or, 2) to detect the protein of the virus. The rapid tests used in a doctors’ labs look at the protein. The problem with that is that you need an antibody to pick it up. And it takes 8-12 weeks to make commercial antibodies. So right now for the diagnostics tests they are using PCR which give you a turnaround in 1-2 hours. But then you need to run a machine and run 96 runs in 1 hour but then you have to a batch of samples so there’s another delay of 5-6 hours for patient presentation. So that will lead to some problems you can’t turnaround in 5-10 mins which is what you want when a patient shows up to the emergency room. Because right now you also have influenza going around so what you want is to be able to rule out influenza so you can treat the patients correctly for coronavirus. So that may be why they missed some of the earlier cases.
 
Your colleague at HKU estimated that the size of the infected population on Jan 25th was 75K with a doubling time of 6.4 days. So by Feb first we would have 150k infected. How accurate do you think these models are and how accurate have they been in the past?
 
Those figures did not take into account restriction on travel, quarantine etc. These reports are likely on the high side. This is not taking into account social distancing. Historically, these models have not been all that accurate.
 
When do you think this thing will peak?

Three things the virus does not like: 1) sunlight, 2) temperature, and 3) humidity. To make you guys really worried. A coronavirus can survive on a stainless steel surface for 36 hours. It hangs around for quite a bit.
 
Sunlight will cut the virus ability to grow in half so the half-life will be 2.5 mins and in the dark it’s about 13 mins to 20 mins. Sunlight is really good at killing viruses. That’s why I believe that Australia and the southern hemisphere will not see any great infections rates because they have lots of sunlight and they are in the middle of summer. And Wuhan and Beijing is still cold which is why there is high infection rates.
 
In regards to temperature, the virus can remain intact at 4 degrees or 10 degrees for a longer period of time. But at 30 degrees then you get inactivation. And high humidity the virus doesn’t like it either. That is why I think SARS stopped around May and June in 2003 – that’s when there’s more sunlight and more humidity. The environment is a crucial factor. The environment will be unfavourable for growth around May. The evidence is to look at the common cold – it’s always during winter. So the natural environment will not be favourable in Asia in about May.
 
The second factor is that of personal contact. With SARS once it was discovered that the virus was spread through the fecal oral route, there was much less emphasis on the masks, and far more emphasis on disinfection and washing hands. HK has far more cleanliness (than China) and they are very aware of social hygiene. And other countries will be more aware of the social hygiene (than China). So in those countries you should see less outbreaks and spreading. A couple days ago the fecal-oral route of transmission was confirmed in Shenzhen. In China, most of the latrines are open-  there’s more chance of phermites (?) being spread. But in other countries the sanitations systems tends to closed. My personal view is that this will be a bad cold and it will all be over by May.
 
People talk about the vaccine and this is the big problem that people get from movies. Where in the movie they come out with a vaccine and then three days later it’s all over the world and everybody is saved. In reality this does not happen because for a vaccine you need to go through clinical trials – is it safe and will it work. The last thing you want to do is rush a vaccine too early. If you get any severe reactions, then the anti-vaxxer will just say “I told you so”. You are talking about a working vaccine in 1 to 2 years. With SARS, in 6 months the virus was all gone and it pretty much never came back. SARS pretty much found a sweet spot of the perfect environment to develop and hasn’t come back. So no pharmaceutical company will spend millions and millions to develop a vaccine for something which may never come back. It is Hollywood to think that vaccines will save the world. The social conditions are what will control the virus – the cleaning of hands, isolating sick people etc…
 
What do we know about the transmission rate? It’s been estimated around 2.2 to 2.68. What percent of the patients are transmitting while being asymptomatic?
 
This is a big problem when you talk about asymptomatic that means you have a good diagnostic test- where you can say they are asymptomatic (which we don’t have with this virus).
 
We actually looked at this with MERS where people were saying it had a high fatality. We went to camel abattoirs and took serums from the abattoir workers and found that quite a few had low infections with no symptoms. This is what should have been done at the initial stages at the seafood market. But to do that you need a good diagnostic test. A good diagnostic test is necessary to determine to the transmission rate. Now we have normal human airways and we can now look at how long it takes the virus to replicate in that environment. And that will be very useful to determine those who are asymptomatic carriers.
 
Any sense of whether the estimates of the reproductive number the R0 of 2.5 or 2.7.  Do you think that is high or low. What does that mean?
 
Measles was about 10-15 and influenza is just below 2. I think it’s about 2.2 as it’s being transmitted within the community.
 
Have we seen any super spreaders? We saw that with SARS and MERS.
 
There’s talk about that but the epidemiologists are still overwhelmed so no clear answer. But I don’t think there are any super spreaders.
 
What is the percentage of people transmitting the virus while being asymptomatic?
 
Unlike SARS, patients were symptomatic at about day 5, some of these cases may be asymptomatic until about day 7. That’s based on the first publications. Asymptomatic is probably the first 5 days.
 
There’s a paper published looking a familial cluster with a boy who was shredding the virus and he was asymptomatic.
 
That’s something about kids and we saw this with SARS. Very few kids had very severe disease. We are trying to determine if this is a virus which we call low (unintelligible) kind of inducer or high (unintelligible) kind of inducer.  SARS is high [unintelligible] kind of inducer. This means that when it infects the lower part of the lung, the body develops a very severe reaction against it and leads to lots of inflation and scarring. In SARS what we found is that after the first 10 to 15 days it wasn’t the virus killing the patients it was the body’s reaction.
 
We are doing testing on this now. Is this virus in the MERS or SARS kind picture or is this the other type of virus which is a milder coronavirus like the NL63 or the 229. I think this will be a mild (unintelligible) kind inducer.
 
Case fatality is about 2.5% or so? Do you expect this to change over time? And are you seeing any difference among the young population and older population in terms or mortality rate?

SARS went really for people in their 30 or 50 years. And MERS on the other hand basically is if you have co-morbidity – try and find somebody in the middle east who does not smoke or does not have high blood pressure etc.. The data coming out of China seems to indicate that it’s those with the co-morbidity are most at risk. For the seasonal influenza that’s also what we find. It’s the people with the co-morbidity that have the increase mortality rate.  Having said that there’s a guy in the Philippines who died in his mid-30.
 
I think this looks more like the seasonal influenza where those who die have to co-morbidity.  Now that we have better case control definitions outside of mainland China, we will get a true assessment of the fatality rate. I would now put it at about 0.8% to 1%.  When you look at all the death reports – separate out the deaths from mainland China and outside China.
 
Mortality rate in China – is much higher? Why?
 
Its related to the environment. In the high income countries you don’t have as high a population density, higher level of environment control and hygiene. In Indonesia – it’s unlikely to spread much as it’s very hot and humid. Would this virus move to Africa? I think that’s unlikely – too hot there’s not a lot of travel there. Europe – possibility higher transmission but environmental care is higher.
 
At this stage it’s a really bad cold which can cause problems in people. People are talking about the “lethal virus” but seasonal influenza can cause deaths in elderly but we don’t call that “the lethal influenza”.
 
There’s news reports that antivirals are being used and that it’s working what are your thoughts on that?
 
With SARS it didn’t seem to work at all with the commercially available antivirals. But there seems to be good effects with the case in Washington with the Gilead agent. And it sounds like China will be using it.
 
Interferon works and it has quite a bit of benefit.
 
The problem with the antivirals – because the virus has different ways of replicating within the cell, finding a nice common target has been difficult. But the Gilead agent appears to me to be very promising. We now have the virus growing in our labs/cultures so can now test it to see what will work and not work.
 
Would the opening of the hospitals in China change anything?
What we found with SARS in HK was that a contributing factor to the spread was the overwhelming of the HK healthcare system. Hospitals and doctors were overwhelmed. When China built these Wuhan hospitals – it’s to take the work load off the staff which is likely exhausted.  
 
In HK with SARS we found quite a lot of infection of healthcare workers as they are close and doing invasive procedures. But this time around there is not much evidence of the healthcare workers getting sick or dying (but maybe China is not reporting it) so this may suggest that I think it is not being spread by close aerosol contact but more by the fecal-oral route or with droplets. So it will not be as contagious within hospitals. So getting the two hospitals built it will take a lot of the work load off the other hospitals so it should be a big benefit.
 
The recovery rate now higher than the deaths rate? Thoughts on that?
What we found is that in HK with SARS we didn’t know how long to treat a patient for. Now in China they are using the SARS model but treating patients for shorter time periods so that they don’t get the secondary problems that they did with Sars. Getting actual data on recovery from the mainland is still a bit of a challenge.
 
I’d consider a patient recovered if he’s been discharged. The problem is that with SARS, there were quite a bit of people where the steroid were very beneficial to treat the acute stage and we didn’t know how long the virus would live for so we kept them on the steroids for a long period of time and they came out with all sorts of secondary problems due to the immunosuppression.
 
I haven’t seen any data on the quality of life of those who have been discharged.
 
Evidence of E-coli?
Secondary infection are most likely the cause of deaths of the patients in the Philippines and HK.
 
What does it mean for a patient to have recovered?
That means the patient has been discharged from the hospital. That’s the criteria for Hong Kong. But there’s no good data or guidelines on this.
 
What is the probability that this will be contained and eradicated or will it be endemic in the human population?
If it is like SARS it will not be endemic. It most likely will be a hit and run just like SARS. People talk about mutation but what we found with SARS was that there was no mutation and we have been tracking MERS and we have not seen any severe mutation. This is unlike the common coronavirus which when they replicate they don’t have a ”spell check” so they mutate. So if this virus follows the same path as SARS or MERS it won’t mutate.  This will not be endemic. I think it will burn itself out in about 6 months.
 
Does mortality rate or fatality rate typically increase over time? That was apparently the case with SARS. 
With SARS we didn’t know how long the virus was alive for. So with SARS in the later stages people were not dying of SARS but of the complications of SARS which is why the mortality rate increased. But now people are much more aware of the dangers of over immunosuppression. So the death rate shouldn’t be more severe. Especially with the new hospitals being established which should take some of the workload off of the healthcare workers from Wuhan.
 
If we look at the serious cases being reported it’s about 13% of the total cases being reported. If we assume a 50% mortality rate for the severe cases than we are looking at a mortality rate of 5-6%. Is that a fair assumption?

In Hubei, the milder cases are not making it to the hospital. Because they are so overwhelmed that milder cases are being sent away. So that’s why it’s important not to look at the mortality rate in Wuhan but to look at the mortality rate in Shanghai or Shenzhen or outside of Wuhan. It’s very important to dissect it out.
 
Would it be too early to make conclusion outside of Wuhan? It’s still really early days outside of Wuhan? Are we making assumption with very little data and very early data?

That’s all the data we have to work with. When you are dealing with an epidemic at the early stages – there’s such a variable. But now for political reason people are far more aware of the virus so it won’t be as epidemic as it was early on. There’s far more awareness and controlled environment and changes in social behaviour. Which I’m not sure is taken into account in the models. So it should spread far less outside of Wuhan.",singapore,213035,CLSA Conference call with coronavirus expert,,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f06uuc/clsa_conference_call_with_coronavirus_expert/,"['&gt; Three things the virus does not like: 1) sunlight, 2) temperature, and 3) humidity.   \n\n""Really meh...""  \nTime to fit in more outdoor exercise in the next month or two.', ""When they say wait till May, it'll burn out...

TheStateOfIt,1592912324,hed1fq,44,1,"This'll be a fairly short post, and I may miss out on a few points that could be brought up here, but this is why hosting the election right now is a dumb move.

-------------

**1 -- Unfairly Disadvantages Certain Groups of Voters**

I don't know if there'll be any change to the voting procedure to previous General Elections outside of the simple move of ""*follow safe social distancing, wear masks and stand metres away from each other y'all*"". In which case, this will be a disaster.

You see, in the [Voter FAQs](https://www.eld.gov.sg/faq_voters.html), there is *no mail-in voting* allowed. If you're hospitalised, cannot vote. If you're on a SHN, cannot vote. If you cannot make it, physically, to a voting centre, cannot vote.

This will compromise *several* voters. From those issued a Stay Home Notice, Quarantine Order or similar stuff, they obviously cannot teleport the ballot box to their room, so that's them done. Any elderly or people with pre-existing medical conditions are putting themselves at risk whenever they go out and vote. No matter how few cases there are, there's still cases. It's either risk a life-threatening disease for these people (heck, for others as well) or don't get a chance to make a change for you and everyone else.

**1b -- The Health Risk**

Already touched on it a bit on the last point, but now we all are summoned to gather in one place to vote. Obviously there'd be restrictions at the actual location, but what about transport? What about areas outside the boundaries of polling booths (like nearby malls or similar areas)? Everytime I go out to shop, I have a sense of fear and risk. Now that'll be put into everyone gathering in a single location to vote.

**2 -- Abandons Citizens in the Middle of a Crisis**

Parliament is dissolved. Ministers were often the ones we saw on TV that announced all the changes to current social distancing protocol. Some of these changes were by the week, some were by the day. As much as I don't like the PAP for being not so transparent, at least I can say they were **there**, making changes and finding out how to recover.

However, now, literally *DAYS* after Phase 2 is in place, seeing the biggest lift in restrictions for Covid-19, they choose to leave Parliament. What happens if a sudden spike emerges in cases? What if there's more incidents that arise in this state of entropy known as 2020?

In a pivotal time of crisis, where the ship could sink anytime, the ship has been abandoned just to confer on who should steer it.

(*Disclaimer: I know it's just one institution out of many being dissolved, but still, there's bound to be a knock-on effect after this.*)

**3 -- The Obvious Effect of Covid-19 On Voters**

Okay, now I'm just gonna put a disclaimer here and say anything and everything can affect how people can vote, and how ruling parties, in any scenario, can convince voters to keep voting for them. But in the middle of a global issue, with everyone looking at MPs more than ever, this is probably the biggest point.

I don't know any specific term (not a polsci major), but there's lots of signals being sent that certain national messages targeted towards recovering from Covid-19 are being used for political gain for certain parties (and as much PAP implications this hold, this also applies for several other parties as well). This epidemic is being politicized at a time where, honestly, it shouldn't be. If we're supposed to 'stick together' or whatever the current buzzwords are, the last thing we need to get through this is something that can divide everyone, from families to friends, co-workers to commuters.

**4 -- It's Not Needed**

We literally have until April 2021. We didn't need to drop everything in the middle of the year. We could've waited until Christmas. Or CNY. That's a *loooooong* way away. Why the panic? I know they had it planned for April or some shit before Covid, but why have it now **before the whole situation is dealt with?**

There may be some gaps missing in my argument. This was done *really* quickly in response to the announcement just now. I suggest checking out any other feed that will cover the elections (*say, CAPE or SG Climate Rally or just your parties' webpages*) to get more accurate information about the upcoming elections. I may have missed some info rushing this, so lemme know any other reasons why this election shouldn't be held now.

235series,1592579382,hc2dr6,31,0,"\*Trigger Warning: This post contains content that may be disturbing.\*

Dear motorists,

I’m a cyclist and I love cycling in Singapore. I cycle as a means of commute and as a leisure activity, and I have travelled to almost every part of Singapore by bicycle. What spurred me to write this is the recent events that I as a cyclist have experienced first-hand. Just a month ago, on my way back home after buying dinner for my family, I met a taxi driver at a traffic light who was holding the horn, shouting “走开啦!” (Go Away!) and even attempted to knock me down when the signal turned green. That incident scarred me so badly that within 10 mins of that scene, I experienced a panic attack, and by the time I reached home, the food for my family was cold.

Many motorists in Singapore are fantastic people who care for cyclists, but just a single rotten egg could ruin one’s ride. To motorists who may have hated cyclists, I’m here not to despise you. I’m here to say thank you, for not killing any cyclists, yet.

I have experienced verbal abuse on the road countless times, and while I may be wrong at times, I’d admit that shouting at cyclists does more harm than good. Most phrases shouted are largely built on the stereotypes of cyclists and are not beneficial to improving road safety for each other. Common phrases include: “You never pay road tax, f\*\*\* off and use the footpath”, “You ride so slow, only 30km/h!”, “Wah, you so YP! \*Inserts impromptu rendition of 毕竟深爱过\*”, and at times that could be topped up with a flip of the finger.

Other methods of intimidation by motorists include but not limited to: Brake checking, disregarding safety distancing when overtaking, and tailgating. As a cyclist, I hope you would understand that while you may have good intentions, tailgating does not make us cycle any faster, brake checking does not make us cycle better, and passing closely does not make us magically disappear. Such acts simply scare us. One's self-soothing move can stun another road user and this increases the likelihood of an accident occurrence.

This creates a scenario where cyclists and motorists start having stereotypes against each other, and acting upon such stereotypes on the roads will cause further disharmony and jeopardise traffic safety for both parties. In Singapore’s context, most people tend to have personal biases that cyclists are a menace to road safety despite most having little experience of road cycling due to what is called the herding effect. This effect is further enhanced when bodies of large influence such as government agencies post content of active mobility users getting into trouble on a regular basis. Repetition of hashtags and phrases such as #UpLorry #EyesOnYou on these posts have a psychologically persuasive [effect](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/minds-business/to-be-more-persuasive-repeat-yourself.html) that creates a negative view towards active mobility users.

Hence more often than not, the term “dangerous” in dangerous roads, in the context of cycling in Singapore often does not stem from the design of the road, but how much cyclists and drivers as a collective respect each other’s right of way.

Cycling has its limits, with an average cyclist having an average speed of 25km/h, and 30–35km/h for more seasoned cyclists. Just like other cyclists, I wish I could travel faster on my bicycle, and I hope you would understand that increasing cycling speed takes time, and due to the physics of a human-powered vehicle, it is [nearly impossible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiUE3qDnFtU) to travel at a vehicular speed of 60km/h. Power-assisted bicycles (PAB) are also speed capped at 25km/h and pushing beyond that limit requires more effort than that for a conventional bicycle due to the heavier mass of the PAB.

I have nearly lost my life that day, and I don’t wish other cyclists have to experience such traumatic events or in the worst case scenario, lose their lives due to negligence of safety by other road users. I am currently working with my therapist to overcome this trauma, and I'm hoping to be able to be back on two wheels soon.

So here’s a gentle reminder to keep a minimum safety distance of 1.5m when overtaking us, and if the lanes on the right are available, kindly use them. If it is not safe to overtake, your patience is greatly appreciated, and here’s a thank you in advance for being a caring motorist. If you need a refresher course on such rules, feel free to consult section 166 of the BTT Handbook [here](https://www.singaporetests.com/studyguides/btt-eng-v10.pdf).

I understand, that a mere 2% of the population commute by bicycle, but let us not forget that the 112000 of us are humans. We ride bicycles not because we want to die, but we want to go places, just like you too. Road safety is a shared responsibility, let us be kind and gracious to one another. Ride safe, drive safe, go home safe. 

May I wish you a safe journey. (:",singapore,242742,A taxi driver tried to knock me down.

fangrider99,1592578793,hc276t,40,15,"So today was the first day of Phase 2, and I think it goes without saying that many people are extremley happy that they’re finally able to go out to restaurants and meet friends. However, we still need to remember that COVID hasn’t disappeared, and we still need to be vigilant by continuing to wear our masks. 

I live in the Robertson Quay area, and given that today is the first day of Phase 2, I’ve noted an exponential uptick in the amount of people in the area, especially at this time at night. All the restaurants are open and many people are meeting (in groups clearly more than 5). 

I was taking my dog downstairs to use the bathroom and I saw at least 50% of the people with absolutely no masks worn, standing/congregating around drinking, talking, laughing with NO masks. I think it’s now fine to be out and meet friends, but we should still all be wearing masks if we remain outside around other people. There was also a sizeable amount of people wearing masks but wither not around their nose, or just down on their necks. Only about 10% of people were wearing masks. As I said, I think it’s fine to be excited and happy to be able to see friends again, as it’s not allowed after a long 3 months, but can we please continue to practice safe distancing measures? 

It’s quite ridiculous to see that there are also no social distancing officers in the area at all, especially in an area like this where there’s bound to be a lot of people congregating. Groups of people not wearing any sort of mask is bound to cause community outbreaks, completely undermining the progress made since CB started.

The opening of your companies &amp; returning to jobs is not the solution, the end. It brings about a whole new set of problems. You will be new to things like crowd control, SafeEntry, temperature taking, safe distancing and regular sanitisation. We will do our part - scan, shop, dine and leave.

But there will be a segment of us who will complain ""why like this now?"", ""why so many new places"". I ask of you to be patient, despite the stress. I also give you permission to be assertive while being respectful. Furthermore, if it escalates to anything undesirable, call the authorities. You should know all the options available to you.

It is not going to be easy. We all have a livelihood to sustain and families to feed...while tackling the problems this virus brings. But we stand with you, and we've got your back.

It is not an exaggeration to say that there is growing, palpable discontent and frustration on the ground, about how the COVID-19 crisis is being handled.

Much of the anger is directed at the inconsistencies in policies. On one hand, we want to ensure safe distancing, so we cannot meet friends. Yet on the other hand, crowds are allowed on public transport. Pictures of Minister Khaw removing safe distancing stickers from the MRT certainly do not help. The message that is sent out is inconsistent and often confusing.

Supermarkets like NTUC are crowded, and yet budget stores where we get our toothpaste and other essentials are not allowed to open. You cannot blame us for wondering how policymakers decide which establishments can open and which cannot.

We want to reopen the economy slowly for safety reasons, therefore only some services can resume after the circuit breaker. Restaurants still cannot open to diners; beauty and wellness services remain closed. The reason, we are told, is that beauty services are not essential. Yet, on the other hand, people are allowed to spend three hours in a hair salon getting their hair dyed and permed. Candy stores are allowed to open. 50% discounts are abound in some stores so everyone is rushing to buy chocolates. What is the logic in that?

Schools have reopened. School children are now congregating back at schools. Yet we are not even allowed to see our relatives. I dearly miss my niece and nephew, my auntie, my close friends whom I consider my family. I cannot bear a situation where we are penalized and kept apart even longer because clusters start breaking out from schools and on public transport. Meanwhile, orr parents cannot come to our homes, but we can visit them, 2 at a time. What is the logic in that? And what difference does it make whether it is 2 people or 4 people if we all come from the same household?

We rejoiced when the fortitude budget announced that charities now enjoy a 1 for 1 match of up to $250,000 in donations from Tote Board. However shortly after that we found out that we do not qualify because we have applied for a previous, similar program. What is the point then of announcing this initiative, if another one was already present?

We prided ourselves so much in not having to shut down the economy when COVID-19 first started in January to March 2020. However, we now seem to have swung the other way. We all wish we had more time to spare, but the economy cannot wait. Singapore is bracing for it's worst-ever recession, and many companies are expected to close. My friend who runs a buffet restaurant told me that four years of hard work has gone down the drain in just three months.

We know that the situation is evolving rapidly. We understand how difficult the situation is for policymakers to have to make split-second decisions. We understand that it is a difficult line to tow. Whatever policy is made, there will be people on the other side who are unhappy. However, policy makers need to give more thought into making policies which are consistent and fair.

All Singaporeans want the same thing. We want Singapore to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis as safely as possible. We stand united, and in solidarity. However bit by bit, our confidence is being eroded. I wish so much, to once again feel the immense pride of being a Singaporean, as I did at the beginning of the year, when Singapore handled the crisis swiftly and decisively.",singapore,240028,A rant on Govt's handling of CB that I don't think many would disagree,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gy1wsa/a_rant_on_govts_handling_of_cb_that_i_dont_think/,"['All I can say is vote wisely...', 'As you said, hard to disagree', 'Its a choice between the incumbent  \n\n\nThe party that failed miserably at running a single GRC properly  \n\n\nThe up and coming new kid who failed at even applying for a public events license and is now falling apart before the GE even starts  \n\n\nThe leftist extremist  \n\n\nA racist xenophobic party  \n\n\nThe party that is named after a football club  \n\n\nOr the numerous other clown fiesta parties out there  \n\n\nSG future never look brighter', ""Oh hey!

NTUC has a seat across the table with the Ministers, not the small Mom and Pop shops. Schools are part of the Ministry of Education, whose Minister is on the task force, not Singaporeans who want to see their relatives and friends.\n\nThe solution is localism. How you stop a pandemic, at the local level, is to establish isolated bubbles. Make a circle of people comprised of families and all promises to not mingle with anyone else except the people inside the circle. I mean it seriously. That way, outbreaks are contained within the bubble and not exploding outwards. The reason schools and supermarkets are so bad is because it allows people from different areas to intermingle and keep the fire burning across the whole island. It\'s better for people to go to small, local shops and markets instead of a lot of people all go to one bigger supermarket. The people working at the stores become nexus of disease transmissions.\n\nInstead of allowing people to just go to whatever supermarkets or markets across the islands, what will work better is to not close so many local small shops but ask people to instead of going across the island, standing should-to-shoulder on crowded public transport because ""big box store cheaper, ma"", just go to the nearest shop and purchase what you need there.

Even at this stage, we know so little about the real impact of the disease and it’s virulence. \n\nIt is undeniable that people will feel frustrated about the policies since it directly impacts them. It feels miserable that we can’t do what we usually do. To be fair, the government doesn’t want to keep us in lockdown either. It badly affects the economy. But they have to do what is right. What they do may seem inappropriate for us but I am pretty sure that in the government offices everything they choose to do is based on evidence and not on a whim.\n\nUltimately, the government is comprised of humans. There is just that much they can do. There are many many appropriate exceptions they can grant like allowing the opening of certain businesses but this can lead to a slippery slope and soon many other businesses will give reasons why they are essential. They cannot process that many requests and people will complain that it is unfair. \n\nThe main role of the government is to implement policies in the interest of the majority.

However, and this is just my opinion, when you are unhappy about a certain thing gahment is implementing, complaining helps definitely. It tells them that whatever they are doing may hv some flaws that can be improved on, but constructive feedback is when ppl will actually think abt giving a shit abt what you are saying. By providing them a suggestion, even if it’s bad, you are already allowing them to think of a possible compromise. By just saying whatever you hv just said, it is just one of the many million complaints abt gahment. And THAT is why they wouldn’t even bat an eyelid abt your complaint. \n\nIt’s... just perspective wise.

If it seems inconsistent, that's probably because we are seeing it only from our own (often skewed) perspective, rather than from that of the government's.\n\nThe messaging is clear - wear masks, observe distancing where possible, don't linger for too long at a particular spot. But life goes on, and it's not going to be possible to manage this everywhere we go, but we try. \n\nFor example, I imagine that the lack of social distancing on public transport is due to the government knowing that there is really no way they are going to be able to enforce it without tons of people showing up late for work. Past a certain point, companies are going to have to chip in by allowing for WFH, rather than mandating that everyone physically show up for work at the company. \n\nThe individual can also decide to find an alternate way to get to work, such as ride-sharing. \n\nSchools opening is a concession because parents won't be able to go back to work without this happening first, and because the government also realises the limitations of HBL. The mentality shouldn't be - oh, if kids can go back to school and meet their friends, why can't I also meet my friends? Rather, it should be - the government is already bending over backwards in doing so, we need to pay back in other areas and not test the system more than we already have.\n\nI know it sucks. I won't dare say whether the government is on the right path or not, but when we consider how many people were arguing for herd immunity (even as Sweden is now admitting that their approach was flawed), it's sometimes hard to criticise the government for decisions made in the fog of war.

If they did, we would not have a phase 1, we will all be sent back to the way our lives were before the entire pandemic. The public transport issue has been indirectly addressed by endorsing the commodity of working from home whenever possible, as it would greatly reduce the amount of people who would be required to take public transport.\n\nAbout the safe-distancing policies schools now have, its effectiveness is once again all banked on students having the sense of responsibility to actually Ensure that they are 1 meter apart from one another. MOE has done whatever they could to Ensure students are actually as safe as possible. E.g alternating HBL, staggered recess timings, staggered dismissal, fixed class sitting arrangements, fixed canteen sitting arrangements, etc.\n\nThese measures would only be effective if Singaporeans went the extra mile to also Ensure that they do their part by keeping a safe distance between one another.

Government tried their best to predict and foresee the future of the shaky and volatile pandemic, CB was actually announced when we only had DOUBLE DIGITS increment of cases everyday. (A lot of you guys here are blaming govt for not closing economy earlier during the jan-mar period resulting in this cluster mess but you have to realise that sg as such a small and open economy, CB can bring huge predicaments to the economy and was best avoided if necessary)\n And as i have said, back then, the increments in cases were not significant, or at least not significant enough for us to have to implement CB. (Plus they implemented it prior to 3 digit increments and breakout of cases so in hindsight i feel they have tried their best to predict it)\n\n2. Reason why govt is not opening services of the same category is because of the increase in flow of people. By allowing one single category, u will have to allow the EVERY SINGLE SHOP operating under that category to open including all outlets and brands. (take bbt shops for instance; if u allow koi to be opened, you have to allow all other bbt shops and all OUTLETS to be opened. That is a extremely significant increase for the flow of people and the govt may just want to minimize that for now) \n\n3. I think governments’ choice in only allowing 2 to visit relatives’ house at a time is also reasonable. While the argument states that you’re sitting beside a stranger during transport, it is unlikely that you will communicate with the stranger, which you will with your relatives, that may result in the spread of the virus. \nSecondly, you have to be sitting for an upwards of 40minutes beside a stranger (both w/o mask) to be at risk of having covid and the possibility of being beside each other for that long is low. Especially when we have just reopened the economy and you practically have no reason to travel far from the west to the east. (Plus any travels from community to cities are only about 40minutes.) \nThirdly, transport can be tracked through systems but your visits to relatives cannot be tracked. No one is able to hold you accountable for where u have been or where u have gone on that specific day. What if there happens to be a breakout of cases that day and you happen to “forget” you have gone to your relatives’ house? That lack of evidence will heavily impair our ability to do contact tracing.\nFourthly, you’re likely to spend hours with your relatives, chat with them, eat with them, all of which you WOULDNT be doing with a stranger on transport, and all these significantly increases the chance for spreading covid compared to a stranger on transport. \n\n4. While it is weird that govt is allowing students to go back to school, you have to take note that there are several measures in place in school as well. Social distancing still applies (for my school at least) and people still have to sit apart from one another. There is now a compulsory need for scanning in and out (so the school knows when you come and leave for school) and there is also tracking in where you sit during lectures. All these point to the fact that whilst it may not b wise to send kids back to school so quickly, they are doing their best to track the flow of people. \n\nJust my 2 cents on this topic, i don’t think any government is able to “perfect” their responses and handling of the pandemic but imo our government has been adapting and changing their policies according to the situations as much as possible. Not that i’m invaliding OP’s argument, i feel that certain points are valid and while true, have an adverse side to consider. It’s not easy to see when you’re only considering your own self benefits (of being able to visit your relatives) but putting and considering everyone together, it actually is a very significant increase in movement (even if not every household chooses to visit their relatives). Think in the perspective of the government and why they chose to implement certain policies, rather than questioning the validity of the policies implemented.

I\'m trying to put myself into their shoes, trying to see how these connect.  Regardless, the TLDR towards a conclusion is that there could be more transparency, especially if there are justifiable reasons behind the apparent contradictions in their approaches.\n\n&gt; 1) Safe-distancing - cannot meet friends because of transmitting and tracking concerns but removing safe-distancing stickers means can sit right next to complete strangers on public transport, which is somehow better than meeting your friends?\n\nPublic transport is an unavoidable necessity towards life here.  Short of forcing public transit to double capacity for a fraction of the ridership, maintaining social distancing here is extremely challenging.\n\nWhen we take transit, we\'re not talking to friends, like we would at a restaurant or some get-together.  It\'s a necessity that you wish to get in and out of ASAP, everyone\'s trying to distance as much as possible.  Which is more likely to be more likely to cause clusters?  It\'s quite possible it\'s the public transit use case.  Which one is unnecessary, though?\n\n&gt; 2) NTUC and budget stores are selling nearly the exact same daily essentials but why only one of them is allowed to be open?\n\nWhich one allows for speedier traceability and ability to enact mitigations as they become necessary?  From a command-and-control perspective, I suspect it would be easier to work with the much smaller number of NTUC stores that already have corporate controls in place to trace and enact changes.\n\nAlso, we know our neighbourhood aunties and uncles, many of us do the friendly chat in a way we would never do with the checkout person at a big chain store.  It\'s in and out, not a social experience.  At least not for me.\n\n&gt; 3) Restaurants are still not allowed to be opened for dining in, even when the safe-distancing was deemed to be more lax (see point 1).\n\nSame point from #1 from me, if someone I know has it, the chances of us contracting it over a 1 hour lunch as we take off our masks to eat, talk, etc, is fairly high.\n\n&gt; 4) Gahmen say beauty and wellness services are not essential so cannot open, but getting a hair dye/perm for hours at your neighbourhood salon is allowed?\n\nThis puzzles me too.  It\'s so weird to me that even in other countries, *this* is the first type of services that get released so people can use them?  Personally IDGAF about my own haircut, but I think it is likely socially important for many people, providing a sense of normalcy and small amount of pampering.\n\nBut yeah.  I don\'t personally know what services should open first, but haircuts...  \n\n&gt; 5) Somehow, candy stores are more essential than budget stores and restaurants since they are allowed to be open and not the other 2.\n\nThis seems odd like #4 to me.  I think these are more in-and-out than the other two, and it\'s less of a concern than the hair-cut piece.  Maybe it\'s the ""you can\'t get bubble tea, but you can get candy"" second-tier replacement?\n\n&gt; 6) Schools are reopened so everybody\'s kids are back together in one location (see point 1 AGAIN) but we are still not allowed to visit our OWN family members. Ironic that any stranger can meet any stranger as long as they are studying in school, but it\'s a big no-no when it comes to our own family members.\n\nThis part makes some more sense to me.  To get back to normality, school is an incredibly key part of how society functions, especially for parents.  From what I understand, children are amongst the least to be affected by the virus.  Also, from a command-and-control perspective, this is quite different from, say, retail outlets, particularly local community shops.  It\'s driven quite literally by hiearchies of responsibilities where any mitigation is much more possible.\n\n&gt; 7) Why are we limited to 2 family members per visit? Visiting family members become visiting ICU ah? My ahboi can meet 39 other kids in school, but I only can see my ahgong ahma 2 by 2 at a time, similj.\n\nI think this falls more into what is a necessity.  It\'s often critical for us to visit our elders because they need the care and even social contact more than others, and often digital options aren\'t truly useful.  To ensure they get the help they need, do we need 4 people visiting?  6? 8?  \n\nI\'m not saying your frustration isn\'t unwarranted.

The vast majority of economies are going through the blue screen of death, and even those that have been barely touched by the virus are still going to suffer from the lack of governmental leadership in the U.S. and countries in Europe on the matter.  We still haven\'t seen the full consequences yet, and I suspect things will get worse because of certain countries that have not gone through the worst of it.\n\nIf cases stayed low, we would still be running the way things used to be.

Taken as a whole, it seems to me like there\'s an intention in minimizing panic and unnecessary pressures on our medical system and the health of the population.  This can result in having decisions look arbitrary.  \n\nBest quick analogy I can think of is around someone who is sick amongst a group of sick friends and the doctor and his team best diagnoses the situation.  Patient looks fine, we\'ll monitor to make sure things are okay, and look things are great, we\'re proud of what\'s going on.  Slowly minor symptoms start showing (infections are slowly rising), we get concerned and start bringing in medication, forcing the patient to rest.  Appendicitis explodes, there\'s a risk it can greatly harm the patient (foreign workers siutation).  Take drastic, fast actions to take care of the situation.  Patient is otherwise fine now, and everyone\'s concerned about ongoing infections, so you keep the patient at rest but allow some people to visit.  You give them some minor freedoms to keep them sane, but they can\'t leave the hospital.\n\nProbably not the best analogy, but I think you can see how some of it connects.

Rather than disagreeing with the policies, it's more of understanding the direction and intent of the policies and providing sound feedback.\n\nI will just give my two cents on what I believe the government's intent and direction is with a few things raised by the post: \n\n&gt;1. Pictures of Minister Khaw removing safe distancing stickers from the MRT certainly do not help. The message that is sent out is inconsistent and often confusing. \n\nCompletely fair and valid point that these pictures of Transport Minister, Khaw Boon Wan, removing safe distancing stickers on Public Transport is sending out an inconsistent message to the general public with regards to safe distancing. \n\nHowever, the crowd on public transport is definitely unavoidable with more people returning to their workplace and students returning to school post Circuit Breaker. More importantly, the onus is on each individual to keep a safe distance with one another to the best of their abilities when on commute.  Yes, the safe distancing stickers on MRT/Buses has been removed, but it's your own choice. You can refrain from sitting down beside a stranger while on commute and standing at a safe distance away from others, yet if you want to take that seat beside the stranger, nobody is stopping you or forcing you to do so. Moreover, the public transport system has resume to full operational capacity, to mitigate the issue of crowding on public transport.   \n\n\n&gt;2.  Supermarkets like NTUC are crowded, and yet budget stores where we get our toothpaste and other essentials are not allowed to open. \n\nSupermarkets allows you to purchase an entire spectrum of essentials all at one place, minimising your travels and reduce the number of places you have to visit to get all your essentials. However, can a budget store do that? Are you able to purchase groceries, along with daily necessities at a budget store? \n\nFurthermore, from a command and control perspective, this is most likely the best possible arrangement. Which do you think is easier to manage, setting up a controlled entry point at supermarkets, or setting up a controlled entry point at each budget store islandwide? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;3. Restaurants still cannot open to diners; beauty and wellness services remain closed. The reason, we are told, is that beauty services are not essential. Yet, on the other hand, people are allowed to spend three hours in a hair salon getting their hair dyed and permed. \n\n* Firstly, based on my experience, I had my mask on throughout my haircut in the hair salon, but I'm not too sure about others. However, can you have your mask on throughout your meal at the diners or beauty and wellness services such as facial/spa or massage. \n* Secondly, the touchpoints at a hair salon is much lower compared to at a diner or beauty and wellness services. You go into a salon, take a seat, tell the stylist what procedures you would like today and just remain seated and go through your procedures. However, at a diner, you need to order your meal, consume your meal which has much more touchpoints.  \n* Last but not least, which will be more shocking, meeting your colleagues and seeing them with a head full of untamed hair and completely white (More senior colleagues) or seeing them with slightly more wrinkles and more pimples here and there.   \n\n\n&gt;4. Schools have reopened. School children are now congregating back at schools. Yet we are not even allowed to see our relatives. I dearly miss my niece and nephew, my auntie, my close friends whom I consider my family. I cannot bear a situation where we are penalized and kept apart even longer because clusters start breaking out from schools and on public transport. Meanwhile, orr parents cannot come to our homes, but we can visit them, 2 at a time. What is the logic in that? And what difference does it make whether it is 2 people or 4 people if we all come from the same household? \n\nI'm sorry for being harsh, but I think it's extremely selfish and foolish of you to think like this. The purpose of relaxing the stance for visiting is to cater to families with elderlies that require assistance and attention of their relatives, for example elderlies with pre-existing health condition, ailments that needs to be addressed. Moreover, which do you think is safer? You, a healthy and fit adult travelling on public transport to visit the elderlies in your family or them who are aging, with their immune system weakening, taking public transport to visit you? Moreover, you are completely missing the point that it's for people who need to assist their elderlies to visit them, not for you just cause you miss your relatives and can't bear to see them for another month when you haven't visit them for the past two months or longer already. \n\nNow touching on the topic of school, if you are someone who has been through the local education system, you will know how packed and tightly planned is our education system. Having a delay that affects the respective milestones of a student will have a cascading effect on their future milestones, which is something the government or the general public do not want. Moreover, with students returning back to school, it also alleviate the care-giving needs of parents to better focus on work to provide the necessary momentum to drive the economy forward. \n\nOn points that I didn't specifically address, I either do not have substantial understanding to address it or I feel it's something that the government is being unclear of in their actions. As a whole, despite the slip up halfway into the crisis where the government reacted to COVID-19 with the same set of protocols as SARS, I feel that the government has done a relatively good job in putting out the fires that has emerged, reducing their impact. Also, adapting rapidly and coming out with necessary procedures to mitigate the impact of the whole outbreak on our country."", '“LANGGAR” with a double g..', ""Some have no choice due to their management wanting them to return despite already WFH during the CB. Boss bad but still need to eat..\n\nSome reported their employers to MOM though, but how enforceable is this if the numbers are huge? I think some will even be recalcitrant to the point of doing it again even after getting fined for it.\n\nIf the mindsets of many management doesn't change, it adds to the toll of the public transport, especially during peak hours."", ""&gt; how do you balance\n\nThe problem now is there is zero balance. It's 100% work and economy. Implementing some policies where people can actually interact outside of their households besides work and school would be a start and shows that the government views us as more than cogs in the economic machinery. \n\nAlso I fail to see how hair salon addresses mental well-being, is visiting a hair salon as good as socialising with people you care about?"", ""On the topic of NTUC, I feel that there is a disconnect between those that came up with the covid measures and what was actually done. \n\nI've worked at two NTUC outlets during this CB period and both differ in their standards in upholding safe distancing. One store does crowd control to perfection because it feels like shopping at midnight hours when it's actually peak hour. The other store only does crowd control when it's crowded. I did crowd control once when the floor was crowded with people still browsing goods, but I got scolded because 'there was no queue at the cashiers'. There is no clear guidelines disseminated to their branches and no proper standards to act on. \n\nNTUC being our national union also has a leadership role to play in the treatment of our workers. They do this by giving staff on their payroll monetary rewards (aka the spotlight award) for this period of time, which is actually commendable. However, this doesn't apply to temp staff because NTUC sources their part timers from recruiting agencies, and hence not on NTUC's payroll and ineligible for the award. So despite NTUC looking towards temp staff to solve manpower issues, they do not get any appreciation at all."", 'It seems to be a major fail in communicating.\n\nIf the government had just said - look, we arbitrarily pick certain sectors to open, and if all ok we open more, it would make more sense.\n\ni.e. we only want 30% of workforce and people moving around so we open up 30% of stuff. Then we open 60% etc.\n\nIf you’re not in the open sector you are sian, but Singaporeans are used to balloting on COE, HDB etc so that could be communicated I think. \n\nIt is why bubble tea etc was closed when the target for people moving around was 15% but we were hovering around 20%.

Was there any strong objections? \n\nAs you said inconsistent message.\n\n__________\n\n\n&gt;Supermarkets allows you to purchase an entire spectrum of essentials all at one place, minimising your travels and reduce the number of places you have to visit to get all your essentials. However, can a budget store do that? Are you able to purchase groceries, along with daily necessities at a budget store? \n\n&gt;Furthermore, from a command and control perspective, this is most likely the best possible arrangement. Which do you think is easier to manage, setting up a controlled entry point at supermarkets, or setting up a controlled entry point at each budget store islandwide? \n\nWhy mamak shop can open but value shop cannot? Whats the difference? Again we can try to guess the reasoning since we dont know. True, can minimise travel and places, but we have more people being confined in the supermarket.

However, can you have your mask on throughout your meal at the diners or beauty and wellness services such as facial/spa or massage. \n\n&gt;Secondly, the touchpoints at a hair salon is much lower compared to at a diner or beauty and wellness services. You go into a salon, take a seat, tell the stylist what procedures you would like today and just remain seated and go through your procedures. However, at a diner, you need to order your meal, consume your meal which has much more touchpoints.\n\n&gt;Last but not least, which will be more shocking, meeting your colleagues and seeing them with a head full of untamed hair and completely white (More senior colleagues) or seeing them with slightly more wrinkles and more pimples here and there.\n\n\nLoL. You are just comparing between 2 things, finding the differences based on the rate of transmission. Now,  what about activities that are banned but follow the same logic with the salon?

Even if only 2 go to visit grandparents, *all 5* in the house will inevitably be exposed before any symptoms present in 5-14 days.\n\nThe *only* reason that could make sense is limiting the number of people on transit who are visiting family.

You\'re just lumping them all under ""non-essential"" and claiming that there is therefore an inconsistency or double standards. But this is not a binary scale; after all they\'re calling it a ""gradual"" reopening. If they followed your advice and let all non-essential businesses open at once then there\'s no way it can be gradual.\n\nIt is possible to come to the conclusion of closing aesthetic clinics but not dessert shops under a consistent standard. I might, for example, just think that the benefit of aesthetic clinics are too minute, and that the patrons tend to be higher income earners anyway who have many other ways of coping with the lockdown. If I think like that, then letting dessert shops open is justifiable since there is likely a larger marginal benefit. \n\nI might also believe that people who sell desserts generally need the revenue more. There are many different standards which are consistent with current policies. You can claim that these have not been fully communicated, but you need a bit more than his little rant to plausibly accuse those in charge of ""inconsistency"" or ""double standards"".\n\n&gt; I don\'t disagree that family visits are trivial or that schools are important to our future generation\'s education.

What is inconsistent about allowing activities deemed to yield greater benefits and not others? Why can they be deemed ""of the same nature"", to the point that allowing one while restricting the other necessarily means there is a double standard? It\'s even more puzzling that you don\'t agree with him on family visits when this is the stance you take.\n\n&gt; You conveniently pull this out of context to form your flimsy argument. The point here wasn\'t about parents or you doing the visit in the first place. You just made one out of thin air and attacked it.\n\nCan you spell out what context I\'m missing? As far as I can tell, he\'s saying it doesn\'t make sense that we can visit our parents but they can\'t visit us. I don\'t see what deeper subtext I\'m missing here when he says ""what is the logic in that?""\n\n&gt; Again, you\'re entirely missing the whole point again. It\'s not even about whether someone is living in the ""same household"". What\'s the point of allowing 2 by 2 visits or 4 or 10? \n\nI was intentionally picking on his use of the word ""household"", because obviously he meant ""family"" which is not the same thing.\n\nAnd given that you are clear about the distinction, it should have been obvious why there is a difference between 2 and 4 and I did not see the need to spell it out.\n\n&gt; If everyone visits the same grandma and unluckily the first guy has COVID and pass it to the grandma, everybody ends up getting it. Why give an arbitrary number of ""2""? I don\'t recall an explanation of the number given, just the government says ""hey, 2 means 2. Take it""\n\nBut if 2 visited in the morning and another 2 visited at night, and the ones who visit at night were positive, at least the ones in the morning don\'t catch the virus. I think you knew this point since you conveniently avoided this in your example by assuming it is the first group who was infected.\n\nIt\'s a very elementary example and I can\'t believe I had to come up with it but there you go.\n\nDo we then really need an explanation for why the number is 2 and not 3 or 4? All we know is that they don\'t want it to be too large. It\'s not bewildering to me that they want to put a cap on the number of people allowed and I don\'t think reasonable people need this explained.\n\nAnd mind you, he was actually implying there was **no difference** between letting 2 people visit and letting 4 people visit. His point was not that 2 was arbitrarily chosen, but that there\'s **no difference**. That\'s indefensible.\n\n&gt; I don\'t know enough about the budget or the affected charities to comment on this.\n\n&gt; What I do know is that you did not read properly enough to formulate any sound argument and arguing for the sake of arguing.\n\nI was arguing exactly my point: that he is basically just ranting about things that happened to him and claiming there is an inconsistency.\n\nHere he is implying that the new scheme is redundant because of the one he applied for before. But obviously it cannot be that not a single charity is eligible for this new scheme right? I don\'t think I have to go very deeply into the details to make my point, and anyway neither does he.', 'Then propose a solution,and stop just talking\n\nAnd what I’m saying is acknowledge the problem,propose a change and volunteer.

You\'re just lumping them all under ""non-essential"" and claiming that there is therefore an inconsistency or double standards...\n\n&gt;.... If I think like that, then letting dessert shops open is justifiable since there is likely a larger marginal benefit.\n\n&gt;I might also believe that people who sell desserts generally need the revenue more. There are many different standards which are consistent with current policies. You can claim that these have not been fully communicated, but you need a bit more than his little rant to plausibly accuse those in charge of ""inconsistency"" or ""double standards"".\n\nFirst of all, I honestly don\'t give a damn about ""aesthetic clinics"" since I never ever use their services. \n\nLet\'s not lump dessert shops and aesthetic clinics then. How about dessert shops and bubble tea shops? One is open but the other one isn\'t.\n\nYou may argue that dessert shops would include home-owners as well as corporations, so does bubble tea. Do bubble tea home-owners do not need the revenue more as well? Is this not inconsistency that you claim you need more of?\n\n&gt;It\'s even more puzzling that you don\'t agree with him on family visits when this is the stance you take.\n\nWhat\'s truly puzzling is that you don\'t know the meaning of ""playing the devil\'s advocate"".

Understandably so, because the hospitals and the healthcare systems will be overwhelmed. He said that in such a scenario \\[high number of infection\\], people with mild symptoms may just have to seek GP's attention and rest at home. The hospitals will then be freed up to treat people with severe symptoms. With low fatality rate, I thought that was a sound strategy especially a brief research on SARs informed me that 2 doctors had died fighting the virus in 2003. So far and fortunately, there was no fatality among any of our healthcare fighters. Facts seem to suggest that covid is highly infectious but less lethal. \n\nWith the so-called lifting of CCB, the feeling of still being in the state of lockdown persists. Essentially, the economy is still closed and being prop up by the various govt's scheme. At what cost?  Close to 100b. How long can we sustain all these? For once, govt is paying some employers up to 75% of their workers' pay, up from 25% and up to 4.6k. Imagine, govt is paying 3.45k of a worker's 4.6k monthly salary. All in the hope that the workers will get to keep the job. However, if the economy remain in closed state, no employers will keep the workers as they still have to pay 25% of the salary to workers while the businesses generate zero revenue. Workers' salary is only one component of business cost and if the  lockdown continue and economy remain closed, sooner or later, businesses still have to let their workers go. In fact, it is already happening as evidenced by increasing closures of F&amp;B businesses. Banyan Tree just lay off 180 of their workforce today. \n\nI think govt should open up the economy fast.

The point of extension is to (almost) stop community spread once and for all.\n\nThis virus is very nasty in a way. Its insidious and silent. Asymptomatic spread is a very big issue. What is caught by testing is only the tip of the iceberg, although no one can know for sure how big the rest of the iceberg is.\n\nCommon sense will tell us that if there are still asymptomatic cases floating around, they will go on to spread to others when we end the CB measures. The more asymptomatic case we leave behind with a half-hearted CB, the faster we are on our way to the second wave. Likewise, if there’s no (or very little) asymptomatic cases left hidden in the community, it will be easier to manage and trace and to limit the spread, preventing a second wave.\n\nIt is difficult to predict how fast it will rise or fall, that’s why no one can say for sure that one month will be enough. Depending on the situation, extension is needed.\n\nWhat people also need to understand is this, you want your freedom to roam, meet, etc, everyone can understand. But the faster we rush things, the riskier it becomes. You don’t want us to shoot ourselves in the foot, by haphazardly opening up so that people would be satisfied, only to be forced back into a CB because of that. It makes the sacrifice of the first CB go down the drain, and I’m sure no one but the most selfish would want that to happen, right?\n\nExtra: also if anyone thinking that since we are wearing masks and doing “social distancing”, we will be fine, then remember that before CB started, we were also forced to wear masks and social distance and that didn’t stop the spread.

You are still allowed to shop for essentials or take public transport if you are working in essential industries. Some people even openly flouted it and go for *handjobs* in condos. What this mean is that there are people who are still in contact with others to spread the virus. However, for most people who adhere to the spirit of the CB and otherwise stayed at home, no contact no spread applies.\n\nAs compared to no CB at all, the reduced contact naturally cut down on a lot of potential avenues of asymptomatic hidden community spread.', ""If your implementation isnt sound, then the cb isnt sound.

The number of actual deaths in Japan is far higher than reported, based on the amount of excess death. Certain sources said something about it being 10x more than reported for the initial month alone (that wasn’t even about the peak yet), if I remembered clearly.\n\nTaiwan fought well because the Taiwanese government was inherently suspicious of China. Their close cultural links also meant that certain doctors in Wuhan could leak and inform them of the existence of COVID in advance. The Taiwanese was the first to impose immigration control on people from China, even before WHO made any recommendations. They controlled COVID because they made sure they are airtight. That coupled with masks, social responsibility (something we lacked sometimes), aggressive tracing, and less dense population saved them.\n\nWe cannot repeat Taiwan’s miracle story because it’s too late. The virus is in our country already. Had we achieved the goal of the CB and achieved stable 0 cases, maybe, we could implement Taiwan’s strategy to prevent a second wave.\n\nSouth Korea took the mass testing route with high tech aggressive contact tracing. As I had mentioned earlier we can forget about doing what they did, since we do not have the capacity to even mass test the dorm cases. Neither do we have the infrastructure or resource in place to do very aggressive contact tracing, at least not yet so far. They need to distribute the ankle monitor first.\n\nThe thing about public health measure and economy is that it is not a matter of “either or”. It is not either economy die or people die. It is a matter of balance. This virus can maim and kill, and if it kills and maim too much, it will cause lasting damage to the economy also. Saving the economy does not mean people must die, as government has enough funds to tide the economy through in the short term, allowing short term measures to be imposed to keep things under control. That is why if we have limited time, we have to do a good job. Don’t do a half-hearted job and then shoot ourselves in the foot, because the more we do that, the worse it is to the economy.\n\nFurthermore, there are signs that COVID is triggering an unprecedented global economic crisis, and we, being so dependent on external trade, would never be able to avoid it entirely. Even if we sacrifice people for the economy, there is no guarantee the economy will hold, since if the world goes down in flame, we will do so too.

They're hurting from domestic policies not the global economy\n\nAnd your argument about doing a half hearted job is moot. We already did the cb, you knew it had loopholes.

The government knows the new batch of graduates are *extra fucked* and they funded #sgunitedtraineeship for that purpose, although its effectiveness remains to be seen.\n\nGovernment funding is a very powerful thing. The government has enough in its reserves that it is a few times over the annual GDP.

The reason is very simple. Those who died at home before they could go to the hospital, or those who died before they could be tested, are all not counted as COVID deaths. But, they are caused by COVID.\n\nBy measuring excess deaths, you will get the actual scale of the death toll from COVID. Reporting is not perfect. \n\nJust like how our cases today is limited because of testing capacity. Does that mean we lied or underreport on the actual scale?

But, by subsidising the businesses, we can hope to keep them alive until the end of this pandemic. Business revenues will plunge but that’s not the main concern, the main concern is to prevent collapse and mass layoff, which government funding can try to alleviate.\n\nGDP is a measure of every activity in the economy. It counts everything, including the profits.

This didn’t include them also.\n\nWhatever it is, the Japanese clearly had paid for their tardiness with lives.\n\nThe point is, Japan’s strategy was slow, late, and wasn’t very well received. Other countries with tardy responses or limited response have proven well enough that it is an utter mistake. The Swedish chose “herd immunity” against lockdowns, and recently their government officials came out regretting the amount of deaths their policies had caused. The UK backstepped on their “herd immunity” policy also. The “herd immunity” policy is basically not doing anything, and in every country it had been trialled, it is a tragedy. \n\nJapan slow response initially would have mimicked that, and the outcome should not be miraculously different. Furthermore, Japan was also widely accused of downplaying the situation and response in hopes of continuing with the Summer Olympics.\n\nI do not believe that Japan is a worthwhile example for Singapore to mimic.

They need to find this sweet spot, the equilibrium.\n\nI’m also guessing that with investment into that location tracing device and possibly upgrading their testing facilities, they can transition out of CB restrictions to this new measures. But, we are not at that stage yet, so it makes absolutely no sense to just end CB, since the number of people who will get COVID = (the number of people with COVID in the community) x (how many others can they spread to) + (leaked cases from dorms, imported cases, other miscellaneous sources).\n\n*The restrictions are the only reason why it is kept low. The moment you end it, it will go up.*\n\n&gt;\tAnother point, since the fatality rate is not high, what if all the resources on lockdown, support schemes here and there all channel into healthcare instead? All the social distancing ambassadors can become swabbers or nursing assistants like SIA girls?\n\nThe fatality rate is not high precisely because we kept it under control. At no point did our healthcare system get overwhelmed. At no point did we need to ration ventilators like Italy. At no point did our doctors need to choose who to *die*. That will change is the cases get out of control. \n\nDon’t forget we are too population dense. Once it spread, it can spread like wildfire and we will get overwhelmed before we know it.\n\nAlso about the swabber thing, these days we always get low amount of cases because of limited testing capacity. It doesn’t take long to shove a stick up someone’s nose, but it takes time to do PCR and prepare the samples and reagents. The SIA people, unfortunately, cannot be expected to do complicated lab work.', 'The name circuit breaker suggest its goal. It is to circuit break the community transmission. They have communicated it before, where PM Lee mentioned about achieving as close to zero cases as possible. This is the goal.\n\nImplementation wise, I don’t think I am satisfied with it too. I felt we did a half-assed job, giving too many loopholes and being too lenient with it. The inconsistent rules and suggestions also doesn’t help.\n\nThe goal is as low or stable low cases. The*end date* is not the goal. Recall long time ago in secondary school science lab, recall something about a chemical reaction, with burettes and flasks and pH colour-changing indicators. CB can be likened to that. We want to reach the sweet spot, the colour change. When we first announce that one month, we are announcing something like in agar agar 30s we will get the colour change, which is somewhat arbitrary since you can’t tell for sure. Now we reached the dripping step and we keep thinking, just another drop, just another drop, but it didn’t change colour! 30s become 35s become 40s, and so on. \n\n*Let me ask you, did we changed the goal post? We said 30s we will be done but now its 45s! We are getting impatient.* But, if we get angry because the time taken had been repeatedly extended, we have forgotten what our real goal is. Our goal is not the time taken. Our goal is the end result. You can make educated guess and give ETAs, but ETAs are ETAs, an estimation. They are not the goal, and they never will be.', 'Here is my interpretation. You are free to interpret in your own manner.\n\nThe number of people who will get COVID = (the number of people lurking in the community that can spread COVID) x (how many people each lurking case can spread to) + (leakage from all other sources like dorm/import/etc).\n\nWhat CB targets is the *how many people each lurking case can spread to* part of the equation. The CB measure itself keeps this component of the equation in balance.\n\nNow, given our cases have not gone to zero and the government seemed to be content with stable low cases, we need to understand what this mean in keeping *how many people each lurking case can spread to* stable.\n\nCB keeps that component less than 1, making cases decline. However, economically and politically, it isn’t feasible.\n\nBut, we can’t immediately remove CB, because we know before CB, masks and social distancing alone cannot stop the case from rising. You want cases to be stable you aim to keep that component as close to 1. Keeping it below 1 with CB is too expensive, but not doing anything will make it shoot way up above 1, giving rise to a second wave.\n\nWhat gradual reopening does is to slowly titrate that part of the equation to 1. No one can tell for sure what measures must be retained and what can be lifted, that’s why it’s a cautious titration and not an immediate lifting.\n\n&gt;\tWe had had 20-30 people die here. This is not a massive number. Open the damn country up again in some way and deal with the fact a few coffin dodgers will be curling their toes up a month or two ‘before their time’.\n\nThe only reason we had so little death is because *we are not overwhelmed*. We didn’t have to *ration the ventilators*, we didn’t have to *force medical students who haven’t even graduate up to the frontlines*, our doctors *never had to choose who to die like in Italy*. That is why our numbers are so low. Because we weren’t overwhelmed. \n\nWe are a population dense country. Facing a social virus, a lax response will let it spread like wildfire, threatening to overwhelm the healthcare system and risk killing people who would otherwise had survived.\n\nYoung people can die. The famous Wuhan doctor who whistleblowed wasn’t a month or two before their time. When Italian doctors had to set a cut off age to using ventilators at 60, those low-sixties aren’t months from their coffin either.\n\nAnd if you think just because someone is 60 they are not important economically, think again. They play their role in many ways, such as looking after grandchildren so that more working age adults are not forced to be homebound. They spend and consume like anyone else, making them an important component of the consumer base. Killing even the silver-haired is to permanently damage the economy to a certain extent.', ""Because its impossible in grocery stores, they are cramped. Unless they limit the number of people allowed in at once it's inevitable."", ""It's virtually impossible to do safe distancing in supermarkets......At least everyone's wearing a mask that is also important to protect ourselves and protect others as well"", 'We are not overwhelmed and we have never been close to being so. Being cautious is no bad thing. But remaining so long after you’ve wrecked the economy is.', 'The reason the cases didn’t explode and we get overwhelmed is because measures are put in place to keep it from getting that bad.\n\nRemoving it all at once will only make things worsen rapidly. The virus don’t care about momentum. COVID is not going to say, hey, since you stopped me for 2 months, I will continue to decline even if you resume everything. COVID is not a living thing, it doesn’t think, it has no sympathy. It will exploit every hole we give it.\n\nSingapore is naturally unfavourable due to our highly dense population. It makes it even more challenging to stop this social virus. We cannot be complacent or lax, as we don’t have huge open space as natural social distancing. If we are only as densely populated as New Zealand, sure thing, let’s resume everything after CB with masks and social distancing. \n\nUnfortunately, we are not. I recall reports of studies showing how masks isn’t leakproof, how virus can still leak and escape. This wouldn’t be a problem if our MRT, buses, supermarkets, and whatever aren’t packed like sardines. Because we are packed like sardines, we are even more vulnerable.\n\nWrecking the economy isn’t a black or white thing. Let’s say today we follow your suggestion and relax all measures to pre-CB conditions, what now? It is proven that those pre-CB conditions alone is not sufficient, the proof being the pre-CB measures was ineffective to prevent a CB anyway.\n\nIf we know it will cause a second wave, what do you think the government will do? Do you think PAP will be reckless and follow the lead of that Brazillian president Bolsnaro to ignore the virus? The government will never do that. The government will be forced to reimpose CB. We will waste the effort now plus we have to tolerate all that again! *How is that any better to the economy?*\n\nInstead of a 2 month CB with 1 month taper, and hopefully we can keep it in control in addition to the enhanced contact tracing/testing capacity, we do what you suggest. What will then be likely to happen is that we get 2 months CB, 1 month free, 2 more months of CB, and again? How is that *good* for the economy? Instead of having a 2 months of servere disruption and 1 month of moderate disruption, we get 4 or more months of severe disruption to work and businesses.\n\nI don’t know where you get the idea that economy and public health is mutually exclusive. Nothing is black or white in this world. Those that think its black or white invented the *most inhumane and disrespectful way to combat the pandemic, the “highly regarded” strategy of herd immunity, since imposing any measure will hurt the economy, then we shall do nothing at all.* There is no one country that had proven that herd immunity/doing nothing strategy is beneficial, since it causes way more death and not much economic benefit.', 'The issue is not so much enforcement by outlet or authorities but a fundamental mindset change on the part of shoppers (make that.. all of us) to be gracious and give way - wait for your turn, don’t rush, “saving yourself time may actually harm those around you” ... I think someone should come out with a campaign to instil these values &amp; raise awareness that we are living in a new normal....']"

We do not want to have to hit the circuit breaker again,” said Khaw.\n\n&gt; From Tuesday, Phase 1 of Singapore’s re-opening will see businesses in sectors deemed at low risk of COVID-19 transmission being allowed to resume operations.

his post is too long to post in whole. read his whole fb post first before commenting  

&gt; Summary

&gt; Boys and girls, to conclude, I would like to summarize for you the key lessons that I would like you to remember:

&gt; (a) Data has context. It’s not simply a matter of how many infected cases a country reports. You need to understand where the data comes from and how it is obtained. The capacity limits for COVID testing means that we need to be wary about believing the data and it is not because anyone is intentionally under-reporting.

&gt; (b) Don’t just believe what people tell you. Just because people tell you that if the dorms were better everything would be ok, you don’t just believe them. You ask why should it be? Don’t just take at face value. Just because someone has a PhD, don’t just believe him. Heck, don’t even believe me. Derive everything again by yourself from first principles.

&gt; (c) Learn to use imagination and do thought experiments. Someone tells you, if you only  listened to me and did this, everything will be good. Well, you just happily imagine that they were right and ask yourself, then what? The problem with these big mouths who talk a lot is that they just shoot off their mouths. They have no accountability to actually do anything. They have no sense of perspective, no sense of the costs and no sense of the practical constraints.

&gt; (d) Have a sense of perspective. We are not the only country to have massive numbers of foreign or migrant workers. I don’t believe that the living conditions of our foreigner workers are the worst in the world. Other countries have no COVID infections in their dorms or dorm-equivalents we think? Are people so naive? Note that as far as I know, we are the *only* country, where the PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers. To tell them, not worry, Singapore will take care of them. Think about that for a moment. 

&gt; (e) School v Real Life. My complaint about school is that it often misleads our students into thinking that every problem has a model  answer. Not true in life. There are situations where you know that sh*t is going to hit the fan and yet all you can do is to feel sorry for yourself while it happens in slomo. COVID19 is one such moment for Singapore. In times like this, we suck it up and wait to clean up after the mess is over. 

&gt; On this note, all please be good. Stay home and stay safe! If you need to go out, observe safe distancing and wash your hands regularly.",singapore,237544,Ben Leong: Teaching Moments from Fighting COVID19,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gq3kdq/ben_leong_teaching_moments_from_fighting_covid19/,"['Deriving from first principles, huh?

Lobbyists are gonna be working hard again.\n\n&gt;Suppose the Government has just listened to these NGOs. Every single one of these foreigner workers had their own single rooms with attached bathroom and sauna. Best in Singapore and Batam also. We throw in a cleaning auntie to do area cleaning for them and do their laundry. Just imagine that. \n\n\n&gt; Do we believe that it would have allowed us to avoid the current problem with the foreign worker dorms? \nObviously, this would increase social distancing and *maybe* help somewhat. **But guess what? The workers will still be eating together and working together.  Do people  understand how infectious this virus is? Even healthcare workers in full PPE can still catch it. Confirm will still kenna.

Plain and simple.**\n\n\nThe below part is very true. But up for yourself to judge.\n\n\n&gt;Why are we misled into thinking that it would help? Because our brains are lazy. We want easy solutions. Part of it is also the Government’s fault. The Government didn’t offer us any reason for how and why the situation imploded in the dorm. Given the lack of an alternative, people just accept what is offered, hook, line and sinker. \n&gt;\n**I think it’s despicable for these groups to try to use this crisis to advance their lobbying.

One is the problem specific to COVID, which is that no special measures were taken to properly social distance the workers and ensure that adequate hygiene protocols were put into place. In my opinion, the government really dropped the ball on this one - they were quick to implement such policies for schools but did not foresee the same issue for dorms. This is what NGOs alerted them to at the onset of the crisis. However, they still failed to act on time, which is unforgivable in my eyes.\n\nSecondly, there\'s a more wide ranging issue of poor conditions in dorms. This is what NGOs have been campaigning the government for years, but conditions remain poor. Nobody is asking for 5 star hotel accomodation for foreign workers, despite whatever strawman Ben Leong cooked up. However, it is undeniable that conditions are poor and fail to meet international standards. This is an issue which is only tangentially related to the dorm infections, but has been brought under the spotlight due to the infections, and rightfully so.\n\nNobody expects 0 migrant worker infections. But how can anyone in good conscience look at the 20,000+ infections we have now, shrug their shoulders, and say ""nothing could be done""? Much of this could be avoided, and it wasn\'t.', ""Oh alright, I kinda get what you mean.\n\nHis point here is to use your basic instincts to figure out the validity (ie someone making sense) of each arguments presented, not really about the legality. \n\nFor example, the point he mentioned was 'if the dorms were better (of the conditions) the situation be better'. In this case, to evaluate if the argument is valid, draw on your own experiences, instincts to see if the situation is dependent on living conditions.\n\nIf you have lived in a clean environment but still got sick easily (or lived in a dirty environment but never got sick much) then your basis is that the covid situation in dorms is not necessarily dependent on living conditions.\n\nIf you have lived in a clean environment and never got sick much and then lived in a dirty environment and got sick frequently, pr vice versa, then your basis is that the covid situation in dorms is very likely linked to living conditions.\n\nThese examples and analysis show that basic instincts may not encroach into the issues of legality. \n\nBasic instincts don't always have to mean a right or wrong, but more on what makes more sense to the person thinking. It can be right from Person A's POV, but wrong from Person B's POV. \n\nMany things as derived from first principles is relative, and legality also."", ""Smart guy, he wrote a post that can easily be interpreted the way the reader wants to see it.

I think this is untrue, and it seems like he is trying to shirk some responsibilities of the G.\n\nI think a combination of better dorm conditions+enforcing social distancing among FWs (eg. during meals)+better personal hygiene (mask usage etc) would have helped dramatically."", ""I think your point 1 was covered by BL in his original fb post. Where it was cited that it was logistically tough to come up with temporary dorms. By the time it was set up, it was also when they found out there plenty of of asymptomatic spreaders and spreading already started. [let me know if I got the sequence wrongly]\n\nOn to point 2, I have always asked for research on foreign workers working conditions in other countries. We always say foreign workers conditions are poor in SG, what's the standards are we comparing to? When you say international standards, can you share with me some sources to this international standards? It is created by WTO? Or WHO? \n\nAs to your last paragraph, I don't think that is what BL expressed but he pointed out that under the extereme stress and short time frame for decision-making, it is often easy to get it wrong.

That was settled with military precision. People think about it. You might know that the foreign worker dorms are a risk, but if you get a case and it was handled quite easily, you would naturally think that the risk was manageable.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;My hypothesis is that the real root cause for the foreign dorm infections was the humongous number of asymptomatic cases. To be fair, we always had this suspicion that there could be a small number of asymptomatic carriers. That the [proportion could be up to 96(!)](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/us-state-prisons-inmates-test-positive-for-12677334?fbclid=IwAR3Q_pcndnopRPYZ62HymxyKe5LWoFJ2s8hAB1HvJFUNJgCzQNPXCO_zk70)% was not apparent until after we had imposed the CB. By then, it was too late.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Why is it so hard for us and anyone to detect this earlier? Well, for the  simple reason that there was a limited testing capacity.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;If you had to choose who to test, would you choose the ones who look sick or the ones who look perfectly normal. This massive problem was likely detected when one dorm got hit and they did systematic testing in the dorms."", ""I shall reproduce Ben Leong's full post below for your reading convenience, since OP only posted the summary.\n\n&gt;I hope everyone is doing well. This past Semester has been quite a harrowing one and being cooped up at home for so long is making me really edgy. I am writing this note because I found one of my students sharing this note by one Dr Tan Meng Wah, with the comment “Good read.” I read, and I was horrified that my student thought it was a good read. \n \n&gt;I think it’s drivel and I am well-aware of the Streisand Effect, but still I would encourage everyone to read it, before reading what I have to say.

Ordinarily, I wouldn’t bother to defend the Government, because I am not paid enough to do that. But these are not ordinary times. We don’t have enough reasonable voices saying reasonable things. We need more sense making during this time of confusion and anxiety. For this reason, I thought I better step up and say something. Earlier, I was also too swamped with work and e-exams.\n \n&gt;3. Declaration of potential conflict of interest: I am currently tangentially involved in the nation’s COVID19 efforts. SAF has been activated. SAF approached me because I have certain specialized skills and I am now effectively the commander of a small group of literally “keyboard warriors” supporting SAF, to support MOH in our (manual) contact tracing processes. The reason why I am declaring this is not because I want to pretend to be some kind of hero. We are not. My students and I are playing a v v small and insignificant part. All credit goes to the real frontliners who are wearing PPE fighting the virus daily. I am declaring this because if I don’t, and some kaypoh learns about this later, I will get accused of being some kind of PAP mole sent by the COVID Taskforce to do PR. Such is the perilous nature of the internet this days. Do good also scared people find out. Allow me to make clear that my team and I are the grunts. We don’t get anywhere close to dunno what Ministerial Task Force. I want to clarify that I have had no access whatsoever to any kind of privileged information and everything that I will be talking about in this post comes from information that is publicly available online.\n \n&gt;**Let’s Role-Play MTF**\n \n&gt;Dr Tan wrote a lot of the usual opposition drivel about how the Government is bad and the PAP is incompetent. I am not going to be bothered to address those. I am not sure that there’s anything new there and the Government can jolly well deal with it when they are done fighting COVID. Not my problem. I will keep my analysis to COVID19 related issues. \n \n&gt;To better understand the crisis and how to deal with the crisis, let’s pretend for a moment that we’re the Ministerial Task Force (MTF) for COVID19.\n \n&gt;It is now Jan 2020. Wuhan is burning and it is in lockdown. We know that this is going to be a problem. We don’t know what we are dealing with exactly. We kiasi, quickly ban Wuhan, then we ban China and we form this dunno what MTF. \n \n&gt;We don’t know what’s happening yet because the Chinese are too busy keeping their people from dying and studies have not been done. What do we assume? At this point, there are 2 choices: (i) we assume it’s going to kill us like SARS; and (ii) we can go with POTUS that this is just a “Chinese flu”. \n \n&gt;We’re Singaporeans. Don’t be ridiculous. Of course we kiasi and assume SARS. We open the drawer and take out SARS SOP and execute. \n \n&gt;Singapore’s ability to execute SOP is breath-taking. Clearly, if COVID19 were SARS, COVID19 would have been wiped out many times over. \n \n&gt;To be fair, our initial execution was flawless. We were proclaimed the world’s Gold standard. So far, so good. \n \n&gt;**To Mask or Not to Mask, That is the Question**\n \n&gt;This is where a lot of self-proclaimed geniuses will tell you that the Government had failed when it told the population that they didn’t have to wear masks and then had to U-turn. 4 doctors had come out to say that they advocated the wearing of masks in Feb 2020. Why didn’t the Government listen? \n \n&gt;This is where I will take a short break to scold the Government for saying that no need to wear masks because “masks not required.” Siao. You tell my grandma that it’s not effective my grandma also won’t believe you. How can be not effective? If not effective, the medical personnel wear masks for what? To look good ah?\n \n&gt;Hold that thought.\n \n&gt;At the same time, there are also complaints that supply of masks running out. People complain cannot buy masks. \n \n&gt;People don’t know this *that* time, but we later know because of Madam Ho, what happened at the same time was that while ST had a N95 factory line and were ready to ship masks back to Singapore, Taiwan had banned us from exporting the masks back to Singapore? Do we announce this to the public so that we can all be pissed at Taiwan together? No cannot. Must diam diam. We announce this, we will create panic*. \n \n&gt; \\*For now, all don’t panic and worry about masks -- confirm got enough: https://www.thinkchina.sg/china-will-have-too-many-mask-making-factories. Quality might be a problem but the supply is there. \n \n&gt;Let’s come back to this question: should we make it compulsory to wear masks? This question needs to be answered at 2 levels\n\n&gt;(i) Suppose we did make it compulsory to wear masks, and remember, this was pre-CB, so everyone is out as per normal. That means we will burn ~5 million masks a day. Dr Tan talks so much. Where is he and all the others who talk a lot going to cough up the masks? Talk is cheap hor. Keep in mind that our “supposed” friends are screwing us over and we don’t dare to announce publicly. If people want to know why we didn’t stockpile 5 million x 365 days worth of masks, don’t have to put up PQ, I tell you. SARS SOP didn’t need that. So yes, the PAP Government was not omniscient enough to know we will have COVID19 this year. Damn lousy lah. People should vote Dr Tan in next GE. He is clearly omniscient. Did anyone calculate how much 5 million x 365 days worth of masks would have cost us if COVID19 didn’t happen? \n \n&gt;(ii) For the second level, did we *really* think we need to make everyone wear masks? It might be surprising that this is even a question, but it is -- and this is what separates the people who actually learnt something about probability in school and those who only know how to answer exam questions. \n \n&gt;This is Jan-Feb 2020. Singapore has activated the world’s most efficient contact tracing system. Every single infected one we catch, we send to NCID. All their friends kenna quarantined. It seemed to work. That’s why we’re the gold standard. What does that mean? That means that even though we know there are likely some infected people that we haven’t yet identified and caught, we don’t expect them to be many. Conservatively, let’s say 100. With hindsight, that’s maybe too small, but at *that* point, that’s as good as it gets.\n \n&gt;What is 100? Roughly, that’s probably the number of MediaCorp actors and actresses we have? I suspect MediaCorp has more. How often do you get to meet Zoe Tay or Fann Wong? I have never seen them in person in my life. \n \n&gt;Note that you can only catch COVID from someone who has been infected. If there are only 100 of them running around, your probability of getting hemorrhoids is likely higher. \n \n&gt;Let’s use an army analogy to make the situation more obvious. The masks are like bullets. If you are not likely to meet the enemy, you shoot the bullets for what? Conserve bullets when when they are needed and only the people likely to meet the enemy, i.e. firstline healthcare workers, should wear masks loh. \n \n&gt;In other words, not wearing masks was the correct and most logical choice at that point. What other choice do people think we have? All wear masks, masks come from where? Dr Tan refers to this situation as a political consideration. Not enough masks is not enough masks simi sai political situation? Dr Tan and his 4 doctors can supply ah? \n \n&gt;Basically, on the mask wearing issue, the Government did get the answer right (it was judged both impractical and of not urgent need), but got the working wrong, so kenna marked wrong. \n \n&gt;Dr Tan mentioned that “To solve the shortage problem, the Government approached 400 suppliers in about 20 countries to buy more masks. At the same time, volunteers and female inmates from the Correctional Services were mobilized to help boost production of masks to 90,000 a day or 2.5 million masks a month.” \n \n&gt;Implication is what? Singapore Government sleeping on the job and never go and try to buy masks? Well, what’s that ugly that looks like a bra, but not quite, in our house now? Dr Tan provide one or Hong Kong government procure for us he thinks? \n\n&gt;But the story does not end there....."", '&gt;**On Testing and COVID numbers**\n \n&gt;But, before we go to the second part of this COVID saga, let’s take a brief intermission and talk about COVID numbers. I think that it’s v important for our students to learn about how to look at numbers and make sense of numbers. We have a Quantitative Reasoning (QR) module at NUS. I hope the instructors covered this example in class already. \n \n&gt;First, the numbers are all wrong. It was obvious that the numbers coming out of China were all wrong. China was accused of under-reporting and lying about the seriousness of the situation. In fact, the chart coming out of China was surprisingly linear. Confirm fake lah!\n \n&gt;Let me tell you this. If we look at the numbers coming out of the US, I can tell you almost certainty that the numbers are also under-reported. Confirm wrong. US also under-reporting and lying about their numbers? \n \n&gt;So, what’s the moral of the story? Everybody lies? \n \n&gt;As it turns out, there one big choke point that few people have talked about -- that’s testing. This COVID test is not some pregnancy test. You don’t happily go out to Watsons and buy one. Good for Korea for nailing this and really ramping up the tests. But most countries struggle, including us. \n \n&gt;There are limits to how many tests can be conducted and processed. In fact, when we say that linear looking thing coming out of China, we were likely seeing the testing capacity rather than the actual number of cases. \n \n&gt;So how do we make sense out of this lack of data? We look at the death rates. We take the country with the lowest death rate. I suspect it’s Singapore, but people can check. We’re at 0.075%. Basically out of every 10,000 infected, about 8 die. \n \n&gt;Let’s look at the US. They claim to have 1.65 million cases. They currently have a death rate 6%. That’s a hundred times higher than Singapore(!).\n \n&gt;While we might believe that we have a better healthcare system in Singapore. Do we believe that we are 100x better? Not possible, so what we can do is to conservatively assume that their healthcare systems are overwhelmed and 2 to 3 times worse, so it might be reasonable to assume that their actual effective death rate should be say 0.2%. \n \n&gt;What this suggests is that the situation in the US could potentially be 30x worse that what is officially reported. With the same approach, I had estimated the total number of cases in Wuhan was likely in the 300,000 range, when it was reported to be ~60,000. \n \n&gt;The reader is encouraged to apply this simple methodology to get a sense of how bad things are in other countries. Generally, it’s probably /*much/* worse than what’s reported.\n\n&gt;**How and Why did Sh*t Hit the Fan?**\n \n&gt;It was all fine and dandy. We were all having our bubble tea, as the world went into chaos. Then what happened?\n \n&gt;The methodology I used above is not rocket science. It would also be obvious to the MTF that things were rapidly going south overseas. What did we do? \n \n&gt;We activated MFA and started evacuating our people from overseas. All our students on exchanged were recalled. Many were complaining. \n \n&gt;As it turned out, many of these returnees were infected and we were not able to control the second wave, leading to the Circuit Breaker. \n \n&gt;Was it a mistake to evacuate them? \n \n&gt;I am glad that nobody suggested that we made a mistake in recalling our citizens. My view: We had no choice. We need to take care of our own. \n \n&gt;The bigger problem obviously are the foreign worker dorms. I am surprised that Dr Tan did not say anything about this and we went on and on this usual meaningless tirade against the Government that nobody probably cares to read. Nevermind, I do the job for him. \n \n&gt;Let’s talk about the foreign worker dorms.\n \n&gt;We have always had these NGOs, activists, dunno what, clamoring about improving conditions in the dorms, whatever lah. Generally, my impression was that we just have bunch of bleeding hearts trying to do. Good for them. Good for us. I mind my own business.\n \n&gt;However, we now have this on-going narrative, that Government was completely at fault. If only the Government had listened to them and improved the conditions for the dorms, we wouldn’t have these massive numbers of infections in the dorms. \n \n&gt;How many people believe this? Hands up. \n \n&gt;Very good. Put your hand down. \n \n&gt;Boys and girls, let talk about how to reason about this claim.\n \n&gt;Suppose the Government has just listened to these NGOs. Every single one of these foreigner workers had their own single rooms with attached bathroom and sauna. Best in Singapore and Batam also. We throw in a cleaning auntie to do area cleaning for them and do their laundry. Just imagine that. \n \n&gt;Do we believe that it would have allowed us to avoid the current problem with the foreign worker dorms? \n \n&gt;Obviously, this would increase social distancing and *maybe* help somewhat. But guess what? The workers will still be eating together and working together. Do people understand how infectious this virus is? Even healthcare workers in full PPE can still catch it. Confirm will still kenna. Who are we kidding?\n \n&gt;Keep in mind that we would not be requiring them to wear masks -- because our own people were not asked to wear masks then. You want to discriminate against these foreign workers? \n \n&gt;My point: all these claims that acceding to the earlier demands of these NGOs and activists would have allowed us to avoid the current foreigner worker COVID situation is hogwash. Plain and simple. \n \n&gt;Why are we misled into thinking that it would help? Because our brains are lazy. We want easy solutions. Part of it is also the Government’s fault. The Government didn’t offer us any reason for how and why the situation imploded in the dorm. Given the lack of an alternative, people just accept what is offered, hook, line and sinker. \n \n&gt;I think it’s despicable for these groups to try to use this crisis to advance their lobbying. This is not the time. People also please don’t repeat stupid sh*t that you hear just because people say them. Use your brain to think about whether it makes sense. \n\n&gt;There is a bunch of geniuses who say that if only we didn’t have any foreigner workers, there would not be any dorms and so there would be no foreign worker dorm problem. That statement is actually completely true. I shall leave it as an exercise for the reader to analyze the feasibility and helpfulness of that suggestion. \n \n&gt;**Root Cause of Foreign Dorm Infections**\n \n&gt;Keep in mind that we actually did have one foreign worker dorm incident even in the first wave. That was settled with military precision. People think about it. You might know that the foreign worker dorms are a risk, but if you get a case and it was handled quite easily, you would naturally think that the risk was manageable. \n \n&gt;My hypothesis is that the real root cause for the foreign dorm infections was the humongous number of asymptomatic cases. To be fair, we always had this suspicion that there could be a small number of asymptomatic carriers. That the proportion could be up to 96(!)% was not apparent until after we had imposed the CB. By then, it was too late. \n \n&gt;Why is it so hard for us and anyone to detect this earlier? Well, for the simple reason that there was a limited testing capacity. \n \n&gt;If you had to choose who to test, would you choose the ones who look sick or the ones who look perfectly normal. This massive problem was likely detected when one dorm got hit and they did systematic testing in the dorms.\n \n&gt;Maybe some people expect a Government that is more omniscient. They certainly have the option to vote in a more omniscient Government at the next GE. Our Tans seem to be pretty omniscient.  :-)\n \n&gt;Personally, I would be more circumspect and forgiving about the challenges of dealing with this enemy unseen.', '&gt;**Summary**\n \n&gt;Boys and girls, to conclude, I would like to summarize for you the key lessons that I would like you to remember:\n \n&gt;(a) Data has context. It’s not simply a matter of how many infected cases a country reports. You need to understand where the data comes from and how it is obtained. The capacity limits for COVID testing means that we need to be wary about believing the data and it is not because anyone is intentionally under-reporting.\n \n&gt;(b) Don’t just believe what people tell you. Just because people tell you that if the dorms were better everything would be ok, you don’t just believe them. You ask why should it be? Don’t just take at face value. Just because someone has a PhD, don’t just believe him. Heck, don’t even believe me. Derive everything again by yourself from first principles.\n \n&gt;(c) Learn to use imagination and do thought experiments. Someone tells you, if you only listened to me and did this, everything will be good. Well, you just happily imagine that they were right and ask yourself, then what? The problem with these big mouths who talk a lot is that they just shoot off their mouths. They have no accountability to actually do anything. They have no sense of perspective, no sense of the costs and no sense of the practical constraints.\n \n&gt;(d) Have a sense of perspective. We are not the only country to have massive numbers of foreign or migrant workers. I don’t believe that the living conditions of our foreigner workers are the worst in the world. Other countries have no COVID infections in their dorms or dorm-equivalents we think? Are people so naive? Note that as far as I know, we are the *only* country, where the PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers. To tell them, not worry, Singapore will take care of them. Think about that for a moment. \n \n&gt;(e) School v Real Life. My complaint about school is that it often misleads our students into thinking that every problem has a model answer. Not true in life. There are situations where you know that sh*t is going to hit the fan and yet all you can do is to feel sorry for yourself while it happens in slomo. COVID19 is one such moment for Singapore. In times like this, we suck it up and wait to clean up after the mess is over. \n \n&gt;On this note, all please be good. Stay home and stay safe! If you need to go out, observe safe distancing and wash your hands regularly.', '&gt;**But guess what? The workers will still be eating together and working together. Do people understand how infectious this virus is? Even healthcare workers in full PPE can still catch it. Confirm will still kenna. Who are we kidding?** \n\nFor someone who claims to know statistics well, Ben really has a very poor understanding with how infections and distancing work. From a large population standpoint, infections are **not** a ""one-and-done"" deal. Statistics is hard to understand, but let me break it down for everyone. When you social distance for 23 hours a day, just because for the last hour you have dinner with friends, it doesnt mean that those 23 hours are somehow ""wasted"". If that were the case, we would ban everyone from leaving home even for groceries. \n\nInstead, the **probability** of you catching the virus has been lowered through distancing. Instead of 100 social interactions a day, distancing lowers that number to 1. Now your probability of getting infected is reduced by 99%. It doesnt stay at 100% just because you had that 1 social interaction. \n\nIts stupid to think that the **probability** of catching and spreading the virus would still be the same just because people **work and eat together.** \n\nIf dorms had more space, we could have reduced the probability of FWs catching and spreading the disease. On a population-level, this would translate to concrete and significant reductions in the number of people infected. Ben Leong is a joke of a prof if he cant understand simple laws of probability and chance. \n\nTLDR; Distance reduces the probability of getting infected and spreading infections. Taken a large population sample, this translates to actual concrete reduced numbers.', 'Ehhh your understand of statistics seems to be the exact same as his. You just never plug in the assumption that short contact also high chance. He’s working on a meal time only also 90 percent spread model while you’re on a 10 percent spread model. In the 90 percent spread model covid will always spread.', 'Actually, if you had read the full post instead of just the summary, it\'s quite obvious that Ben Leong (the author) is defending the government\'s policies. So I\'m not sure why you are trying to paint him as someone who is not ""committing to anything"".\n\nThat Ben Leong encourages the reader to derive their own conclusions doesn\'t change the fact that the primary aim of his post is to rebut Tan Weng Wah\'s criticism (and Ben Leong did a pretty good job of it IMO).', ""Thank you for the effort. It's a good read. (Pun intended)"", 'I think many people forget that the supposed ‘warning letter’ from the NGO also acknowledged that it is too hard to prevent dorm clusters, and only asked for Govt to make contingency plans should clusters form, which the Govt did.', ""&gt; what's the standards are we comparing to?\n\nLet's compare it to NS standards then, in which many of the older dorms or most factory-converted dorms still fail to meet it."", 'Improved to what exactly. Perhaps you could help me in my ignorance but has there been someone who has come out with a description of what this improved end state looks like?\n\nCurrent grouses. Too many people in one room, too few toilets, sanitation issues, what else. However it would be really useful to start being part of the solution. So how many people per square feet of bedroom space? How many to a room? What are the basic amenities? Number of sinks/toilet/shower per resident? Maximum distance between bedroom and sanitation? \n\nFrom this we can see what it does to the costs and we can also benchmark against the living conditions of non FW in Singapore (NS/one room hdb/prison).', ""I'm one of those who agree that we can do better. And if it means we should pay more for construction and labour costs so that migrant workers get a more decent standard of living, then I think we should do it. I mean, the government has galvanised ministries and stat boards to start converting unused sites into foreign dormitories, with as little as 6-8 in a room the size of a bmt section bunk. And from what it seem, it's probably going to be the middle-long term solution."", ""I don't think you really need such precise numbers to argue that conditions should be better"", ""How? People are always pushing for better conditions, but don't provide solutions/donations from their own pocket."", ""I don't think donations are how you get better dorm conditions. It's mostly a policy choice. Of course you also have to get people to implicitly accept higher building costs that come with better dorm conditions, but I don't think there is zero wiggle room in that regard given recent public reactions."", 'Actually, there really is almost zero wiggle room in that given recent public reactions. Who wants to pay more really? MRT fares for one, they increased a little, and everybody freaked out. Imagine this. Conservancy charges increasing will face backlashes. Same will go to housing prices.', 'Yeah but higher building costs are a bit less transparently passed on. It\'s not like there\'s gonna be an entry in your monthly HDB loan instalment saying ""foreign worker surcharge"".\n\nIn any case the government have already publicly expressed that standards should be raised', ""That's not the point. Stop looking at it on an individual level. The point is, on a population-level, the laws of statistics kick in and those models change. Even if we concede that there is a super high chance of spread during meal times, increased distancing would still reduce spread by a significant amount because you reduce spread during the 23 hours of the day. People like Ben really underestimate how much physical interaction one can really produce in those 23 hours in confined space."", ""Thank you Ben Leong. My conscience is clear and I can go back to cheer for pap again.\n\nSome people asked, where is the money coming from to improve conditions?\n\nTell me again, how much are the dorm operators earning?

Two of these robots are currently in operation in a dormitory in the eastern side of Singapore.\n\n&gt; Yes, that\'s how you pronounce its name.\n\n&gt; [caption id="""" align=""alignnone"" width=""480""] GIF by Sign SgSL with HEY.[/caption]\n\n&gt; What does M.A.T.A.R do?\n\n&gt; The autonomous M.A.T.A.R robots help the police in 24-hour surveillance and crime deterrence efforts. Mostly, they are there to ensure that CIF residents do not loiter during meal times and past bedtime.\n\n&gt; Roaming about on four wheels, the robots can help policemen to cover additional patrol routes without the need for someone to be constantly controlling them.\n\n&gt; Each M.A.T.A.R robot is also equipped with 360-degree cameras that have a recording function, allowing the police officers in an on-site control centre to ""see"" what is currently happening or has happened on the ground. It also has a mast that can extend up to two metres high to give the police officers a greater vantage point.\n\n&gt; Police can thus monitor and assess the situation first before intervening, said Inspector Teo Wan Ling, who is deployed at the dormitory.\n\n&gt; This also helps to keep police officers safe from infection as the robots are able to help them patrol an area without being in close contact with Covid-19 patients.\n\n&gt; ""M.A.T.A.R also has a \'voice\' and the Police are planning to leverage this feature to spread police-related messages,"" said Assistant Superintendent Daniel Toh.\n\n&gt; The police officers in the control centre can use a microphone to broadcast messages through the robot\'s speakers. Teo shared that M.A.T.A.R was able to dissolve \'small incidences\' by verbally reminding residents to observe safe distancing when queueing up for food.\n\n&gt; ""Most of the interactions here are minor, where a simple reminder would suffice. Most of the time, the M.A.T.A.R is sufficient,"" said Teo.\n\n&gt; ""The M.A.T.A.R also plays a deterrent role. When the (residents) actually see that the M.A.T.A.R is patrolling, generally they tend to adhere to the safe distancing measures,"" she added.\n\n&gt; The police are also exploring the broadcasting pre-recorded soundbites in different languages that the dormitory residents can understand.\n\n&gt; However, for incidences that happen within dorm rooms or above ground level, regular human police will have to intervene as M.A.T.A.R robots are not able to access these areas.\n\n&gt; Where else has it been deployed?\n\n&gt; Apart from the current dormitory, M.A.T.A.R robots had also been deployed at another government quarantine facility in the east.\n\n&gt; Previously, M.A.T.A.R had been deployed at National Day Parade 2019, Marina Bay Countdown 2020 and Chingay 2020. M.A.T.A.R robots are usually deployed at locations where there are large crowds and major events.\n\n&gt; Recently, M.A.T.A.R robots were undergoing trials at Bedok Police Division, but these trials were put on hold due to Covid-19. SPF may deploy M.A.T.A.R. in particular public locations only if safe distancing enforcement is needed.\n\n&gt; Other robots deployed to fight Covid-19\n\n&gt; Other then M.A.T.A.R, we\'ve been seeing lots of robots aiding Covid-19 efforts recently.\n\n&gt; These include SPOT, the safe-distancing robot dog at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, the teleconference \'Baymax\' robots, and the food robots deployed at Changi Exhibition Centre.\n\n&gt; By sending robots into areas where the risk of infection is high, the amount of uninfected staff working within these facilities can be reduced, and personnel can care for residents safely as well.\n\n&gt; Top photo by Singapore Police Force.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)', '""police state""', 'Matar lai liao!', '[Eye Have You](https://youtu.be/uD0H3EC08Gg)', 'Inb4 people compare this to Black Mirror or something.', 'The building looks like the sbs bus designer painted it', 'Matar in spanish mean ""kill"" lmao', ""I cam verify that.

This not a serious post just posting for fun. 

Yesterday I taking MRT in the morning on NE line, and at serangoon, there were safe distancing ambassadors waiting outside the doors. I think they were from CISCO or some other security company because they all had the same standard black long sleeve uniform and green traffic vest kind of things. What was damn funny (to me at least) was the freaking bright red armbands. I didn't manage to take or find a picture of them but here is a link[link](https://mustsharenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Safe-distancing-officer.jpg) to an image where someone is wearing the same armband.

The video was part of a demonstration video and proposal sent by the construction firm to MOM for consultation on 12 May 2020. We understand that the video was taken at the company\'s workshop and the vehicle with the proposed partitions set-up has not been put into use yet. MOM contacted the company in the afternoon of 13 May and clarified with them that the proposed set-up of the partitions in the rear of the lorry was not secure. MOM and LTA have collectively assessed that any sudden movement while travelling on the roads might dislodge the partitions and endanger occupants as well as other road users. We have informed the company of our assessment and advised them to review its plan. In order to comply with the required safe distancing while transporting the workers, MOM has already issued specific guidance (go.gov.sg/safedistancingonlorries). This will mean each lorry being permitted to carry fewer workers than before. We urge companies to reach out to the authorities to seek necessary clarification on safe distancing measures for lorries.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paradox-of-thrift.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paradox-of-thrift.asp) \n\nLike some other redditors have pointed out, it\'s more effective to keep people employed than to give cash everyone.\n\nSuppose we inject $100,000 into a business and 50,000 goes into their manpower costs, with the remaining 50,000 paying their suppliers. Now, their suppliers have the funds to keep *their* employees employed. These suppliers will be able to pay *their* vendors as well, keeping *their* employees employed. Some part of these funds goes back to the government via tax which can in turn be used in other ways. There is a huge multiplier effect here.\n\nAdditionally, people who are employed are more inclined to spend on ""wants"" (i.e. grabfood) rather than saving it up for ""needs"" (groceries). Again, spending is important for keeping people employed. \n\nIn short, the $x will be circulated many more times in the economy than if it was paid out in cash to the people (who would be more conservative with their money).', ""Although in theory your solution is sound, but practically there will always be loopholes. Giving money to people means in the short term you'd be able to cushion the impact (reducing economy impact) with the expenditure going to services that are currently available in this time, but eventually you need to be able to allow individuals to have their own money and to spend that money to push the economy moving forward. Simply putting money in individuals pocket doesn't work long term.\n\nThe overall bulk of the expenditure is going to business to supplement the income of their workers. As another comment mentioned, you put someone out of their job, the dependence on government aid increases, and that may surpass the number you've put out there.  \n\n\nREIT investors and all of those are running businesses, and their job is to generate revenue. Can't fault them for being that way. It sucks, but that is the reality. Then again, a rich people problem, and this is solved through legislation forcing them to push the money out.""]"

I saw a Caucasian Lady who is:
1) no running

3) looked really lost because she looks like she’s figuring out where to go
4) most importantly she isn’t wearing mask

“Hi miss, do you know it’s a must to wear a mask or else you will be fined” (something like that)

She looked at me quizzically 

I also noticed she is kinda lost and asked if she is looking for anything.

She told me she lives here

Husband and wife stays together during CCB. Husband loves to go for runs in the evening, while wife prefers to stay home. One day husband contracts Covid-19 virus. Wife is on close monitor and may also be infected.

For the good of this marriage, should the husband:

A) Apologise to the wife for causing her trouble, worry, and potentially infecting her with the virus.

B) Keep quiet and hopes that his wife understands his situation and never speak of this again.

C) Blame everyone else in the park for infecting him, even though he has tried to practice safe distancing while out running.

Forget anything outside our borders, or Singaporeans returning, that is unavoidable. Also analogies are confusion. Lets deal with facts. \n\nSome background Information - \n\n1) govt policy is to target an increase in population either by having a baby boom (sex in small spaces) or by PR / Citizenship investment.\n\n2) This leads to - scarcity of land, overpopulation of workers for building , infrastructure healthcare etc. - In short higher prices for everything and overcrowding for everyone. \n\nAlong comes covid - something all governments have to face in their unique way.\n\nBlunder 1) - NO NEED TO WEAR MASKS. GAMBLE FATE- this government message shows a few things, namely they are scared our healthcare system will be overworked. See reason 2 above. We don\'t have enough nurses beds etc.\n\n*Vietnam / Korea / China / HK / Taiwan - all advised to wear mask - where do we compare now.* \n\nBlunder 2) No system for checking be it random, or systematic - for sick people. It was purely reactive and no proactive.  In fact I saw a lot more warnings and threats from MOM and the Government if you want to go for a check to not overwhelm the system. Meanwhile infections continue, and events not cancelled like the airshow. \n\nThe build up of rhetoric every day was something new to be fined, jailed or have privilege suspended. \n\nThis would be fine, no pun intended, if the govt was doing some random and systematic checking.  It appears they weren\'t.  \n\nWhile officers were spot checking this and that, resources could have been allocated to do this, especially when the first FW\'s got it.  \n\nBlunder 3) Downplaying the entire problem. Dorscon orange - orange 2.0, whatever, While people tried to do their part*,* the govt kept businesses and schools open - allowing communities and clusters to form - all the while saying we are not at risk yet.\n\n*The combination of the 3 blunders effectively tell people to take this pandemic lightly.* \n\nWhen S finally HTF. Masking up became compulsory. A complete U turn, and still no one was checking the dorms!! MOM has printed brochures and pamphlets and pushed the responsibilities to dorm operators and employers! This is evident as worksites only were locked down AFTER CB and not together. They still didn\'t pick up the problem.\n\nSurely some scholar somewhere must have realized Dorms might be a problem. \n\nIn short summary - We are waaay too overpopulated to sustain than needed in terms of healthcare and distancing. This is Govt policy which has left a huge gap in terms of welfare for the lowest rungs. The taskforce seems to have some lacking members, like a uni group project , some people just wont work and take the credit. So much so a Senior Minister has to come in and ""advise"". \n\nInaction by MOM. Lack of foresight - don\'t blame it on hindsight. MOM didn\'t do their job. Now, EVERYONE from volunteers to army, to expo, to tanjong pagar terminals is cleaning up the mess.\n\n66 Healthcare workers, several nursing homes, child care centers, and lots of preventable deaths later, policy is just catching on to what other countries have been doing since February.\n\nMeanwhile mandates to call for election and provisions to vote are being made.\n\nIn summary - the system, direction, subsequent posturing and half baked reactions, and priorities of the govt are genuinely amiss.\n\nPerhaps they need time to reflect on this, and maybe they will feel sorry in their later years, that people died unnecessarily for a vision they set for the country. *The agenda doesn\'t match the needs of the people.* \n\nFinal comment: you can\'t solve everything with fines, threats, and making people sing ""home"".  I wouldn\'t get my hopes up for an apology. And it would be meaningless as well. The dirty looks and whispers you get from people for the rest of your days will suffice.', 'SAF has been the backbone of mask packing and logistics.

I’ll pay him millions to be the faultless leader of Singapore. \nThe government has been following advise from WHO until new research was available. Why don’t you blame WHO then? It’s a global pandemic which means new information will come to light as time passes.\n\nMaybe in a couple of months they will find out even masks cannot stop the spread. What then? Blame the government for encouraging us to wear masks? \n\nPEOPLE DIED BECAUSE ITS A PANDEMIC. Not because of the government.\n\nI respect the government more and trust them because of the way they’ve handled this situation.

It wouldn\'t have been hard for MOM to extract that data and say ""shit we need to do something"". \n\nI agree, Vietnam, Korea, China, NZ, even HK, Taiwan, Australia, can say more and sing praises on their govt\'s foresight.\n\nI\'d say we\'re in the league of Italy, Canada (btw is getting tons more money handed out to it\'s citizens than SG). , but not USA or UK yet.\n\nYou can respect whoever you want.

Period.\n\nAsk yourself again, what are you blaming her for? Reply, so I can give you an answer that encompass all sorts of factors that points to why in a “global pandemic” you should not be pushing for someone to be blame at every turn of the situation.

Eh how come 50 cases in sg!?!? We should not even have 1!”\n\nOn this basis, the finger pointing and fault finding will never end. So as much as I get the point of you wanting to start a thread to get enough validation for your own opinions on Josephine, ultimately this will go no where and even if you do manage to get what you want, it will not explain in a constructive manner the main problem at hand, which is, the existence of this virus and how contagious it is.', ""The government isn't just jogging because he likes it, he's also balancing the needs of multiple parties in his family, as well as an uncertain virus that may or may not become a pandemic. Both jogging and stopping jogging will cause problems to his family. Information about the virus comes from an unreliable source as no one knows how truthful China may or may not be. WHO is trying hard to prevent a global panic by downplaying the situation. \n\nNow we're in May in the middle of a developing situation asking for an apology for a bad response? Yes the response is bad but hindsight is 20/20. If the government back then based the epidemiology model on SARS, it wouldn't have been a full blown pandemic like today. Migrant worker populations didn't get overrun like Cov19.\n\nApologies are just lip service. I don't want them to just pin the blame on someone.

I compare what has been done here for the situation in Singapore, vs what is done in other countries there and then. So far I feel they are making decisions based on science and facts, and the resources available then. It is a novel coronavirus, the situation can change in hours and a decision made previously may well have to be backtracked on.\n\nEverything and anything revisited CAN be done better, assuming there are more or infinite resources and time. But remember the situation then - e.g. 4 critical things may be happening then simultaneously vs 1 now.\n\nNothing falls from the sky, the money is provided to tide those that really need it over present difficult times. Considering the disruption to global supply chains, I expect many goods to increase in price even before increase in our transport or conservancy fees. Assuming that I still have a job by the time this pandemic ends, I too hope to still be able to do my due duties as a citizen to fund the daily on-goings of my country.\n\nIt will be tough times ahead, even after a cure or vaccine is found as I believe many industries could well have almost disappeared (cinemas? tourism?) by then.

I would be impressed if the PAP does through. Almost impressed enough to overlook how they fumbled their handling of the pandemic. Almost. \n\nI would also like to make it doesn’t that I don’t blame China for being the origin of the virus. I blame the CCP government for covering up the spread, and the WHO for being complicit in propagating their lies. \n\nI mean, if we go back to where it all began, the problem was exacerbated by us blindly believing WHO guidelines and a reluctance to not do anything that might be perceived as antagonising China. That resulted in advice that was at odds with the reality of the situation (no need to wear masks early on?), constant back-peddling, the need to now burn through our reserves to tackle an issue entirely of the PAP government’s own doing (the overcrowding of dorms), and everything just lagging 2-3 weeks behind everyone else (even Malaysia is lifting their lockdown already). \n\nI have no doubt our current government is working hard to fix the problem. This isn’t any different from a worker who screws up an assignment and has to burn the midnight oil to redo it from scratch. They are doing what they are paid to do, and so this doesn’t absolve them of any blame whatsoever. \n\nWhich to me also begs the question. If we can find at least one foreign worker demanding that Josephine Teo apologise, would she then do so? I can just imagine the people watching her response and going “challenge accepted”. 🤔😏😎', ""&gt;The government has been following advise from WHO until new research was available. Why don’t you blame WHO then?\n\nThe Singapore government ignored the initial WHO advice not to restrict international travel. This shows that the Singapore was already capable of exercising its own judgement (and that is not a very high bar to clear, honestly).

In total, they were cheated of more than $50,000.\n\n&gt; In most cases, the victims had befriended the scammers or searched for sexual services through online applications such as WeChat, Tinder and Michat, or on websites such as Locanto and Skokka.\n\n&gt; There were also instances where scammers proactively approached the victims through these online applications or websites to offer sexual services.\n\n&gt; The victims were then instructed to either make advance payments via AliPay credits at AXS machines or buy iTunes or Google Play gift cards and send over the redemption codes in exchange for the sexual services. The scammers became uncontactable after the advance payments were made.\n\n&gt; In the first three months of the year, the police received 237 reports of credit-for-sex scams involving more than $613,000. The number of cases reported increased by 40.2 per cent and the total amount cheated increased by more than $211,000 when compared with the same period last year.\n\n&gt; The police advised the public to be wary of friend requests or online listings offering escort, massage or sexual services as they may be fraudulent in nature.\n\n&gt; The police said scammers may employ scare tactics to threaten victims into making more payments. They urged the public not to accede to the scammers' demands or give out personal details such as their credit card information.\n\n&gt; They added that people should take circuit breaker measures seriously, and avoid going out during this period.\n\n&gt; Those in doubt or have information related to credit-for-sex crimes may call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000, or visit www.police.gov.sg/iwitness.

Seah Kian Peng

This morning, I walked alone through the various kopitiams as well the wet market, playing the role of a safe distancing ambassador (SDA). Talked to some residents and merchants as well as group of SDAs when they were having their lunch break. A few observations :
1. Compliance is high;
2. Merchants and residents all understood importance of wearing a face mask and the need for safe distancing and we are all getting used to it;
3. Temperature screening and crowd control measures were in place at popular places like supermarkets and wet market;
4. For those who sometimes forget, a gentle reminder to keep to safe distancing is all that is required; and finally on a lighter note
5. Even with a mask on, most people seem to be able to recognize me.

What qualifications,experience and maturity levels have been defined as selection criteria for safe distancing ambassadors to be able perform this sacrosanct duty objectively? If government is only giving $600, then I’m sure we agree that $300/$1000 is a huge amount to be fined.

I was alighting a train yesterday and a big sized Safe Distancing Ambassador was standing on the platform blocking the path to the staircase with back facing me and talking on the phone. If I just squeezed past the ambassador, would I have got a fine even though he/she was the one not being observant of his surroundings? If I said ‘excuse me’ loudly to a safe distancing ambassador (because he is 2 metres away and talking on the phone)- will I get fined for verbally harassing an Ambassador? 

What is concerning was that the ambassador team had 3 people and the other 2 in the team did see me trying to walk forward but did not bother to wave/signal to their big size colleague to give way. It almost felt like the ambassador team feels ‘untouchable’ in how they are behaving.

I ended up standing still and waiting for the big sized safe ambassador to stroll away on his own before I made my way down the staircase.

On safe distancing measures for smokers

Can I leave my home to smoke and can I remove my mask to smoke outside?

You must put on a mask when you leave your home and you may only leave your home for essential purposes, such as to work in essential services or to buy food. Leaving your home, just to smoke, is not an essential purpose. If you are out for an essential purpose and have to smoke, you may do so in an area where smoking is not prohibited under the smoking prohibition law, with the mask removed. However, you must put your mask back on immediately after smoking and keep a safe distance of at least 1 metre from others. Do not loiter around after smoking or socialise with other smokers.  

NEA will continue its enforcement for safe distancing and smoking prohibition. The fines for smoking prohibition offence and violation of safe distancing measures are $200 and $300 respectively. In addition, second-time offenders of the safe distancing measures will face a $1,000 composition fine, or prosecution in court for egregious cases.",singapore,229750,FAQ from NEA for smokers,,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g4843p/faq_from_nea_for_smokers/,[]

[I personally don't think train frequencies should be reduced during peak hours.](https://preview.redd.it/bcvh6nv92at41.jpg?width=2211&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6081e58114a866075ead1faffc3d019c7ac92110)

Look at the crowd.

According to LTA, they are reducing the frequency because...

&gt;daily bus and rail ridership has fallen by more than 71% and 75% respectively

However, the maximum capacity of a train also reduces by at least 50% due to the safety distancing measures in place.

Usually in between two green 'Please Stand Here' spots in the cabin, there could potentially be 2 to 3 more commuters. For the two spots at the corner of the door which has a wider gap, it could potentially have had 4 more people standing in between those spots.

We all know that during peak hours, especially at stations where we need to switch lines such as Buona Vista, the train is normally packed to the brim and we could miss a couple of trains just to get in on a normal day (at a 3 minutes per train frequency). Normally in that situation I would only need to wait 3 to 6 minutes. However, as for today, I missed two trains as I couldn't get onto it, and wasted 10 minutes.

This is LTA's promise as they reduce the train frequency.

&gt;In so doing, LTA and the operators will ensure that there is sufficient space for commuters to maintain safe distancing from one another. These adjustments will help to mitigate the significant financial impact caused by the reduced riderships, and help keep public transport operations financially sustainable.

Today, there were a few essential workers who were ***rushing*** for work and they entered the train despite there being no empty seats (aside from the ones marked with crosses) and green spots left. I can understand their actions. The 5 to 6 crowd control ushers was insufficient to manage the huge crowd and disallow people from entering the train after the green spots are filled. (I was counting because I walked across the platform to a less crowded area after I decided not to board the first train, and had nothing to do anyways.)

In my opinion, 5 to 6 crowd control ushers is plenty. However, imagine the scenario where the train comes every 5 minutes. Only three quarters of the queue managed to board. The next wave of commuters come in.

New queue = commuters who didn't manage to board the previous train + new commuters coming in

There's just simply too many people. All of us are likely to be essential workers too. I'm not fighting in the front lines like those providing healthcare services, but I am an essential worker too. Imagine a nurse trying to get to work, lethargic and needing to wake up earlier, just to get to work on time. She/He would have already been tired from being overloaded with work, and yet they still have to put up with this long queue and over-packed cabins?

My point / TLDR :

I think it is alright to reduce train and bus frequencies, but not during peak hours when people are all trying to go to work on time.

Visited Tiong Bahru Market today to see how the stallholders are doing. I wanted to reassure them of the government’s support, and shared with them the measures we have put in place to help safeguard their livelihoods and well-being amidst the COVID-19 situation. 

One of the new measures we are introducing, to protect both stallholders and patrons, is to require ALL food/drinks handlers at F&amp;B establishments to wear masks or other forms of physical barriers such as face shields. This includes personnel at restaurants, caterers, supermarkets, food courts, coffee shops as well as those in our hawker centres and markets.  
 
From Monday, 13 April, our Enforcement Officers (EOs) and Safe Distancing Ambassadors will ensure F&amp;B employees meet this new requirement, and take enforcement action  such as fines, prosecution and licence suspension against non-compliant establishments. This requirement  will remain beyond the COVID-19 crisis as it is a good practice not just to safeguard public health but also to prevent food contamination. EOs will also continue to remind all F&amp;B employees to stay home if they are unwell. 
 
I have previously shared on how we are helping stallholders with their rental, table-cleaning and central dishwashing fees: (removed the Facebook link)
 
This is a tough time for all our stallholders but with the COVID-19 situation swiftly evolving, it is more important than ever that we upkeep cleanliness and public hygiene. Although we cannot dine in at eating places during this period, do continue to lend your support to our hawker centres and the F&amp;B sector  - patronise their stalls by ordering takeout (bring your own clean containers! ♻️) or delivery. 

We are into our 5th day of circuit-breaker measures, and our actions now will determine whether Singapore successfully contains the outbreak. Do remember to stay home except to go out for essential goods and services. And to keep a safe distance of at least one metre away from the next person when you are out. 

Stay home, and stay safe.

 
今天走访中峇鲁巴刹了解小贩们的情况，并向他们解释政府为了帮助他们维持生计，所给予的支持和措施。

加强清洁卫生是对抗疫情的关键。为了保护摊贩和食客的安全，我们将规定所有在餐饮场所售卖和准备食物或饮料的员工，必须佩戴口罩或面罩。这包括餐馆、餐饮外包服务、超市、食阁、咖啡店，还有所有小贩中心和巴刹的摊贩。这将是长久性的规定，帮助提高卫生标准并确保食物安全。国家环境局正为所有小贩分发可重复使用的口罩。
从4月13日起，我们的执法人员和安全距离大使将确保餐饮业员工遵守这项新规定，并对违规者采取执法行动。执法人员也会继续提醒所有餐饮业员工，若身体不适务必留在家中，不可处理食物。

虽然我们暂时无法在外用餐，但我鼓励大家继续通过打包或外送服务支持我们的小贩中心和餐饮业。打包时请记得自行携带清洁的容器，为环保尽一份力♻️！

ZeroPauper,1598068582,iebqzr,87,1,"I am curious about how school routines have changed for the different tertiary schools due to the COVID-19 situation! I'll kickstart the sharing with how NTU is like now.

​

# NTU

* Safe entry to every school building/foodcourt, but you are free to roam about the common areas
* Most lectures were pushed online with tutorials/labs still conducted in physical classes
* No standing in campus buses (Because COVID-19 only affects those who stand, right?)

**My observations:**

It feels like the week before finals even though we have only started the semester. Students are crowding everywhere from school buildings to common areas for their online lessons. Apparently lectures were shifted online to facilitate ""safe distancing"" and reduce the number of students on campus, but this has backfired for a simple reason - Tutorials and labs are still conducted in person.

Most students have a mix of both online and physical lessons in a single day, with little breaks between them. To illustrate what I mean, imagine you have an online class in the morning followed by a 1 hour break before your physical class starts. If you stay &gt;1 hour away from NTU (which is very common), you have no choice but to camp in school for your online class as you will be late for your physical class if you came from home after the online class. I guess this is the main reason why we see common areas flooded with students at any time of the day.

**NTU has a standing agreement with COVID-19 to not infect students who are sitting down on campus buses**

# NTU

* Safe entry to every school building/foodcourt, but you are free to roam about the common areas
* Most lectures were pushed online with tutorials/labs still conducted in physical classes
* No standing in campus buses (Because COVID-19 only affects those who stand, right?)

**My observations:**

It feels like the week before finals even though we have only started the semester. Students are crowding everywhere from school buildings to common areas for their online lessons. Apparently lectures were shifted online to facilitate ""safe distancing"" and reduce the number of students on campus, but this has backfired for a simple reason - Tutorials and labs are still conducted in person.

Most students have a mix of both online and physical lessons in a single day, with little breaks between them. To illustrate what I mean, imagine you have an online class in the morning followed by a 1 hour break before your physical class starts. If you stay &gt;1 hour away from NTU (which is very common), you have no choice but to camp in school for your online class as you will be late for your physical class if you came from home after the online class. I guess this is the main reason why we see common areas flooded with students at any time of the day.

Cases of mumps have also fallen, from 258 to 179.\n\n&gt; The figures also showed a decline in the number of recorded cases for whooping cough – from 49 this time last year to just 11 this year.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; The number of invasive pneumococcal disease has also dropped from 91 at this time last year to 36 this year.\n\n&gt; An almost deserted Shenton Way, which is situated in the Central Business District, usually sees heavy traffic during the day. (Photo: Jeremy Long)\n\n&gt; There was a similar decline in cases of melioidosis (34 to 21), which can be contracted when someone comes in contact with contaminated water and soil. According to SingHealth, melioidosis can be associated with severe infections, with mortality rates as high as 40 per cent in some cases.\n\n&gt; There have also been drastic decreases in the weekly number of people seeking treatment at polyclinics for more common infectious diseases, such as acute diarrhoea, acute conjunctivitis and chickenpox.\n\n&gt; In the week ending May 30 – a day before the end of the circuit breaker – the number of people treated at polyclinics for acute diarrhoea fell from 637 last year to just 141.\n\n&gt; The trend has continued into Phase 2: In the week ending Aug 8, only 336 people this year sought treatment for acute diarrhoea compared to the 696 in the same week last year.\n\n&gt; There were similar trends for instances of acute conjunctivitis, chickenpox and hand, foot and mouth disease.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; INCREASED AWARENESS ABOUT HYGIENE\n\n&gt; Associate Professor Richard Sugrue, from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU)’s School of Biological Sciences, told CNA he was not surprised at the fall in the number of airborne infectious diseases.\n\n&gt; “Airborne agents can be very infectious and easily spread between people that come in close contact,” he said.\n\n&gt; “The isolation of individuals at home during the circuit breaker had largely restricted the movement of people.\n\n&gt; “This in effect impedes the transmission process of these biological agents by reducing number of occasions when an individual can potentially come into contact with an infected person.\n\n&gt; “You only have to think of a school where children intermingle and transmission of respiratory-borne agents can occur.”\n\n&gt; An “additional effect” of the circuit breaker is the increased awareness about the spread of infectious diseases in the community.\n\n&gt; People may now be “more aware” of the importance of maintaining good personal hygiene, leading to reduced instances of virus transmission, Assoc Prof Sugrue said.\n\n&gt; A person using hand sanitiser. (Photo: Marcus Mark Ramos)\n\n&gt; Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases physician at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, said people masking up also helped prevent the transmission of droplet-borne diseases.\n\n&gt; “No meeting, no transmission,” he added.\n\n&gt; National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Professor Paul Tambyah said it was “hard” to attribute changes in the numbers to the circuit breaker.\n\n&gt; “There are many facets of the lockdown including cutbacks in some screening services, which might have had an impact on HIV detection rates, for example,” he told CNA.\n\n&gt; But he said there may be “direct impact”, such as fewer cases of respiratory infections and diarrhoea due to social isolation.\n\n&gt; “There also may be other indirect effects such as reduced testing for some viruses due to the need to conserve swabs and reagents for (COVID-19),” he said.\n\n&gt; This means there may not have been “an actual drop” in the number of cases, but rather, a reduction in case detection.\n\n&gt; Members of the public queue to enter Ngee Ann City in Orchard on Jun 19, the first day the shopping centre was allowed to reopen after Singapore's circuit breaker. (Photo: Jeremy Long)\n\n&gt; INCREASE IN PHASE 2?\n\n&gt; With the country now in Phase 2, the experts believe the easing of measures and the increased contact and interaction between people might lead to more infections.\n\n&gt; “This is not something to be alarmed about since this is actually the normal situation in the community,” explained Assoc Prof Sugrue.\n\n&gt; “It can actually lead to increased herd immunity in a population. It just means that people that are at risk of developing severe symptoms from, example, COVID-19 or influenza virus infection, should be monitored.”\n\n&gt; Dr Leong said the “creep up will be slow” because people are still wearing masks when they are out and about.\n\n&gt; RISE IN DENGUE CASES\n\n&gt; Not all infectious diseases have been slowed by the coronavirus measures. There has been a surge in dengue cases, with Singapore in the midst of its worst dengue outbreak, with 23,500 cases as of Aug 8.\n\n&gt; In all, 20 people have died from dengue this year as of Aug 2, said the MOH. The youngest victim was 25 years old, while the oldest was 92 years old.\n\n&gt; Eighteen of the victims had worked or lived in active dengue clusters.\n\n&gt; File photo of a fogging operation in Geylang. (Photo: Try Sutrisno Foo)\n\n&gt; During the circuit breaker period, non-essential workplaces and schools were shuttered and people were told to stay home.\n\n&gt; This could have led to more residential mosquito breeding and more opportunities for “blood meals”, said Associate Professor Luo Dahai from NTU's Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine to CNA previously.\n\n&gt; The Aedes aegypti mosquito, which spreads the dengue virus, dwells mainly in indoor spaces and bites primarily during the day.\n\n&gt; Assoc Prof Sugrue said there might now be a reduction in the weekly number of dengue cases, with things “starting to return to normal”.\n\n&gt; But this decline will depend on other environmental factors. If there is increased rainfall, it could lead to an increase in the number of stagnant pools of water that collect after rain, he added.\n\n&gt; Mount Elizabeth Hospital’s Dr Leong said the number of dengue cases “will still be massive”, because a lot of people are still working from home, and that the number of people returning to work places is “not enough to make a difference”.\n\n&gt; Prof Tambyah said the number of people going to work is not going to reduce dengue incidence.\n\n&gt; “The Aedes mosquito bites at dusk and anecdotally many of us are bitten in the evenings on the way back from work or the supermarket,” he added.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"", 'That or simply because people are afraid to visit the doctors for this period. \n\nMC for 5 days as long you show any respiratory related symptoms.

&amp;nbsp;

**Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herewith are strictly mine as a private citizen and has nothing to do with my employer, the National University of Singapore.**

After Ivangate, we now have the 10-Million-Populationgate. Really not v sexy and not v scandalous, but this kaypoh here has decided that he should weigh in on this topic because having a good handle on our national position on this topic will be critical to this country’s unity in the years ahead. 

In case people have no idea what this 10-Million-Populationgate is about, let’s talk about the manifestos for this GE. Frankly, they are completely underwhelming.

PAP’s manifesto is more or less a summary of the 6 political broadcasts, but cannot blame them. That’s how it works for the incumbent. Nobody is surprised. Nothing to see here. 

Rest of the political parties, uncle here has good news. Next GE don’t need to write manifesto already. Uncle here will write a bot that goes around the coffeeshops to collect all the grievances and deploy an app for you. You go and pick your favourite set of grievances and the app will deploy advanced AI to generate your new manifesto. 

WP’s manifesto is probably the most comprehensive and covered the most ground. Probably includes like 95% of all the complaints. However, there is something uncle here cannot for his life figure out. Wonderboy Dr Jamus Lim claims that they have a plan. A plan to balance their plan. I was once a good, though failed mathematician. I would like to see that spreadsheet and learn some financial magic. In case people don’t realize, “moving left” has a cost and people might want to check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLJBzhcSWTk). I might have missed it, but I don't see how WP plans to raise revenue to do their ""left shift.""

I am not out to put down WP and I actually hope that WP can keep both Hougang SMC and Aljunied GRC (really!), but I think Pritam needs to learn something from Mr Low and not do such irresponsible electioneering. Just because confirm don’t need to run the Government doesn’t mean WP should anyhow hoot for maximum electoral advantage. 

WP is essentially doing what my weak students do. 2 mark question don’t know the answer, anyhow whack 1 x essay and let the prof pick the answer for him. These kinds of answers, I generally mark zero. I hope that the WP can wake up their idea and do better at next GE. If want to use my auto-manifesto generator also can. I like them (more than the other Opposition parties) so I will give them discount. I need to warn them however that in spite of my genius, I don’t know how to write that magic accounting module. Perhaps after Wonderboy enlightens me, I might be able to add that. No extra charge. 

Two quick notes about the manifestos:

(a) There’s this [Teh Tarik Party manifesto](https://hopeful-ptolemy-1f5c3f.netlify.app/Teh%20Tarik%20Party%20Manifesto%202020.pdf). I think it’s supposed to be a joke, but it’s surprisingly thoughtful and original. Opposition parties might want to take a leaf from this joker(s). 

(b) SDP’s manifesto takes the cake. When I first saw the “No,” I was like what the hell is that? Guess what, the SDP’s strategy was to confront the Government on it’s alleged “plan for 10 million population” and have the Government deny having such a plan. Basically, SDP would be the first Party in the history of Singapore politics to be able to deliver on its election promises even before Polling Day. Genius. Why didn’t I think of that? Maybe next GE can try “Sun will rise from the East”?

&amp;nbsp;

#Background: Population White Paper Circa 2013

That said, there is no smoke without fire. The fact that we are seeing this “10 million population target” suggests that the Government has completely failed to communicate properly. For context, this kaypoh once whacked the Government on the Population White Paper before, back in 2013.^[1] 

To be fair to the Government, the White Paper was patently reasonable. The problem back in 2013 was that the Government was more or less tone-deaf to table that paper while the population was fuming mad over the various issues we were facing. Mostly people were pissed with the over-crowding of the MRTs, and also the breakdowns. 

I cited 4 burning issues back in 2013:

1. The MRT was crowded and broke down every other week
1. The property market was still overpriced
1. The COEs were way too expensive
1. Many Singaporeans were extremely unhappy with the large and sudden influx of foreigners

The first 3 have more or less been fixed thanks to COVID (for better or for worse). In this note, I would be addressing the 4th issue: foreigners in our midst.

Allow me to clarify that everything I am saying today, I already knew back in 2013, but it is seriously unpleasant to try to defend the Government. I was also a bit upset with the Government back in 2013, so I wasn’t in the mood to do so. Basically it wasn’t my job to do so -- which is still the case today.

But, I am speaking up today for 2 reasons:

(a) We are facing this humongous mess called COVID19. PAP has shown itself unable to learn how to communicate clearly after 7 years. I have no reason to believe that anything will change in this GE. Teacher will generally not tell the student the answer, but if the exam is tomorrow and the student is still mucking around and cannot figure out, sometimes will just have to tell the answer. Survive exam first, and then scold later.

(b) We have witnessed both Brexit and the rise of Trump since 2013. The assumption that the population can necessarily tell fact from fiction is severely challenged. I don’t think we want to take any chances. If people want to vote out the PAP, please go ahead, but please make sure that it’s on the basis of fact and not on fiction. The “10 million population target” is just a calculated attempt to make people angry. 

We cannot give in to the politics of anger. 

&amp;nbsp;

#What is the Government’s Target Population?

This question has been making its rounds in view of this 10 million population issue. Chan Chun Seng tried to address this last night in the Mandarin debates, but not sure how many people tuned in, so allow me to clarify a couple of things that should be kinda obvious, except that people don’t seem to understand (perhaps because it’s not tested in the PSLE).

First, notwithstanding that Singaporeans are not reproducing ourselves, the Government does not happily then import foreigners so that we don’t die out. It just \*does not\* work that way.  The claim that Government is importing a lot of foreigners to so that these foreigners will vote for the PAP doesn’t seem to have borne out from what I have seen. In fact, since mid-2010’s, it has become extremely difficult for the foreigners to obtain PR.

Who do I know this? Because in addition to being MP for NUSWhispers, I have also effectively been MP to many of my foreign students in helping them to appeal for PR. People might be wondering why the foreigners would care about PR. One word: school. 

My foreign students have done well and are mostly highly paid software engineers. Living comfortably in Singapore and getting married is not a problem. They love it here. The problem comes when they have kids. Without PR, it becomes nigh impossible to get a place in the local school system and the private schools are way too expensive (they are paid well, but since they are young, they are not quite at expat levels). And when I talk about local schools, we are talking about a random neighbourhood school. Foreigners (PR or otherwise) have very little hope of getting into our branded Primary schools. I have had students go back to their home countries or leave for Canada because of this reason. It is damn stupid for us to import them into this country, train them well and have them leave because they cannot get their kids into school. 

Second, contrary to some claims, Government does not directly create jobs. Mostly what the Government does is to put in money to “incentivize” the private sector to create jobs. Technically, the Government is the biggest consumer of public goods, i.e. sanitation, grass cutting, etc., but most of these functions have been outsourced to the private sector. The Government did magic up thousands of “safe distancing ambassador” and COVID swabber jobs over the last few months, but that’s really a short term immediate relief scheme. I hope that nobody is thinking of a long-term career as a  “safe distancing ambassador.” **Only the private sector is capable of creating good jobs in the long term.** In this light, the Government really has no direct control in terms of how many foreigners will be imported into this country, except to prevent the private sector from hiring foreigners.

Our whole economy is currently being hammered. Many SMEs are folding. The Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) is only applicable to Singaporeans and PRs. Some 60,000 foreigners have already lost their jobs. Once the scheme ends in August, we will see even more bloodshed. Many Singaporeans, foreigners, all will lose jobs together. Those foreigners who cannot secure a new job and who do not already have PR will all get deported. PAP should just have learnt from SDP and campaigned on reducing foreigner worker numbers by 100,000. Confirm can deliver on election promise. 

One of the advantages of having a lot of foreigners in the local workforce is that in times like this, the foreigners actually provide a significant buffer for the local workers. In the good old days with unemployment at 1% (which I always felt was too low), the Government had very little choice but to allow companies to import foreigners, but as unemployment numbers creep up to 4% or 5%, it will be v difficult for the companies to argue that they cannot find locals willing to work and will die die have to import foreigners. 

I actually have a lot more to say about the issue of foreign workers, but you are probably tired of reading my mad ramblings and my fingers are tired from typing, so I will stop here. 

Allow me to just summarize the issue as follows. The Government does need to work with something in terms of city planning, but that is mostly an infrastructure problem. That’s where we have these 6.9m and 10m numbers. Basic idea is to make sure that things are spread out enough that we do not get congestion no matter how much the population grows. The problem with infrastructure is that it takes a long time and long-term planning to do properly, so we need to be kiasu a bit and plan for it to be so big that we can be assured we won’t run into the wall. 

The actual population growth depends on how the economy grows. General principle is to allow adequate supply of foreign labour to maintain steady growth while keeping local unemployment low. More or less like that.  Government does not have a full view of how things will turn out. If the PAP Government wants to claim that it is omniscient, then I stand corrected and rest my case. Given COVID, past trends are of absolutely no help. Also, technological disruptions are another headache. If autonomous cars appear, then all the taxi uncles and Grab drivers will be out of jobs overnight and the Government will have yet another 60,000 unemployed people to deal with. When it comes to dealing with the economy, who the hell knows exactly what will happen? 2 decades ago, we didn’t even have iPhones!

&amp;nbsp;

#The Real Threat to Singapore Livelihoods: WFH, Not Foreigners

To conclude, I think that everyone is barking up the wrong tree. 

Post-COVID, everything is going to change. Why? Because WFH actually works and in many cases, works v v well. [80% of Singaporeans surveyed want to work from home](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/8-10-spore-employees-wish-continue-working-home-after-circuit-breaker-survey). Some of these are good workers. The rest are likely slackers. The remaining 20%? The bosses. :-P

More seriously, it is v difficult (if not impossible) to change work habits, but COVID19 has forced many companies to work differently and because Zoom works really well, many are going to find that working remotely will help them save on office rental. 

WFH allows the productive workers to save time from commuting and also provides them with significantly more flexibility to manage their time (as long as MOE doesn’t also close and they can continue to pack their kids off to school). 

The flip side is that there are slackers among us (you know the ones who will chao keng during NS?). There are also the older workers who are unable to cope with technology. Also, a lot of the jobs in our current economy are really bullsh*t jobs. What are these jobs? These jobs don’t actually need a degree or specialized skills. Mostly it is people shuffling paper and sending emails, and having long, meaningless meetings. Sounds familiar? 

WFH requires more communication skills than degrees. Notwithstanding our so-called world class education system and high PISA scores, I daresay that the Americans are much better communicators than Singaporeans at large. 

Given the abysmal state of the American economy and our high cost structure, I would not be surprised if our local companies start outsourcing to the US. Timezone is a problem? Perhaps, but there are people like me who are fully functional in the middle of the night and who prefer to sleep in the day. If people are hungry enough, they will be willing to take on jobs at odd hours, especially if they have no need to leave their homes.

Tuition in Singapore will also be moving online. Since Phase 2, my daughter is now doing alternate week Zoom for Chinese tuition. My wife is also v tired of having to ferry her to tuition every week. 100% Zoom is frankly ok for us, but the Chinese teacher suggested this blended arrangement, and so we just played along. 

Most things in life, cut both ways. While WFH puts us at risk of losing jobs overseas, it also provides our people with access to better jobs globally. A small number of my students have over the years been able to work from the beaches in Australia or at the cafes in Paris. This lifestyle is just going to be much more common moving forward for the mobile knowledge workers. 

The question that needs to be asked is not so much what is that target number of foreigners, but how are we going to respond to these seismic shifts in the global economy?

&amp;nbsp;

\-------

**Addendum**

I don’t know exactly what the Government at large is doing, but I did receive an email from DPM Heng a couple of months ago. DPM was my ex-boss at MOE. He asked, “We need to invest in online learning, do you have any ideas on how we might be able do it?” Since then, his dunno what Emerge Stronger Taskforce has also gotten in touch to discuss the export of our education services/offerings as a new potential engine of growth for this country. Will the Government succeed in leading this country out of the current mess? I suspect that it’s too early to say, but sure as hell, people are working on it. 

And yes, this is the DPM who works too hard and who doesn’t sleep enough. Yes, so he makes a bungle on Nomination Day because he doesn’t get enough rest. 

And people make fun of him. 

I hope that all of you are proud of yourselves.

There are also many disadvantages of hiring a local (CPF, Reservist, etc) which makes the playing field uneven, especially for high end jobs since there is no levy or quota for E passes. If you are able to show with concrete evidence that NO Singaporean is displaced at the expense of hiring a foreigner then these public unrests may not come to life.\n\nThe growing population due to influx of foreigners will most definitely happen and sadly there is not much we can do about it. Firstly Singapore's economic growth comes mainly from Labour Growth and accumulation of capital. There is almost non existent growth in our economy due to productivity growth.

Pay $4 a month, and if you get sacked you draw 75% of your salary for the first 6 months, 50% for the next 6, etc. I actually like this idea; it has the potential to be budget neutral. The only question is, not everyone is going to want to pay the insurance. If someone earning $4k is retrenched, you need 750 people paying $4 a month to offset that per month for the first 6 months. If 1,000 people are retrenched (which is not unlikely), you need 750,000 people paying $4 a month to offset that for just the first 6 months.\n\nOf course, not everyone who gets retrenched will buy this insurance, but it's the same for people who will choose not to buy the insurance.

As for the payout amount, i think there will be a cap on the maximum amount you can get per month. \n\nAn alternative would be instead of 4 dollars per month for every income group, we can adjust the premiums payment according to your income similar to your cpf contributions. In insurance they call what you mention as adverse selection where only people who are more at risk would take up the insurance if i remember correctly.

Kopi0Kosong,1593677213,hjt0j4,18,1,"Since there was some news about Resorts World Sentosa reopening, I've been checking it out today. I bought the Season Pass offer for USS just before CB and fortunately they extended it with the amount of days the park was closed.

Today was the 2nd day the park reopened for visitors with all the safe distancing measures in place. Therefore they allowed only 25% of their usual capacity. The first change noticable was that you need to register in advance via an online form with a valid ticket of season pass. Once accepted, you get a confirmation email which you need to show at the entrance.

Once you entered the park its considerably more quiet obviously. The park is open from 2 to 9pm (I didnt found that on the website, so I was very early there already), but good they open later at night, as they used to close earlier before. Some of the smaller attractions are closed and all the shows are not in operation. But most of the attractions are open.

There are quite a lot of Safe Distancing Ambassadors walking around. Every attraction has one to spread out the queue. Theres at least 3 meters between visitors in queues. Also the attractions have spaced out seating arrangements.

Because theres less people in the attractions, the waiting time can also take a lot longer than usual, even with 25% park capacity. In the Battlestar Galactica it was a waiting time of 50 minutes because of that, with not that many people waiting. (Also fortunately they reopened my locker free of charge lol)

If you're alone or with an uneven group, someone will sit alone. You'll not sit next to a stranger. And theres always a row empty between passengers. 

When I went into the Mummy as a single rider, there was another single rider in front of me in the queue. So we had a train with 2 persons, which normally seats 16 persons.

Looking at the CECA chapter on movement of natural persons, article 9.1.3 says:\n\nNothing  contained  in  this  Chapter  shall  prevent  a  Party  from  applying  measures to  regulate  the  entry  or  temporary  stay  of  natural  persons  of  the  other  Party  in  its territory,  including  measures  necessary  to  protect  the  integrity  of  its  territory  and  to ensure  the  orderly  movement  of  natural  persons  across  its  borders,  provided  such measures  are  not  applied  in  a  manner  so  as  to  unduly  impair  the  benefits  accruing  to  the other  Party  or  delay  trade  in  goods  or  services  or  conduct  of  investment  activities  under this  Agreement.   \n\nSo I am unsure why the need to single out CECA. Either more people need to read the CECA and other FTAs Singapore has signed and see that assumption that this allows unfettered access by Indian nationals to the Singapore job market is false, or this singling out of CECA has been done by somebody who is simply racist / xenophobic."", 'The provision on intra-company transfers is something many of our FTAs have. And therefore shell companies, or transfer from other countries entities into the Singapore entities is something that can be done using our other FTAs too. \n\nUnsure why there is a need to single out CECA then, instead of criticizing FTAs in general. Unless the person who brought this to light is low key racist?', ""Again, this is not a provision specific to CECA. (Copying my reply here again) \n\nSimilar language on movement of natural persons in the CECA can be found in other FTAs that Singapore signed.

So what difference does ceca make in hiring an Indian professional vs for example, an Australian or Malaysian?', 'Nothing. Still have to go through MoM approval process which is same for all foreign nationalities', 'There is no fixed quota for EP. But MOM purportedly look at the ratio of EP to locals to decide if an application should be approved.', '&gt;CECA\n\nAll free trade of flows of goods and people are assumed to have the effect of lowering the labour cost and the cost of goods and services and overall, benefit the most number of people. As [Milton Friedman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk3ruapRQZk) would have put it: protectionism protects a small number of vocal beneficiaries but disadvantage the mass of consumers who would otherwise get cheaper goods and services. Locals whose jobs are displaced by cheaper labours usually will pay just as much taxes as the migrant labours but have access to welfare programs that allow them to upskill and get into better jobs.\n\nThe other part of these agreements is a free flow of capital and investment.\n\nNow, here\'s the incredibly tricky part. Anti-free trade people are almost universally against free flow of goods (putting local manufacturing out of business) and people (jobs, etc ...) but will be OK for free-flow of capitals. After all, foreigners are pouring money into our economy so what can be so wrong with that. It\'s ""free money"". However, the problem is free capital flow is usually a bigger problem than free flow of goods.\n\nLet\'s not forget that all the recessions have been a Minsky moment of deleveraging. A Minsky moment is during the time of great capital and liquidity availability, loans are cheap and interest rates are low. People go a bit crazy on taking out loans to hypothetically do business, but more often, they use it to buy assets land, real estates, bonds, etc ...) and drive up asset price. Then the party and bubble eventually ended and people and businesses go bankrupt. Alternatively, capital flight occur and people take their money and just go elsewhere. In any case, recessions are highly traumatic, painful, and disruptive.\n\nIn the Bretton-Woods system post-WWII, free trade and movement of labour were considered by Keynes as generally things but free movement of capitals isn\'t. This is something that only very recently [academics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIe05PRqKZo) have been looking at it seriously.\n\nHere\'s very expensive question: Singapore makes a huge amount of money by being a financial centre. This means free flow of capitals.\n\nIn short, anti-free-trade people are usually against the actual good thing and for the things that are actually bad.', 'education is a decade long plan, today suffers yesterdays planning', 'Which nationality has not screwed up here? I can name stupid Americans, stupid Filipinos, stupid Indians, stupid PRCs and the list goes on and on\n\nBut does that mean I blame the entire community for the actions of a few? \n\nThis is just my view la, Im not trying to change yours...just stating mine\n\nI agree with your second paragraph. The man on the street won’t know the actual benefits/detriments of such policies which is why is need reasonable opposition (WP) to ask tough, yet sensible questions to the incumbent and not fear mongering politicians who want to bank on the discontent of some citizens', '\\&gt;However, does it help if you told those retrenched by CECA that ""on the whole, Singapore benefited""? \n\nProbably not, but if companies move out SG due to regulatory environments and reduction in trade surplus and even more people lose their jobs, would it not be worse?\n\nPeople have a misconception if employed is a zero-sum game, that when 1 foreign gets a job, 1 Singaporean loses it. But the truth is quite different. When Singapore is successful at becoming a region centre - then we create more jobs. Jobs that would all move to another country in a heart-beat if quota restrictions forced companies to move.\n\nThe thing is, Singapore has almost no domestic market. We can\'t convince companies to headquarters Singapore like China. \n\nSo it is a fine balance that we have to make.\n\nWhile I can speak for all sectors. In my field (R&amp;D, artificial intelligence), every capable Singaporean I know is hired. We certain foreigners and local equal pay, and there zero incentive to hire an equally capable Foreigner over a Singaporean. But truth of it is, to rapidly expand, we need foreign EPs. The current restrictions are already getting sufficiently severe (e.g. hiring delays) that there a constant consideration moving R&amp;D somewhere else to be competitive. If we did that, lots of Singaporeans would lose their jobs.', ""I am not blaming any nationality. Just because I have doubts about a FTA, which is gov2gov, doesn't mean my displeasure extends to people from that country."", ""Yes, you are right. No published. the fixed quota for EP but MOM has been very strict recently. They even rejected/cancelled EP for the firms in 'blacklist' irrespective of how big they are.

Capable Singaporeans are paid top dollar for their work. The truth is Singapore just does not have enough local talent to support all these big MNCs and even high value startups. And it's simple- if you don't have the people and the resources, then your country is not suitable for my operations/HQ.\n\nTake Shopee as an example and the amount of jobs just waiting to be taken up. They pay very well even for entry level software Engineers."", ""&gt;Probably not, but if companies move out SG due to regulatory environments and reduction in trade surplus and even more people lose their jobs, would it not be worse?\n\nYes, and that's why regulators love signing these FTAs. But the benefits are not evenly distributed throughout society. I'm a scientist in industry, and I suspect you are too. Our ilk are (usually) globally competitive, and FTAs benefit us disproportionately. But if the tide turns, you &amp; I could easily be on the next flight out to steal another job from another local in their own country, and maybe participate in some Ramesh-like scolding of guards. The same can't be said for quite a lot of PMETs, who may not necessarily compete with the crème of EP approvals.\n\nAs in all things, some balance is needed. We can't be too tied up in the macroeconomic forest to miss the trees."", 'While what yous ay is true, Singapore disproportionately benefits from these FTAs. For country of 5 million, it has an incredible amount of R&amp;D centers, regional company headquarters etc.  All of this means that many and resources from the entire SEA region (and much of Asia-Pacific) is funnelled into Singapore. This is what is allowing Singaporeans to enjoy world-class medical care, public facilities and universities, and subsidised housing while paying some of the world\'s lowest taxes.\n\nI disagree with what you say regarding  \'""you &amp; I could easily be on the next flight out to steal another job from another local in their own country \'\'. It is true that we can fly out if R&amp;D centre shifts to say, Shenzhen. But when we do that, we would not be stealing a job from a local Shenzhener. If say I opened an R&amp;D centre there, that\'d be 8 new positions for PhD research scientists, including probably 2 locals. And then supporting them are project officers/research engineers - about 20 extra jobs, which probably 15 locals. Then human resources, another 5 - all local. And finally, all these extra international scientists will need to eat, sleep, be entertained, contributing jobs to local F&amp;B. Singapore would lose of these things at the same time.', 'I’m indian and I feel that ceca is a loophole in bringing in such highly paid Indian nationals who have dubious degrees from some far away indian University which is so so less prestigious than our local graduates .

Firstly, the HOD wears a transparent mask in office or takes them out and only uses a proper mask when exiting the office. 

People love taking out their masks during working hours.

Whenever an safety officer comes for inspection, the supervisor will be telling everyone to maintain a safe distancing and keep their mask on. Yes, there are informants to let us know when they arrive.

Sgmirror,1604753249,jpqa2s,31,1,"My friend was looking for some specific type of clothes and she found someone on a Facebook group. They invited her (by appointment) to their condo where she did the registration at gate, safeentry etc and later went to the unit and tried on a few clothes in a room and then purchased them. Payment was via PayNow.

The proprietor told her only 5 people are allowed to come in at a time and she is following all the safe distancing measures. My friend and I got into an argument when I told her that the business is illegal in all likelihood. I tried to find anything online but couldn’t see any specific content. Here are my questions:
1. Can a retail business where people need to visit and try clothes be run from a condo?
2. Shouldn’t the condo management see such high traffic to the unit and wonder what’s going on?
3. Should there be, at the very least a separate safeentry for that apartment itself for better tracing in the likelihood of an exposure?
4. Can people openly advertise such businesses on Facebook (if the know it’s illegal)?
5. Would the Admins of these Facebook groups also be complicit in assisting these illegal activities by allowing them to post their ads and content?

Exactly what the virus would want. I expected it. We have Covid fatigue.""\n\n&gt; The eight shoppers that TNP approached were confident that masking up would give them enough protection from the coronavirus that has blighted the world in the past year.\n\n&gt; One of them, who was with her husband and wanted to be known only as Ms Nancy, 58, said: ""I think it is okay and safe without social distancing because people are wearing masks.""\n\n&gt; Another shopper, Mr Hong, 47, who was with his wife and son, said: ""I am not worried because we are moving around and not trapped in one area. It is fine because people are wearing masks.""\n\n&gt; Dr Leong said while it is true that masks do provide some protection, the assumption is they are good quality masks that are used properly in tandem with strict hand hygiene.\n\n&gt; ""The mask is only as good as how you use it. Many wear it with their nose exposed and with big gaps by the side,"" he added.\n\n&gt; When approached, many shop owners and assistants either declined to comment or were defensive about the lax safety measures in the area.\n\n&gt; When asked about SafeEntry, a woman selling festive snacks kept asking if the TNP team wanted to make a purchase before she finally pointed to a neighbouring shop and said: ""There is a QR code next to our shop. It is the same if you scan next door.""\n\n&gt; At the only shop enforcing SafeEntry and temperature- taking, the owner who wanted to be known only as Mr Larry, 28, said: ""I am worried that there is no social distancing and customers are not keeping a distance from one another.""\n\n&gt; Mr Low Chek Liang, 58, who runs a shop selling Chinese New Year decorations, said: ""I am not scared even though there is no SafeEntry. If you have a strong immunity, there is nothing to be scared of. I think I have a strong immunity.""\n\n&gt; Last November, the Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng Citizens\' Consultative Committee decided to cancel the Chinese New Year bazaar over crowd control concerns.\n\n&gt; But it has done little to keep the crowds away. On Saturday, three safe distancing ambassadors told TNP about the difficulties their team of 10 faced in trying to manage the crowds.\n\n&gt; DIFFICULT\n\n&gt; ""We have to make sure everyone is 1m apart and wearing masks, but since it is a weekend, it is difficult to control them,"" said one.\n\n&gt; ""We even activated teams from Orchard and other areas to come over and help, along with assistance from police officers.\n\n&gt; ""But we really need the full cooperation of the public.""\n\n&gt; The surge in physical interactions is highly risky, warned Dr Leong.\n\n&gt; ""If we continue like this, a super spreading event will occur. What made us safe previously may not be good enough for the next lap,"" he said.\n\n&gt; Dr Leong added that while we have managed to ""push back"" the virus in recent months, if we just ""maintain status quo, we will falter"".\n\n&gt; This is because the virus is adapting into new strains that are more infectious in places such as Britain, South Africa and Brazil.\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, complacency set in here with the more relaxed measures in phase three, likely contributing to a rise in community cases, he noted.\n\n&gt; Dr Leong expects a spike after the festive celebrations as ""we have a coming together of a perfect storm. Big gatherings, more transmissible virus, Covid fatigue"".\n\n&gt; Warning that the virus was ""coming back with a vengeance"" in several countries, he said: ""The vengeance reeked of death, illness and misery in Manaus, Brazil.\n\n&gt; ""They are having \'Covid deja vu\'.\n\n&gt; ""One circuit breaker (in Singapore) is one too many.

Hi everyone, was wondering how the seating arrangement at NLB (LKC reference library lv 7-11) is like now. I understand that because of COVID there has been differences to entry such as booking of seats. 

However, I’m keen to know if we can still sit side by side with friends or is there alternate sitting due to safe distancing?

liquidatedmyass,1624926925,o9x82f,135,1,"Hey all, been a lurker over the past few years and this being my first post.

Currently serving my ICT with my unit amidst the COVID pandemic and I’ve noticed the huge lack of social distancing measures taken when it comes to in camp training. 

My unit is stay in, and although a swab test is done, we’re still tasked to stay in close proximity bed with a lack of enforcement in wearing masks in bunk (which would be redundant and hard to enforce if we all had to sleep with masks on), while moving to/from the showers and training (route march, IPPT etc; strenuous activities that require us to keep our masks off while in close proximity to one another) before any of the test results are out. If one of us tested positive, will the whole battalion get quarantined?

Training schedules and fall ins are still mandatory, with crowds of people in close proximity with each other. Smoking points are still often filled with groups gathering amongst themselves. 

With the current pandemic, any of these sorts of gathering in public would be swiftly dispersed by safe distancing officers and videos taken of such gatherings often gather much scrutiny on online media - we simply aren’t talking more about the situation in ICTs given that we’re not able to take in camp pictures and precautions from MINDEF are clearly reckless and insufficient given the current global situation. 

Given the daily reports of an uptrend in daily cases locally and internationally from the Delta variant, I’m deeply concerned over our readiness to deal with a potential COVID cluster from ICT training, and am baffled by our lack of measures and where our priorities lie when it comes to keeping our military operationally ready by simply cancelling ICT trainings until the COVID situation gets better.

If what you describe is the situation at all camps nationwide, having no clusters pop up isn't a miracle, but a testament to our infection control measures. Our population is highly vaccinated today, which removes a significant portion of virus hosts out of the pool. Regular testing ensures asymptomatic cases are detected, and even if (touch wood) a case leaks through, the symptoms will be nonexistent or minor for vaccinated people. Furthermore, the vast majority of activities at ICT are outdoors, where less than 1% of global transmissions occur.\n\nAround the world, countries with high vaccination rates have begun allowing outdoor social activities such as exercise, hiking, and others. All this is done with hospitalizations and deaths being stable or declining. The message I take away isn't that the SAF is being too reckless, but that the civilian government is being too conservative regarding their reopening protocols. The current COVID situation is far, far better than it was 6 months ago, with over half the population having received at least one dose of the vaccine and hospitals easily handling the case load. Rather than live in the past, we need to plan towards a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe SAF is acting as if the threat of the virus is lower than the threat of foreign invasion, which is pretty close to zero to start with. While I don't agree with that mindset, the fact is that with high vaccination rates, the virus doesn't pose a significant danger to our community or medical system. It is an eventuality that a serviceperson will contract the virus, but as we exit the crisis, we shouldn't fear it any more than the flu."", 'Have u tried raising this up to ur OC/direct superior?

But it made no sense as after every day book out you don't know what all the Nsmen do outside and could get infected afterwards."", 'I did my ICT a few months ago as a KAH. I agree that the situation is less than ideal (for both training and COVID prevention), but let me share the measures in place and the difficulties we faced on the ground. Note that things may have changed since March this year.\n\nWhen you report to camp, you are supposed to remain 1m apart from everyone until your swab test results come in on day 2. However, this is really difficult to achieve as space is limited in camp. Everyone should be responsible and distance yourself even when nobody is looking, but we all know what happens. The alternative is to force everyone to go for a swab test the day before you report for your ICT, but this will be a huge challenge unless SAF100 is issued for the day. Even then, it will be a logistical nightmare. After your swab test results come in, everyone is assumed to be COVID-free (we all know it\'s not 100%, but that\'s as good as it gets for now), and training can commence.\n\nThe entire company/brigade is split into multiple small groups of around 20 pax. These Functional Groups (FGs) are not supposed to interact with each other and have to stay at least 1m apart from other groups at all times. Some people (KAHs, trainers, admin staff) are considered ""transient"" as they do not stay with the groups permanently, and are allowed to move between groups when required while ensuring appropriate distancing. This is actually a huge pain when it comes to the planning and conducting of the ICT. But if you think about it, groups of 20 pax is actually safer than schools and weddings and other events where up to 50 pax are allowed to congregate without pre-event testing.\n\nBunks, toilets and common areas. Bunks are pre-assigned (according to FGs), toilets are allocated to FGs (IIRC, up to 2 FGs can share a toilet), and different groups are even supposed to use different staircases. All these are meant to reduce contact with other FGs. The efficacy of these measures are debatable as most people don\'t strictly follow the rules (especially for staircases), but it really is up to personal responsibility and the command and control by your KAHs.\n\nMask off trainings (physically strenuous activities - IPPT, training that requires SBO, etc) are also split into smaller groups (usually within your FG), 2.4km runs are flagged off in small waves, etc. Again, the effectiveness of these really depend on how strictly your KAHs adhere to the rules and plan the activities. But if you feel that there are lapses or things that don\'t make sense, please do sound out to your superiors as the KAHs sometimes really can\'t see everything that goes on in the ground.\n\nPersonally, I felt that the measures are decent enough, although they need to be strictly enforced to be effective. Even on the rare occasion when multiple FGs come into closer contact during ICT, it\'s usually not more than 2-3 FGs (platoon level), or around the 50 pax mark. Coupled with PCR tests (more accurate than rapid antigen tests for weddings/events), it does significantly lower the risks of spreading. I would say these rules are actually pretty much comparable with the rules for public events.', 'It is the same word, of course it rhymes', 'Lmao.

waffleboy92,1621234266,ne90k7,26,1,"&gt;At a media conference by the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force, Mr Chan noted that some of the new mutations of the coronavirus are “much more virulent” and “seem to attack the younger children”.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The B1617 strain appears to affect children more,** said Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung, citing the ministry’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak.

This line stuck out to me when I read the news release. Is this really true?

It is true that the new strain is more infectious. 

However, it is also true that we have vaccinated a significant bulk of our elderly since the last circuit breaker. Naturally, this will cause a reduction in **detectable cases** for the elderly, given the same rate of spread. (Confirmation bias -&gt; You count positive cases where the person is already vaccinated, but you won't know who got exposed to the virus and didn't get affected in the end and show a negative COVID test)

I'm inclined to think the strain **isn't specifically more impactful to kids**, it's just a combination of the older gen being vaccinated --&gt; less cases, + new strain being more infectious +  a lot harder to enforce safe distancing for kids that is the reason for the strain 'affecting kids more'

derpmeow,1621231876,ne8e4w,11,1,"Up until recently COVID was thought to be spread mostly via droplets. However within the last month the WHO [(on 30th April)](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions) and the USA CDC [(on 7th May)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/sars-cov-2-transmission.html) have updated their guidelines to include airborne spread of COVID. 

A quick distinction between droplet and aerosols: ""Respiratory droplets are &gt;5-10 μm in diameter whereas droplets &lt;5μm in diameter are referred to as droplet nuclei or aerosols...Airborne transmission is defined as the spread of an infectious agent caused by the dissemination of droplet nuclei (aerosols) that remain infectious when suspended in air over **long distances and time**."" (Source WHO guidelines linked above, emphasis mine)

What this means for us: **masks and 1 metre distancing may not be enough**. To be sure, masks and safe distancing will help *reduce* spread, as they did last year. Even during aerosol-generating procedures like intubation masks reduce risk as in [this case](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/L20-0175) in CGH last year (no HCW infected though most only wore surgical masks). But in the face of potentially more virulent variants of concern, I submit that further measures are needed. Let me compare to another airborne disease - measles. Measles aerosols stay in the air for 2 hours and can spread across a stadium or in a plane (both proven in case studies). Now, sars-cov-2 is not measles, but that should give an idea of how bloody infectious aerosols can be. We should be more concerned with *ventilation* and fresh air flow. Diluting aerosols with fresh air helps reduce viral load received and risk of infection (the incidence of outdoor spread of COVID is &lt;1%). 

So what does this mean for SG? **Open a window. Turn on a fan.** You can keep the AC so we don't all die of heatstroke, but at least get some fresh air flow  going. If you must for whatever reason still be in a group, for essential work or whatever, take it outdoors.

I am waiting for updated guidelines from the govt, but weeeeell that might be a while, and anyway other countries (UK, NZ, AUS) haven't updated theirs either. But i wanted to put this out there because let's face it we're an aircon and indoors-mostly country, which i think makes us more susceptible in certain ways.

JCYK95,1621086849,nczehv,103,1,"Hi everyone, I am feeling rather distressed so please forgive me if I'm not explaining myself properly. I don't know where to turn to, to get some advice. So i thought maybe someone here could help.

My situation is as follows. I apologise in advance for the wall of text.

My dad (61), who has been clinically diagnosed with Dementia and sorely lacks mental capacity, was arrested while out of the house alone, by 2 police officers. The reason for arrest was because he was not wearing a mask, and I was informed by the investigating officer (IO) that my dad was being uncooperative.

My dad has in his wallet, a safe return card from National Council of Social Services (NCSS) that basically functions as an indication to law enforcement officers that my dad is someone who has special needs and lacks mental capacity, thus he may not comply with safety measures like social distancing and wearing of masks.

However, it seems that the police officers did not bother to assess my dad's condition before making the arrest. The officers did note that my dad appeared confused, as he could not answer what the time of day was, or what day of the week it was.

I later found an out of context video of my dad getting arrested, circulating around on social media and published in a news website as well. The video was taken by a bystander, who clearly did not understand the context of what was happening.

I am extremely distressed by this. Seeing the way my dad, an elderly person of special needs, was being roughly handled by the police despite his verbal pleas for help, and seeing the extremely out of context video posted to social media and local news websites with all the derogatory comments made about him.

My dad has sustained some injuries. Bruises and cuts to his body from being arrested by the police. Thankfully, it is nothing more than that.

Additionally, a very similar incident has occurred before in the past, also involving the police where they arrested my dad without understanding that he has dementia. So this makes it the second time that such an event has occured.

In view of this, I would like to ask for some advice. What should I do?

I strongly feel that the police, from both cases, are a threat to my dad's well being and safety. Which is ironic and alarming, because my dad is an elderly lacking in mental capacity, which means he is one of the most vulnerable members of our society. Yet from my perspective and experience, the police has only brought harm to my dad, instead of protecting a vulnerable person like him. I had thought that this would be a one-off incident, but now that it has happened twice, what's to say that it will not happen for the third, or fourth time. And, what if on the third time, the altercation with the police results in a serious or even fatal injury to my dad. I can only conclude that the police officers on the ground are a danger to my father.

Secondly, there's the video of my dad's arrest being circulated in social media. It is extremely out of context, and extremely damaging to my dad. The video does not show at all that my dad has dementia and so it comes across as an arrest of an unruly uncle. Ultimately, i would like to have it removed, for the sake of my father's dignity and given that he has dementia, I would like to have his privacy protected. But i am unsure as to whether to make contact with the original poster of the video and the news websites. Would i be exposing myself or my family to greater risks? what do i do?

All in all, I can only feel that there is extreme injustice done towards my dad. From the way the police handled him, to the videos circulating online.

It doesn’t mean that tomorrow there won’t be a new set of circumstances arising which poses a new set of challenges for him. \n\nSecond, pushing this on to the police is a deflection from the first issue. The police can’t be expected to know he has dementia. Even if he has dementia but he’s acting in a threatening or violent way, it doesn’t mean he gets to be treated with kids gloves. Police also need to protect themselves. As someone else pointed out, they can’t know if the person is high on drugs or drunk or suffers from mental illness.

In the 1970s, the Ministry of Health decided on setting up training programs in Singapore in all medical and surgical disciplines. The specialist training committee for psychiatry was established to oversee psychiatry training in Singapore, and the first trainees were recruited in 1983. The university awarded a master of medicine (Psychiatry) degree, and specialist recognition was by the specialist accreditation board in Singapore. The training program was largely based on requirements of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the UK. It was initially 3 years and then extended to 5 years. The first 3 years was called basic specialist training, and trainees were expected to complete the master of medicine (psychiatry) examination in year 3. The remaining two years was for advanced specialist training, and the candidates sat for an exit examination consisting of a journal critique, clinical vignette, and a topical case discussion at the end of it.”\n\nAlso, a source directly from MOH (2018-2019) : https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/the-median-waiting-time-to-see-psychiatrists-and-clinical-psychologists\n\n“There are around 248[4] psychiatrists and 473[5] psychologists practicing in Singapore, which translates to 4.4 psychiatrists and 8.3[6] psychologists per 100k population.”\n\nAlso psychiatrists/psychologists to population ratio might be an indicator of how good or bad the mental health system is of a country but it’s not a deciding factor.

&amp;#x200B;

This evening, I was walking from the National Library to Raffles City when I saw a Caucasian man walking with his wife and son. 

&amp;#x200B;

He was not wearing his mask properly ( the mask did not cover his nose and mouth). 

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking that he might have simply forgotten to mask up after eating/drinking, I walked over and said gently but firmly “Sir, please wear your mask properly.”

&amp;#x200B;

The response: “Yea, what is it to you?” His wife shook her head at me. He did put on his mask properly though. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a medical student who is aware of the fact that his behaviour could kill people.

&amp;#x200B;

I waited for the traffic light to turn green. 

&amp;#x200B;

While waiting, I looked back and saw that he had removed the mask again. I strode over and asked him to put his mask back on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Him: “What the fuck is wrong with you?

Do you know who I am?”

&amp;#x200B;

Me: “I don’t care who you are.”

&amp;#x200B;

Him: “xxx...GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY AND LEAVE ME ALONE! DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?!”

&amp;#x200B;

His wife: “LEAVE US ALONE! ONE METRE SOCIAL DISTANCING RIGHT? GO AWAY! (Proceeds to make a swatting motion with her hands at me)” 

&amp;#x200B;

Me: “I AM IN MY COUNTRY!”

&amp;#x200B;

Him: “WHAT DID YOU DARE TO SAY TO ME...(spews vulgarities and shouts nonsensical statements)”

&amp;#x200B;

It was the first time I’ve encountered such ugly behaviour that left me shocked and literally shaking in anger.

We have all longed for this moment, when we can get back to some sense of normalcy.”\n\n&gt; Some exceptions\n\n&gt; However, this is not a blanket rule as there are settings where masks still have to be worn.\n\n&gt; These include having to wear masks on airplanes, buses, trains and other public transportation, as well as in a health-care setting or at a business that requires face masks, Walensky also said.\n\n&gt; However, unvaccinated people should still continue to wear masks, she added.\n\n&gt; She said these individuals remain at risk of mild or severe illness, death, and risk of spreading the disease to others.\n\n&gt; People with compromised immune systems should speak with their doctor before giving up their masks, she also said.\n\n&gt; She added there is always a chance the CDC could change its guidance again if the Covid-19 pandemic worsens or additional variants emerge.\n\n&gt; White House announces plan ahead of July 4th celebrations\n\n&gt; The announcement from the CDC comes just ahead of the Memorial Day and Fourth of July parade season.\n\n&gt; President Joe Biden has said he hopes to see enough Americans vaccinated by Independence Day to safely hold outdoor gatherings.\n\n&gt; The goal was to get 70 per cent of U.S. adults to receive at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and having 160 million adults fully vaccinated by July 4.\n\n&gt; As of May 12, more than 151 million Americans age 18 and older, or 58.7 per cent of the U.S. adult population, have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.\n\n&gt; Top photo via The White House\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)', 'How to know in the street if a guy is vaccined or not?', ""Good move by Biden.\n\nCarrot on stick to get ppl to be vaccinated.

&gt;Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the US, stated that the two-metre rule was originally developed when the prevailing belief was that Covid-19 transmission occurred solely through heavier droplets projected from the mouth and nose during speech, coughing, and sneezing, CTVnews.ca reported.

&gt;  
&gt;However, scientists have now been increasingly speaking about the role of aerosols, smaller particles that linger in the air longer, in Covid-19 transmission.

&gt;  
&gt;“The importance of airborne transmission of Covid-19 is now widely recognised,” researchers, including Martin Z Bazant, from the varsity’s Department of Chemical Engineering, were quoted as saying.  
&gt;  
&gt;The study, published in the journal PNAS, showed that the amount of time that it is safe to spend in an indoor space depends on a number of factors, such as face-mask usage, the size of the space and the amount of ventilation, the report said.  
&gt;  
&gt;“To minimise risk of infection, one should avoid spending extended periods in highly populated areas,” the researchers stated.  
&gt;  
&gt;“One is safer in rooms with large volume and high ventilation rates. One is at greater risk in rooms where people are exerting themselves in such a way as to increase their respiration rate and pathogen output, for example, by exercising, singing, or shouting,” they added.  
&gt;  
&gt;The team developed a theoretical model based on airborne transmission that offers an understanding of how long can an uninfected person be safe in an indoor location with an infected person.  
&gt;  
&gt;They also looked at how different respiratory activities, such as singing, speaking, and breathing, contributed to the overall amount of exhaled particles, and thus the potential amount of pathogens expelled.

It looks like the control measures we implemented here in Singapore 2020 are going to be insufficient if the Indian Variant of the mutation makes a foothold in Singapore.

Since WHO also recently acknowledged that COVID is indeed airborne ( according to a Time report on 04MAY21), the most effective measure would be to stay away from crowded areas.

Safety Distance, mask-wearing, etc. might not suffice when it comes to eliminating the risks of contracting the virus.

The police were called in, said the ministry, adding that police assistance had been required for more than 10 cases on Monday (April 13).\n\n&gt; About the same number of composition fines had also been issued the day before (April 12), when the stiffer penalties for such breaches kicked in.\n\n&gt; On both days, fines were issued to people who were loitering, or using areas that had been cordoned or closed off , the ministry said.\n\n&gt; ""This included a group playing in the Tanjong Rhu open field, a small group playing tennis at the closed Tanglin Tennis Academy, and (a group playing) baseball in a closed private field at Tanglin Rugby Club,"" said the MEWR spokesman.\n\n&gt; During the circuit breaker period, schools and most workplaces will remain closed until May 4 to stem the spread of Covid-19 in Singapore. People have also been urged to leave their homes only for essential activities, such as buying food.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; A small group playing tennis at the closed Tanglin Tennis Academy. PHOTO: MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND WATER RESOURCES\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Minister of the Environment and Water Resources, said in a Facebook post on Monday that there have been many queries on what can or cannot be done during this period.\n\n&gt; ""My answer to them is that there is a law to abide by, but it is our love for our families, friends and fellow Singaporeans that should guide our actions,"" he said.\n\n&gt; Mr Masagos said he had called his mother to explain why he should not meet her in person. ""Because of my work I may expose her unwittingly to this deadly virus. And I will never forgive myself if I did,"" he wrote in the post.\n\n&gt; ""The remaining 21 days are a critical window that will determine if we can successfully flatten the curve, prevent large-scale community spread, and save our loved ones.""\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, a Straits Times check at Velocity in Novena around noon on Monday found that while there was still a lunchtime crowd visiting the mall to take away food from eateries, human traffic was considerably diminished.\n\n&gt; At West Coast Park, individuals and small family groups of parents and children were seen strolling, jogging or exercising at about 6pm. No one was seen loitering around the rest areas, except for one elderly man, who was sipping a drink on a bench.\n\n&gt; Dr Leong Chee Chiew, commissioner of parks and recreation at the National Parks Board, said most parks and gardens managed by the Board saw low to moderate visitorship levels.\n\n&gt; But different parts of Singapore\'s green spaces had to be progressively closed to allow for safe distancing and prevent groups from gathering, especially during peak periods.\n\n&gt; Those visiting these areas to walk, jog and cycle by themselves or with individuals from the same household should practice safe distancing measures and return to their homes once done, he said.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; At West Coast Park, individuals and small family groups of parents and children were seen strolling, jogging or exercising at about 6pm.

A nation in isolation

Yet we are still queuing

People keep gathering, got massive crowds outside

Couldn't keep them in, gahmen knows we tried...

Must distancing

Must let them know

Well now they know....

All the texts go on

Saves both the old and small

And the risk of COVID19

Only Grab and Panda riders are around

And one call is all we need for food delivery

I'm never going back, except to do the trash!!!

   * They should dine alone and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual, and not share tables with other individuals.

gentle reminder that staying home isnt just for your own sake. It’s for the people you love as well. Stay home for their sake. If you catch the virus ye you may say u arent afraid but what if you cause the people you love to come down with the virus also? Especially the older people you have at home like your parents. No big deal if you catch it but if you pass it to someone vulnerable you put them at risk of dying from the virus and if shit really happens i hope you r ready for that. Or worse if you getting the virus indirectly led to someone else’s death because you went out. (True story from the imported case who went to hero’s and indirectly caused one of the deaths at the crickets club. It could seriously have been prevented)

Also i just wna say that for many people their homes isn’t their safe space so maybe that’s why they have to hang out at the parks. So for those who have their homes as their safe spaces, please stay at home as much as possible when you can and leave the parks for those who really need it. I know you want to get out for fresh air coz cooping at home can be suffocating but in trying times like these try to be considerate and just really go out if you really must. 

Like what pm said, every one of us is literally at the frontline now. We must play our part to contain this. Do it for the people you love if you cant do it for yourself. Go out only if you must. If not just stay at home and tahan it. The faster we do it right, the faster our normal lives can resume. Lets all do our part because it’s really not about us anymore. It’s about everyone as a whole.

ZeroPauper,1586512251,fycxhb,170,1,"Yes I get it, cooping ourselves up at home is depressing, suffocating and boring. A small minority of us face legitimate issues such as domestic abuse &amp; mental issues, but for the overwhelming majority the choice between death and boredom should be a simple one (For those who want to argue that it's an exaggeration, please educate yourself with how other badly hit countries are faring). I would say that a majority of us are doing our part by staying at home but it's not enough, everyone has to play a part. 

We have to face the facts, COVID-19 isn't going to magically disappear unless we take drastic measures. The only effective way to combat COVID-19 in its accelerating phase is to isolate everyone from each other, it has been proven in Italy and China where their curve is slowly flattening. 

This is a extremely unpopular opinion in this sub, but I will still say it: The only reasons you should leave your house are: You're working an essential job, you need groceries/food, you need medical help. The crowding at wet markets and supermarkets is understandable, given that we all need food to sustain ourselves. Some measures that we can take to reduce congestion at markets:  

* Boosting grocery delivering services (or making it free altogether)
* Mindset shift of people who cook to shift towards simple foods that can last long (E.g. frozen meat &amp; veg, pasta, canned food, pasteurized eggs)
* Doing an Italy and limiting grocery runs per household
* Helping wet markets set up delivery orders

&amp;#x200B;

If it's still not clear after reading the above, maybe we should take a look at some case studies.

Many took the opportunity to go out ""one last time"" to meet their friends. The effects of such actions will be clearer in the coming weeks.

# Abusing loopholes 

I wish I could give everyone the benefit of doubt and say that they're just trying to find workarounds to make their lives more ""normal"" and they're not actively looking for loopholes. But the evidence against that is overwhelming. People are finding every single excuse to leave their houses.

Allowing people to exercise has resulted in the opposite effect from preventing people from gathering. Suddenly everyone is a marathon runner and heading to parks to run. Regular joggers have mentioned that they've seen a sharp increase in unfamiliar faces in parks, also families with kids and elderly strolling around. 

# Children [no longer allowed](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/covid-19-children-should-not-be-shuttled-grandparents-home-daily-basis-during-circuit?fbclid=IwAR0VjrJLCz_PfcKC7gUXOpRdNBMp0A-gemLyuFgnfkecc6QVbMArkGco6-w) to be dropped off daily at grandparents’ home

The official reason was to ""protect the elderly"", but I'm sure it's pretty obvious what caused the crackdown on this. Non-essential workers who can't handle their own kids (i'm not saying it's easy to handle kids while working but there are parents who can handle it well) that abused the system, now essential workers with kids have to suffer at the hands of irresponsible non-essential workers.

(Photo: Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources)\n\n&gt; Authorities will also patrol areas where people have been seen loitering and ""sitting for hours"" at night, it added.\n\n&gt; Addressing the issue on Facebook, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli urged members of the public to stay home.\n\n&gt; ""Our enforcement officers are still finding people, young and old, gathering in groups day and night on the second day of our circuit breaker,"" he said.\n\n&gt; ""Exercise groups are still meeting in the parks.

These are where clusters of infections can be born.""\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Although fewer advisories were issued on Wednesday compared to the more than 7,000 on Tuesday, this was only because groups dispersed when told to do so, said the minister.\n\n&gt; ""The point is that there are still so many gatherings in public places. This is very worrying,"" he said.\n\n&gt; He implored members of the public to adhere to the elevated safe distancing measures, warning that the authorities would deal seriously with those found breaching them.\n\n&gt; ""From tomorrow, if enforcement officers come across persons gathered in public, they will issue them written warnings immediately, before dispersing them,"" he added. ""Subsequent infringements will incur a fine or prosecution in court.""\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; CROWD MANAGEMENT MEASURES EXPANDED TO INCLUDE MORE MARKETS\n\n&gt; Crowd management measures will be expanded to cover around half of all markets in Singapore by Friday to control the spread of COVID-19, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said in a news release on Wednesday.\n\n&gt; Fifteen markets have put in crowd management measures like controlled entry and exit points as of Wednesday.\n\n&gt; These measures will now be rolled out to include 25 other markets which are “relatively popular and would attract crowds especially on weekends”, NEA said.\n\n&gt; The agency explained that the number of people who can enter a market at any time is determined by the market\'s size and available space. If a queue forms when the market\'s capacity is reached, NEA advised that people should also keep a 1m distance from each other when waiting to enter the market.\n\n&gt; “With more persons telecommuting during this period, and in view of the coming long weekend, members of the public should adjust their marketing hours,” NEA said.\n\n&gt; It suggested visiting markets once a week, or during weekdays when markets are less crowded. If patrons must visit on weekends, they are encouraged to avoid the peak period between 7.30am and 10am.\n\n&gt; NEA also said vulnerable groups like the elderly should avoid visiting markets altogether and seek help from family or neighbours.\n\n&gt; ENFORCEMENT ACTION TAKEN AT PUBLIC PLACES\n\n&gt; Enforcement actions were also taken at some markets and the cooked food sections of hawker centres against those not adhering to safe distancing rules.\n\n&gt; Over the morning and lunch hour on Wednesday, 307 written advisories were issued to patrons at markets to keep a safe distance between one another when making purchases at stalls.\n\n&gt; Written advisory being issued to a patron at a market in Jurong West.

4. Getting people to stay home
5. Travel restrictions
6. Quarantine

Singaporeans have been [touting ""safe distancing"" as a gold standard](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-safe-distancing-rules-kick-in-failure-to-sit-or-queue-1m-apart-from-others) for the reduction of COVID-19 spread since March 26. Many Singaporeans also view the ""1m apart rule"" along with wearing masks as the *bulletproof* option to stay safe from the disease. Over the weekend, people who queued at the [supermarkets](https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/SINGAPORE-_VIRUS-_QUE0505_1586053935.jpg), [IKEA](https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/ikeasdas_1586142329.jpg), [Popular](https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12609998/16x9/768/432/b1dd975e01f8e137b59a4657688d005c/hx/popular-novena.jpg) and [Toys""R""us](https://i.redd.it/26gtu2at8yq41.jpg) justified that their actions do not endanger public health as a whole, because they've been practicing the ""1m apart rule"" and wearing masks. However, the CB has kicked in starting from today and the focus has shifted to getting people to stay at home, which in my opinion is a much better preventive method than the ""1m apart rule"".

# In this post, I question the mentality of using the ""1m apart rule"" as the main justification of selfish public actions.

Studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can travel at least 4.5m away[\[1\]](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3074351/coronavirus-can-travel-twice-far-official-safe-distance-and-stay), normal speech also yields large quantities of viral particles[\[2\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-38808-z).

The following [MIT article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852) states that not only sneezes, and coughs can produce a 'turbulent gas cloud' of viral particles but also normal expiration(breathing) :

&gt;*""Although such social distancing strategies are critical in the current time of pandemic, it may seem surprising that the current understanding of the routes of host-to-host transmission in respiratory infectious diseases are predicated on a model of disease transmission developed in the 1930s that, by modern standards, seems overly simplified. Implementing public health recommendations based on these older models may limit the effectiveness of the proposed interventions.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""Recent work has demonstrated that exhalations, sneezes, and coughs not only consist of mucosalivary droplets following short-range semiballistic emission trajectories but, importantly, are primarily made of a multiphase turbulent gas (a puff) cloud that entrains ambient air and traps and carries within it clusters of droplets with a continuum of droplet sizes ""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""Peak exhalation speeds can reach up to 33 to 100 feet per second (10-30 m/s), creating a cloud that can span approximately 23 to 27 feet (7-8 m). ""*

We also know that the virus can survive in aerosol for up to 3 hours, plastic and stainless steel for 72 hours, cardboard for 24 hours and copper for 4 hours[\[3\]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v2.full.pdf).

Searching for journal articles presenting data on the effectiveness of the ""1m apart rule"" yielded nothing. Most of the social distancing articles talked about closing schools, banning gatherings and getting people to stay at home[\[4\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3372334/) [\[5\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3226987/) [\[6\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3291415/)[\[7\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-9-117).

I found a [1970s OSHA Occupational Safety and Health Act](https://www.osha.gov/Publications/influenza_pandemic.html) that suggests a 2m apart rule, and the [WHO website](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) that suggests a 1m apart rule:

&gt;**Maintain social distancing**  
&gt;  
&gt;Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Why?** When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.

Both sources seem to be badly outdated given what we know with the latest research.

*Processing gif akqjle6v6dr41...*

**In conclusion, I suggest that the ""1m apart rule"" combined with mask wearing should not be taken as the first and most important method of reducing spread, but instead to be taken as a last resort method to protect yourself in the case of emergencies where you will be encountering people in a public area (E.g. buying of groceries when you run out). The most important and effective strategy is to stay at home and limit contact.**",singapore,226739,"Have we as a nation been understanding ""Social distancing"" wrongly?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fwhi08/have_we_as_a_nation_been_understanding_social/,"['yes', 'Yeah before the CB I found social distancing flawed in practice because of how densely populated we are.

deaddontopen,1586124127,fvmd98,21,11,"The Circuit Breaker can be stressful or anxiety-inducing for some people, myself included. For myself, being out everyday isn't really a matter of choice, and in fact was encouraged by my therapist as the most ideal way to deal with my current situation (that was before the whole COVID-19 outbreak). But for now, staying home is the socially responsible thing to do.

For those in the same boat as me, here are some tips I hope can ease your stress or anxiety during this period:

1. Read up on mental health coping tips online. 

A good place to start would be the US CDC's guide on [Mental Health and Coping During COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html).


2. If you need to talk to someone, the Singapore Government is setting up a [dedicated Covid-19 hotline offering emotional support](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/government-to-set-up-covid-19-hotline-offering-emotional-support). 

I'll update this post with more details once the hotline is set up.


3. There are other mental health support hotlines that should be available during this period too. A list is available on [HealthHub](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/support-groups-and-others/20/call-on-these-when-you-need-help).

One very important number to note is the Samaritans of Singapore hotline at 1800-221-4444.  


4. Check out important links and things to do on the r/Singapore [COVID-19 pinned post](https://reddit.app.link/DHtf2sZMr5).  


5. At home, when dealing with abusive or toxic relationships, consider whether it would be worthwhile to fix these broken relationships or to try to avoid contact with the person as much as possible. While no one including me can make this choice for you, please do seek a mental health professional's advice before proceeding.  


6. If you have the budget, sign up for streaming services and make a list of all the shows you want to watch. Try to focus on options that will make you happy or those that help improve your life. It's also the perfect time to sign up for one-month trials of these streaming services.  

If paying for streaming services isn't an option, consider free NLB e-books &amp; magazines on [Libby/OverDrive](https://nlb.overdrive.com) and PressReader. Of course, podcasts and YouTube are a great free way to pass time too.  


7. If you have more money, consider investing in a pair of active noise cancelling headphones because it will help you block out external noise and distractions.  


8. Go out for walks at your park or help shop for groceries and essentials. Fresh air and a change of atmosphere, no matter how short, helps in improving your mood. Do remember to practice safe distancing, wear a mask and check the apps to ensure your public park or shopping mall isn't crowded when you head out.    


9. If you really can't stay at home, especially if your safety is concerned, consider volunteer roles that help the community during this period. One option I can think of is the [SG Clean Ambassadors Network](https://form.gov.sg/#!/5e7484a2ca6a010011862c59). You can also go to [SG Cares Volunteer Page](http://www.volunteer.sg) to see more volunteer roles. If you want to earn some extra cash, I think applying for roles such as food delivery rider would be of great help during this time as there would be lots of demand.


This list isn't meant to be exhaustive and I hope the community can contribute some points as well.

90rporgohome,1585922585,fu8yai,2,1,"Some students said the closure of jc/schools was cool and all but I honestly want the reopen of schools... I have legit no idea how am I going to rely on 1 month's worth of recorded lectures and live tutorials as they seemed extremely uninteresting, unproductive, and most importantly, not gaining any much information/knowledge as much as we are in the classroom/lecture theatre environment, resulting in the lack of knowledge that was supposed to be taught by our teachers in classrooms. A Levels is already extremely tough for students in a well-studying environment, let alone students doing HBL. There is in no way that HBL will be able to replace the classroom-teaching environment because the right learning style is so drastically changed.

Indeed, you are right to say that we have no other choice and this is the only best alternative method to prevent the spread of the virus. However, there is also a need to understand the situation of the graduating students. I don't think this is a good tradeoff as their grades will be compromised. 

Furthermore, the cancelling of MYE will mean that graduating students will not be familiar to the actual examination format. This will create panic and anxiety when it comes to the actual A Level examination as they do not have enough experience in the examination settings for the students. The cancellation will also mean that students do not have a rough gauge on how well they can score in an exact replica of the A Level examination. They only have prelims, and that is it, A levels is next.

Hence, I suggest that another alternative method I have devised is that instead of letting the whole student population to do HBL, I think that allowing graduating students to go back to school would be a great option as firstly, there will be less students in schools, and secondly, their learning will be the least affected. After all, the measures put in placed such as social distancing and wipedown were kind of successful, as our education minister said there were no transmissions in schools.

annihilated02,1597937953,idclnd,11,1,"i’ve never actually felt part of my JC, despite there being school events like inter house games and various class bonding efforts. i feel like the main problem is my class because they’re really very clique-y and the IP students tend to mingle with their own kind while the JAE students like myself are left to find new friends in a completely foreign environment. Sure I did have some IP friends in JC1 but they always prioritise their friends over myself, and it’s not just one or two but it’s practically all of them.. It’s really quite sad to see that even after all the effort that I’ve tried to put into making friends in this school, these friendships never last. My only source of support is probably my CCA friends but given the COVID situation, CCA step down happened really early and so I naturally don’t get to see my CCA friends much. It’s really tiring to have to go to class everyday and have a whole anxiety attack every time the tutor says “get into a group” and I’ll end up working alone anyway. Worse still, because of safe-distancing regulations we have to sit in register order and it just happens that I’m seated literally in the middle of a clique that I’m not part of. It just sucks to have to deal with this every single day and every lesson. My form teacher is essentially useless as well because he does all the unnecessary things like being anal about reporting time and classroom cleanliness but doesn’t give a shit about class dynamics. and the fact that I’m super introverted doesn’t help because i feel like it’s too late to start trying to fit into my class (and previous attempts have been futile) this has been a really troubling issue that’s been on my mind for the longest time but i’ve never had the chance to talk to anyone about it because of all the above friendship issues. Also heard that counsellors tend to rat u out to your teachers and I really don’t want that to happen which might make my class distance from me even more so I haven’t gone for counselling at all.

i can’t turn to my family to talk about this either because my mom takes every opportunity to turn something into a life lesson and a lecture and the last thing i want is someone who’s already observing me closely to watch me like a hawk everyday. my dad is pretty much apathetic to most things, he gives lukewarm responses and i see no value in telling him about my issues

please help i’m quite desperate and I really can’t deal with this anymore given that prelims are next week and I’ve been so troubled by this that I can’t even focus while studying.. I really hate that I got put into this class and i don’t know how i can cope with this for the next 3months

Counsellors are not trying to destroy you, they want to help you, not tell the whole world. In fact you might be able to insist them to make everything secret, before you disclose your worries. It will definitely be slightly awkward at first but these people are trained to listen to your problems and give good suggestions, better than the advice you can get from Reddit :)\n\nYou seem super worried about everyone seemingly out there to get you. One thing I've discovered during my JC years was that people never actively try to put you down (they have better things to do!) Don't assume people hate you before they get to know you well.

But what I found is that when I reached university in a course I liked (computing), more of the people I knew tend to be the nerdy computer-liking type and it was much easier to click with friends, compared to back in JC (my class was more of the sporty type).

And yes I think normally the counsellor will work with the teachers so they'll probably inform them.

skyisshadesofblue,1595318518,hv3fuc,15,0,"Just received an email in the morning stating that I have to go back to class FT starting from 3rd August. 

Honestly not sure how this is going to work out. Are we going to have combined lectures ( 2 classes) or individual lectures (1 class ). If we're having combined lectures, how are we going to practice safe distancing? We're having tutorial sessions in class rn and the class just nice fits ard 20 students with safe distancing between the tables. Considering this, individual lectures seems more likely but the downside is that it will increase the workload of the lecturers ( who are already overworked lol ).

There's another possibility that the sch will hold mass lectures in lecture halls, but I'm not sure if this is will be effective for our learning. It will be harder to ask the lecturer questions and the lecturer might change as well as some of the classes have different lecturers. 

Tbh, I'm just really frustrated with SP for changing our timetables N times since the start of this sem. At first it was 100% hbl, then we have to come back to class for tutorials and practical.

As Os, Ns, and As come to an end (and also finals iirc), I think it's important to remember to keep to COVID-19 safe distancing guidelines.

The girl in this true story will be known as cookie because she loves chip cookies/cookie chips.

Let's start! I got to know cookie around term 1 this year even though we had been in the same class for a year. Due to the pandemic,everyone had to abide safe distancing measure and sit far apart. Because of this the whole seating plan changed and cookie happened to sit  behind me. I was too lucky to have 360° surrounded by girls!(LOL)Because we sat close to each other,I got to know her better. Then CB came, I chatted with her once a while .To be honest,we actually drifted abit.

After CB ended,we still sat close to one another and I got to know her to better. We confided a lot of stuff that we were not supposed to do at this age. It kind of surprised me but I liked her attitude which was very unique (maybe it was not common in my sch or something).As I got to know her better, I actually realised I like her alot. I still remember the day I confessed to her. It was national day celebrations.

I confessed to her that I likedked her and she msged me that she liked me back. But we told ourselves that we were not dating yet. I started messaging her quite frequently. I would be even messaging her when I commute to school and back to home. We even started holding hands during class. I don't know   whether at this point I was dating her because we were holding hands.It was kind of fun and scary but we got the guts to do it.Because we were still afraid that we could be caught by principal during the walkaround as our seats were close to window.Before prelims started we agreed to go for a movie at the last day of our prelims.
As planned we went for a movie and we could PDA more freely....
Our boat sailed smoothly till about graduation day. She gave me a small goody bag or something. I didn't give her and I assumed that she was kind of abit disappointed.But nvm. We took a photo and went for study break.She posted on ig and the captions were  horrendous. I asked her about it and it really made me mad that you could see smoke out of my ears.After a few days into study break we msged me that she liked ANOTHER BOY. It made me f..king mad that I blocked her on WhatsApp and Instagram and I even threw away the goody bag she gave mei to the bin. I vented my anger on the punching bag and forgot about her totally. I started studying for o levels andI totally forgot about her till  I saw her for pract and o levels.
What's really disturbing me is that I can tell that she is still looking at my eyes whenever I am looking elsewhere which makes me desperate to talk to her. I really don't know why. Yesterday I unblocked her and found myself looking at the picture we took at the grad day for long time.

For cases like the Bishan case, I feel like that would be excused. I feel like majority of Singaporeans are not taking the Circuit Breaker seriously. I know all of us want to go out. But if we keep having community cases. Everybody in Singapore would be heavily affected in day to day life.

Its also based on the opinion that I think alot of Singaporean's follow these measures for show but do not actually treat or adhere to these measures seriously. Therefore, we still have community cases. Im also basing this off the idea that a person following the social distancing measures and the measures put in place during Circuit breaker, should have less than 1% chance of contracting the virus. And if people feel like these measures are not enough. They would take extra precautions. Because right now, alot of Singaporeans are visiting each other and going out when they don't need to. So instead of having the trouble to identify and catch each person that breaks these measures. Heavy penalties would be put in place of those who catch covid 19 during circuit breakers so that the initiative would be on each person to act on these measures.

So on a human level, we cannot blame them or fault them in an event they do spread the virus while on their essential activities. It is widely accepted there will never be ""0"" community cases but a low number till a vaccine is more than ideal.', 'I dont think the problem is ""asymptomatic"" carriers. I believe that the virus is still believed to be spread through droplets and not airborne. So the safe distancing measures should still be working if followed, so are the wearing of masks. So whether or not the infected person has symptoms or not, the method of transmission is still the same. Which is why the safe distancing measures is what it is.\n\nIf people think that breaching safe distancing measures because the person doesnt have any symptoms, then thats a problem. \n\nSymptomatic or Asymptomatic carriers still transmit the virus by droplets so I don\'t think the problem is specifically Asymptomatic carriers. \n\nThe problem I\'m proposing is that there are groups of people breaching these measures and that\'s why the virus is still being transmitted locally.\n\nAs to why these people are breaching these measures? An explanation I think of is complacency.', 'If you read MOH reports daily, you can see that links are being established to essential workers that are working in infected dormitories. This could be healthcare, construction workers that deal with FWs directly.\n\nSo.. based on statistics and facts provided by MOH as of now, the virus is not transmitted around by people who are irresponsible. In fact, the people that do not abide by CB measures strictly is only affecting the ""integrity"" of the measures.\n\nThis is my opinion but I do understand and see where you are coming from.', 'Yep but only recently there are still people who do not have any links to these Foreign Workers who have the virus.

It can feel like an echo chamber when we think everyone outside/online are breaking the law, even though there are many exceptions. \n\nDoubting so many makes us skeptical, it makes us paranoid. It makes us trust others less. It's not healthy for us to think like this, it builds stress and anger. We don't see the millions staying home. It won't help us to think like this.\n\nI agree we are seeing more people outside, but there has been easing and humans arent made to stay in our caves 24/7. Imagine you live alone, as an extrovert, without a job, you might go get food rather than order in for your own mental health. Or walk out with your sister and get glares. \n\nPreventative measures greatly reduce transmission chances, but do not make them 0. Therefore you can't fine people...

It is true that there is a significant increase in the amount of people taking public transport compared from last month.\n\nI understand that you seem wary that I might only buy into my own beliefs or those that align with me. However, even outside of my social bubble. There have been many people that are breaching circuit breaker measures. I don’t think anyone would be able to dispute that there isnt an increase in people taking public transport and / or a rise in people going to other people’s houses. Im sure some of you may have also seen teenagers or young adults delivering birthday cakes or bubble tea to their friends. This was not as common back in April.\n\nWhich is why I made the statement that circuit breaker isnt taken seriously by some or if not many Singaporeans. I made this statement because of what I have seen, and also I have caught myself thinking that I should keep going out to take walks. However I have only limited myself to get out my house for runs.\n\nAnd preventative measures you say reduce transmission chances but not make them 0. I disagree with you, I think preventative measures first and foremost are to reduce chances of infections then slowly make its way down to 0.\n\nIf everybody were to take their own initiative to prevent themselves from getting infected by being extra cautious when being outside, such as not touching your face etc. Its highly possible for transmissions to be zero. SARS burning out was a miracle but we cant hope for that again. This measure that im entertaining on giving penalties to people being infected is not to punish those infected but more of a deterrent to those who are entertaining ideas of making trips that are not essential to places around Singapore.\n\nClearly when you go outside you will at least see one breach of safety pertaining to the measures put in place. \n\nMaybe my statement of ‘Most Singaporeans arent taking circuit breaker seriously’ is harsh and opinionated.\n\nBut I think the phrase ‘There is an increasing number of Singaporeans that stopped taking circuit breaker measures seriously’ might be more of a fact than an opinion.', ""Lol, no way.\n\n1) How are we going to determine if someone went out for an essential purpose? If a supermarket employee got the virus, are we going to penalise this patient? Even if the person isn't an essential worker, what if he has elderly parents living alone and claims he's helping with groceries? Where do we draw the line wrt who to punish?\n2) What if people don't want to see a doctor when they get symptoms because of the penalty? We already have a problem whereby people go about their daily lives despite showing symptoms (see SAFRA Jurong cluster). 80% of cases are mild, so who out of that 80% would see a doctor when sick to potentially get penalised? No one in the right mind would do accept penalties for doing the socially responsible thing. Penalising patients will render containment a failure and backfire spectacularly.\n3) More people on trains could also be due to more businesses opening, such as TCM shops and confectionery outlets. Employees must get to work somehow. Graduating students are also going back to school for supplementary lessons.\n\nYes there are complacent people going around no doubt, but just because there's people whom we anecdotally see being complacent and breaking the rules doesn't mean that going the other extreme is the way to go or even feasible. I do agree financial penalties (seriously even Malaysia fines RM1000 or ~S$333 Vs our S$300) can be harsher to create a greater deterrence. Penalising the infected is a big no-no""]"

TLDR. I am suggesting that we should go for herd immunity, with the circuit breaker being lifted today. What we should do going forward is to keep the more relaxed restrictions we have in March. That is, continue social distancing and washing our hand, but allow gathering to continue up to a limit of 10 (or maybe 50). Keep restaurants, schools, salons etc open. Enhance isolation of those people who are in nursing home (the most vulnerable population).

What I am saying here expresses only my opinion, and no one else. I am writing here to generate a discussion and gather more opinions. I am suggesting that we are likely to had went through our current enhanced lockdown for nothing. Continuing with all the restrictions we had in March was enough.

Globally, we have been misled to believe that the fatality rate is between 1% to 3%. But recent surveys suggested that the number is much closer to 0.2% to 0.6%. 0.5% is from a survey in New York, where the healthcare system was overwhelmed. This article from New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-antibodies-test-ny.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-antibodies-test-ny.html)) suggested that. To quote the article “If the pattern holds, the results from random testing of 3,000 people raised the tantalizing prospect that many New Yorkers — as many as 2.7 million, the governor \[Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\] said — who never knew they had been infected had already encountered the virus, and survived.” As a result, “the death rate in New York from Covid-19 would most likely be far lower than previously believed, possibly 0.5 percent of those infected.”. This article was from 23 April 2020.

Antibody test suggested that New York City already have 20% of people being infected. Stockholm another 20%, Heinsberg (Germany’s covid-19 epicentre) already have 14 percent. These are study done about a week ago, and people who are tested positive in these antibodies tests would have been infected weeks ago. Developing the required antibodies takes time. So, these are the total number of people who have been infected maybe two weeks back, so the number today would be higher. These results are suggesting a much higher infection rate for Covid-19 then we have been made to believe, perhaps being even more infectious than Influenze (H1N1, which is also known as Swine Flu, started in 2009 and infected about 1 billion people by 2010). Given that these areas already have so many people being infected, it is impossible to keep the number of cases down to zero. Right now, the number of cases for them is going down. But when they open up, the number of cases will only go up. They are much closer to herd immunity as compared to bringing the number down to zero. In fact, Sweden’s capital, Stockholm, is expected to achieve herd immunity (\~60% of people infected) by end of May. Chances are that US and EU have no choice but to go into herd immunity. What would Singapore do then?

The virus is going to hit us, whether or not we want it. Unless Singapore is ready to seal its border for the next 18 months. Optimistically, within 18 months, an effective drug/vaccine would have been found and ready for mass production. Historically, no vaccine had been ready for mass usage within a year. Unless we are ready to seal our border, majority of us will be infected before the vaccine arrive. Given that we will get the virus eventually, having a lockdown today is not going to help us, we are simply pushing the pain to the future.

I am suggesting for Singapore to aim for herd immunity through natural infection instead of suppressing the virus. How herd immunity work is that by having around 60 % of the population already infected by Covid-19 then recover, the virus would not be spreading through our country as fast even when we leave the restriction. It would not spread as fast because the number R0 (number of people each infected person infects) would be lower because out of 10 person that we could originally past to, 6 of them are already immune and only 4 of them could be infected. We do so by keeping all the restrictions we had in March, but add it on with compulsory mask in public transport and crowded places so that the number of cases would not increase too fast for our healthcare system. Let the virus spread through the population in a controlled manner such that the number of people infected stays at a sustainable level so that the healthcare would not be overwhelmed. A preliminary ball park figure would be 10,000 new infections everyday, but I need to do my study on this, if anyone have a research paper suggesting the right number, do let me know!

Of course, going back to the more relax measure that we had in March would increase the number of people who requires medical attention, potentially overwhelming Singapore’s medical system. But what we read about Singapore healthcare system being severely overwhelmed are being made by a wrong assumption – they severely overestimated the number of people who needs medical attention and ICU facility. I am suggesting that whoever is advising our government on their approach, have used a very wrong number that far exaggerated the real seriousness of the virus. Today (1st May 2020) we have about 15,000 migrant worker who are already infected, yet three is in ICU. On 17 April 2020, Straits time reported that by the time 20 thousand of our migrant workers get infected, we will need 200 ICU beds to treat them. Quoting from Straits Time “Prof Fisher \[senior infectious diseases expert at the National University Hospital\] said: ""If 20,000 get infected, they will need at least 200 ICU beds, and statistically there may be 40 deaths.” ([https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/surge-in-virus-infections-strains-healthcare-system](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/surge-in-virus-infections-strains-healthcare-system)). The 20,000 infections here refer to the migrant population. I don’t think it is a stretch to assume that Singapore’s government had been using this kind of prediction when suggesting that our healthcare system would be overwhelmed without the additional lockdown measures we had in April. I am comparing the measures between what we are doing now, versus what it was back in March. As a result, we might all be going to lockdown because the severity of this virus is being overestimated, by an order of 100x. Professor Fisher estimation suggest that at least 150 migrant workers would be in ICU because we have about 15,000 infections, but in reality, we are seeing single digit number of migrant worker in ICU right now. 150 vs single digit, that's a very big overestimation. Not to mention, given that we now know that in places like New York, California, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden, the number of people who have been infected is 10 times the number that is being confirmed by covid-19 test. Maybe the number of migrant populations being infected is not 15k. Maybe, it is half of 300k. Three ICU patients among 150 thousand infected migrant population. Let that sink.

We could also look at the number of ICU beds that Sweden needed through thisCovid-19 pandemic. If I understand this website ([https://www.icuregswe.org/en/data--results/covid-19-in-swedish-intensive-care/](https://www.icuregswe.org/en/data--results/covid-19-in-swedish-intensive-care/)) correctly, Sweden needed at most 558 ICU for covid-19 at any point of time, yet they are suspected to have infected about 1 million people by the beginning of May. Sweden has a population of 10 million, and Singapore has about 5.6 million people. Also, Singapore is capable of having 600 ICU beds for Covid-19 ( [https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/coronavirus-22-patients-in-icu-hospitals-have-nearly-150-vacant-icu-beds-and-can-add](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/coronavirus-22-patients-in-icu-hospitals-have-nearly-150-vacant-icu-beds-and-can-add) ), which is higher than the 558 needed in Sweden for covid-19.

Another important thing to consider is how many could we save by pushing the virus back until a vaccine is found. Base on figures from Europe, most of the death are among those above 70 years old. In fact, in some countries, the median age of death is actually higher than the life expectancy. What's the proportion of those who died from covid-19 that would had died from other causes if they didn't get covid-19 within 1.5 years (the time it takes for a vaccine to be in mass usage in an optimistic scenario)? In some countries, about half the death from covid-19 are from nursing home, and in these nursing home, e.g. in Sweden, majority of them don't really have much longer than a year to live. In other words, about half the death from covid-19 are among people who would had died by 2022 without covid-19. What it means is that the extra health issue (mental and physical health impact of prolonged lock down) could actually outweigh the negative impact of achieving herd immunity through natural infection against covid-19. There is no actual number for this figure yet, and we could only really know it around 2023 by comparing with the excess mortality.

Another thing to mention is that even if a vaccine is found, it may not be 100% effective. Some of us could, especially the elderly, could still be vulnerable to covid-19 even if there is vaccine. Even the flu vaccine, after decades of research and development, only reduces the odds of getting the flu by 60%. Note that this flu vaccine has already taken into account that there are multiple strains of Influenza. Also, there is still no HIV vaccine, no effective dengue vaccine (there's one for those who had been infected at least once by dengue, but none for those who have yet to be exposed). There are some vaccine that even results in vaccine enhanced diseases, but we can't be sure that a vaccine won't result in that until we get to test the vaccine extensively. Vaccine takes about a decade to develop for good reason, to make sure that the vaccine is safe for everyone, especially the elderly and those with co-morbidity. But accelerating the vaccine development so quickly could also means we are removing some of these safety measure.

One major objection to the herd immunity approach is that immunity is not guaranteed. To such objection, I paraphrase Professor Johan Giesecke, the former State Epidemiologist for Sweden and current advisor to Sweden’s herd immunity strategy “Because it is a coronavirus, and we know about six other coronavirus and why would this be special”. Basically, we develop immunity for all other coronaviruses so far, so we will be developing an immunity for Covid-19. The only question is how long our immunity will last. Everyday of lockdown causes us hardship and even more death. Treatment for less serious illnesses will be pushed back as long as the virus is still within us. When these people do eventually get treated, their condition will get more serious because of delayed treatment. The longer we take to adopt the herd immunity strategy, the longer we had to push back treatments for less severe illnesses (heart issues, kidney issues, etc). Not to mention the devastating economic impacts it has on us. The general health of a population usually suffers during a financial crisis. Not only that, a reduction in tax revenue and increased in fiscal spending could also mean less resources for healthcare in the future, which could have a negative impact on future healthcare standard.

Lockdown is not harmless. Lockdown is playing dice with the devastating health and sociological impact that lockdown creates on us. Lockdown is not the prudent strategy of waiting until we know more about the virus then we go ahead. Maybe it was. But today, we already have enough data to suggest that we can go for herd immunity.

Singapore should lift the lockdown measure, while making sure to calibrate their strategy so that their ICU facility has at least a few % (maybe 1% to 2%, I don’t know the number, do let me know if you have any research on this number) of spare capacity at each point of time. We too should protect the most vulnerable from the infection, basically the nursing homes. Those in nursing home who are unable to care for themselves are far more at risk than the elderlies who can take public transport on their own. Singaporeans are not stupid. Singaporeans know what is good for themselves and for others. The government can trust us on that.

Super spreader events doesn't just leave a lot of people infected, it also tend to leave people sicker due to the suspected initial higher viral load that people get in such event. Also current estimations is that about 45% of the transmission is from people with symptoms, about 10% are from environment, and the last 45% are from pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. With 45 % of the transmission being from people with symptoms, it may actually be sufficient to reduce the transmission by half just by asking those with even the mildest symptoms to isolate themselves at home. Of course in practice there could be many who flout the rules, perhaps incentive (e.g government subsidized paid sick leave sponsored) and punishment has to be in place."", ""I would think that one year is sufficient. I suspect that Singapore's healthcare system is able to handle about 10,000 to 20,000 new infection a day, but there is no such reliable estimations out there so it is hard to tell.

Of course, we have to take into account if there is sufficient non-icu capacity, and I don't have such data.   \n\n\nRegarding mutation, even if it mutates, good chance that there will be cross-immunity between the different strains of covid-19.

Alttyrt,1608026458,kdj0g3,24,1,"With the news of Singapore and other countries getting vaccines in the coming weeks, when do you guys expect the likely possibility of us returning to normal (i.e. pre-COVID days)?

I know I commented previously in the vaccines thread about the [authorities continuing to enforce safe distancing and mask-wearing even after the vaccines roll out](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/kd986l/sporeans_still_need_to_wear_masks_practise/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). I asked when can we expect to return back to the old normal when enough evidence emerges of the vaccine's true effectiveness for Singapore.

Now, I decide to ask this as the main question on this subreddit: **when can we expect a return to normal for Singapore, a day where we can finally remove our masks outside with no penalty?** Don't assume me to be an anti-masker or anything like that. But I just have a persistent hope or belief that the vaccines may certainly be the cure for the virus that ruined our year and lives. That there is light at the end of the tunnel after all. That this vaccine can return us back to normal.

However, there are many commentaries, warnings aren't out there saying that the vaccines isn't the magical wonder-drug to stop the pandemic, the silver bullet. Even though they do have a point, I fear that they are squashing any hope I have. I'm very concerned about the possibility of whether we have to face this pandemic for a very long time that mask-wearing is a permanent thing. And like all of us having the travel bug, I am yearning for the days where I can freely plan my vacation and go to the places I want to go. I want to be able to freely watch cinema without the possibility of the film getting pushed back. Being a spectacle-wearer due to very high astigmatism, the masks I wear everytime I go out just fogs up my glasses and makes my voice muffled.

I very much missed the pre-COVID days that I take for granted.

Looking at history itself, all pandemics do not last forever. They either stop entirely or it slows down to be less contagious.

But looking at COVID and the recent developments, when can we estimate a return back to normal or at the very least, stop wearing masks if given a chance? I'm just hoping luck will be on our side next year.

Again, don't judge me for being an anti-masker, being too impatient or anything like that. I'm not enforcing any agenda but I'm hoping for some consensus on this subreddit. Just a realistic opinion to look out for in the coming year.",askSingapore,32560,"With the recent news of vaccines coming out in not just Singapore but also other parts of the world, when can we expect a return to normal (i.e. pre-COVID days)?

I work in a neighbourhood retail shop where customers come in, buy their stuff and exit, i.e. No doors, open floor plan. Queues are the norm and with safe distancing measures in place, queues can get long.

There is this intellectually challenged 30 year old boy who frequently barges into the shop, with no mask on and stands very, very closely to other customers and our staff. He cannot speak and does not respond to spoken words. He brings in lighted incense bunch, cigarette in mouth, beer mugs etc and is a general nuisance to the safety of the shop's operations. He sits at the exit point of the shop and obstructs people. Rummage through the trash can and creates messes. 

Recently, he 'pounced' on a Filipino customer and was witnessed touching her breasts and head. Police reports made and they said they found him and will refer to MSF.

My question is: what can I do about this situation? 

He is still going to barge into my shop as and when he likes, and now can be a physical danger to my customers and staff. I cannot possibly hold him off physically.

melatoningoatmilk,1620107595,n4h6cy,13,1,"Are the elderly in Singapore being neglected by our society? It was the first time that I genuinely thought about this question: read on to understand why.

My father has been let off of his full-time job at a higher education institution since he is of retirement age, and he has since started to work in part-time stints (eg. safe distancing ambassador) with long hours. He told me that he is going to work in a fast food chain and I am really worried for his health and whether he will be treated badly by his employer/ customers. It pains me to imagine him having to serve others, and the picture of him wearing the fast food uniform just kills my head. He reasoned that he wanted to learn something new and that working at a fast food chain could help to pass time.

He is not earning much from the job; he is only paid $7/hour which is so low. But he insists that working there is better than staying at home and doing nothing. Personally, I dont approve of him working long hours and manual labour at his age of 65+, but I feel conflicted. He should be able to experience new things even at his age, but I feel the need to ensure that he is safe. I am still in university, so I am unable to support him financially (as much as I wish to). He is really stubborn on not leading an idle lifestyle and feels the need to make use of his free time for some cash. I mean, there are many hobbies out there that he could use to enjoy his life after retirement, right?

Do any of your parents/ grandparents have such similar experiences? And how do you cope with those thoughts?

Anyway a sentence he said really shook me: ""At my age no one would hire me for normal jobs anymore"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I am posting this here?**

To inform people who have been following the story about the end-result of the August-September fight to reduce the crowd on campus. Also to share with uninitiated readers of the overly bureaucratic process of trying to get the administration to understand what is happening on the ground. 

**Why did I approach the administration?**

I was worried about the health of my family members, some of whom are very frail with dementia or chemotherapy related side effects. Friends were also worried about the health of their family members. Some even had their parents ask them if they really needed to go to school, reflecting parental concern about the crowing situation on campus. 

 **What will this thread cover?**

This thread will present mostly the timeline of the process and facts relating to it. I will try my best to omit any personal opinions to allow readers to come to their own conclusion. I sincerely apologize to anyone who gets offended when they come across any unsavory stuff regarding NTU. However, I believe that we can love our University and at the same time be objective enough to discuss its shortcomings. 

There are restrictions to what I can or cannot share. For example official emails with NTU staff, or meeting transcripts can't be shared, but I will make a short summary out of it. 

# Background story

Since the start of the semester, the campus has been filled with crowds as students try to occupy study areas for their online lessons on campus. It sounds stupid to attend online lessons on campus because it defeats the purpose, but we don't have much of a choice if students have a mix of both online and physical lessons in a day with little breaks between them. Having to attend online lessons in public areas with high foot traffic further lowered the quality of education for us. The campus looked as if it was pre-pandemic times with common areas, food establishments and bus stops flooded with students. 

From [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gjgtzd/uni_ntu_school_of_biological_sciences_ama/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), we can appreciate that no other tertiary educational institute in Singapore faced such crowds on their campus. \[Opinion\] Only here in NTU, where the measures were [lackluster and ineffective](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/innb7t/table_of_ntu_precautionary_measures_and_their/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) we were forced to waddle in a health hazard.

It is my personal opinion that the administration does not see itself to be accountable to the student body, given that they could not even keep the simple promise of sending out an email. 

We students should not solely rely on the Student Union representatives to push the administration for answers or accountability as their power is limited to their willingness to ask difficult questions. We students have a responsibility to push both the University administration for accountability and also to push our Student Union to represent our voice.

In other words, many students don\'t care. I know I worried much more about my assessments and missing lessons than COVID for this semester. That is why you received SU\'s reply that they think you are pushing your own agenda.\n\n&gt;As a response to the crowds at bus stops, CHSEO said ""As a student if you see a crowd forming, do you still want to join? Everybody has a role to play, you all are adults, I am also adult, what you want me to do?""\n\n* What he said is true, but the problem exists because it is a systemic issue, simply because the system isn\'t put in place to de-incentivize crowds, whether at bus stops or at lectures.\n\n* It stands to reason that the school actually has the same sentiment about COVID as the students, which is there there\'s ""nothing to make a fuss of""\n\n* I have to disagree that the school does not see itself as accountable. There were many updates throughout the past few months on COVID\'s situation. I think it\'s more they don\'t see a need to be accountable because the situation has (at least in their eyes) stabilized', ""&gt;especially as community cases have dwindled down to near-zero for many days.\n\nYes, the number of community cases have indeed stabilized in the past month. However, you have to remember that when our semester first started in August, things weren't as rosy as it is today.\n\n[https://co.vid19.sg/singapore/](https://co.vid19.sg/singapore/)\n\n&gt;What he said is true,\n\nNo doubt what he said is true, but it shows the disconnect between the decision makers and the ground. If students need to get to classes or go home on time, what choice do we really have when it comes to crowds at bus stops? The problem arose because of the measures implemented by them.\n\n&gt;I have to disagree that the school does not see itself as accountable. There were many updates throughout the past few months on COVID's situation. I think it's more they don't see a need to be accountable because the situation has (at least in their eyes) stabilized\n\nComparing the COVID measures of NTU and other tertiary institutes, we can see how lax and ineffective ours were that resulted in huge crowds on campus. The accountability portion trickles in when the top brass decided to kick me around like a soccer ball from department to department for a month before deciding to take things seriously."", ""&gt; Yes, the number of community cases have indeed stabilized in the past month. However, you have to remember that when our semester first started in August, things weren't as rosy as it is today. \n\nExactly, and that's why I made reference to the current situation. It is indeed baffling how there has been no actions taken given what was the situation a mere few months ago."", ""Great that you reached out to them!\n\nI agree with your points and I believe that NTU (or at least my school SCSE) will be transitioning fully to physical classes next sem. Which honestly, doesn't seem like a great idea.\n\nI do agree that students, including me, do not care about the pandemic so much as it seems to have stabilised. (Also from a place of privilege as I do not live with anyone who is at risk to the virus such as elderly) \n\nThus, the NTU admin may not see it as something that students want / need. However, just because most students don't care doesn't mean the admin shouldn't care. Every life matters. What if a student bring it home to their immunocompromised family member? What if one of the students is pregnant? Honestly, its a question of morals, and it seems like the admin cares for the majority who will be fine even if it breaks out in NTU. As long as there is this fundamental moral difference, I doubt that they would understand.\n\nThe response is disappointing and I would also like to note that SafeEntry is very ineffective. You have the same Safe Entry 'clusters' for both buildings N3 and N4 (as they are connected), which is not effective for contact tracing. And they have not made Trace Together which measures proximity to others mandatory either. I think TraceTogether should be made mandatory in NTU esp as you have so many places where crowds can bottleneck. I also understand that they can't have SafeEntry for every room but having safe entry that requires use of your email, and has details to fill in takes longer than just scanning makes more less likely to use it. (And other times i get errors when trying to use the form).\n\nAn additional point to note is that the odd / even week system also makes no sense. Yes, by splitting up the students, you reduce the spread but the Prof / TA is the same for both session. You just need one person to spread the disease. Thus, its not at all effective. Instead of having one group watch online, just have everyone watch online.\n\nAlso, their idea of having more CAs and quizzes instead of just finals also puts a huge amount of stress on students which is also why I believe, more are worried about school, rather than pandemic. Adding that to the stress of being more socially isolated, I think most students are just too stressed out.\n\nI agree that there is responsibility to be held by both students and the admin. However, a larger portion of that is placed on the admins as they can make students act and make the school much safer. Good on you for raising awareness and trying to make the situation better."", '&gt;I agree with your points and I believe that NTU (or at least my school SCSE) will be transitioning fully to physical classes next sem.\n\nAre your lectures all online? I thought next sem will be similar to this sem. (Lectures online, tutorials/labs offline).', 'not 100% sure, intu wont load for me,,,,,', 'Check STARS', 'For lectures that did not state online, do i have to attend in-person?', 'yup should be attend in person if not stated', 'Oh ok thanks', 'it finally loaded, and lects are online, but prev sem even tutorials were online but now theyre offline.', ""thanks for helping us with this mess.. \n\nthis is honestly the norm rather than the exception. even for matters that are not related to the virus, the school admin predominantly replies using cookie cutter emails that does not even remotely address the concerns we usually raise (I've received 3 emails with the exact same paragraph, from the exact same person after telling them that what they mentioned is completely irrelevant)..\n\nHonestly, they can only keep up such an attitude because they won't lose customers that easily... if it was easy to transfer credits without delaying graduation or without much pain in the process, you can rest assured that their replies will be more targetted"", ""Thank you so much for reaching out for us! I completely agree with you. I don't stay in hall, so going to school for tutorials is worrying for my family and I. This is especially so when I have a close relationship with my grandmother. I know this may not be the case for everyone and the number of community cases has dwindled down, but let's not to be too complacent and start taking the situation lightly. There are definitely still asymptomatic cases in the community and a second wave is always bound to happen if we loosen restrictions too fast. Besides, if other universities and polytechnics can conduct lessons and exams completely online for just 1 semester, I don't see why ntu has to be any different. Resuming normalcy is one thing, but being safe than sorry is another."", 'Thanks for raising the issue up! The schoom certainly needs to do much better in communicating with students and proactively seeking students feedback and how the actual policies play out.\n\nI can see your frustration with NTUSU in the communications and it does seem that both of you are trying your best but perhaps because everything is on email its hard to understand each other. I thought it was good that they took the time to respond to you during exams and that you toom time out to raise these concerns during a busy period too! Stay safe and god bless!', 'Thank you so much for sparing time, energy, and emotional labour to press on the school\'s administration on their inadequacies with regards to this pandemic. NTU has been a step behind amongst other local universities, even the only local university to have their hall allocation delayed by 4 weeks (5 weeks for me) into the semester, which was a big problem for me who struggle with mental illness and fatigue from 2 hour 30min long one way commutes.\n\nIt is frustrating that they are operating as if things are ""normal"" even though many are not insulated from the side effects of pandemic (housing insecurity, loss of income, poorer mental health). I really messed up this semester so badly that I submitted 60-75% of assignments for every module this semester and my GPA is really going to plummet.\n\n**I don\'t know how detached the administration are that they are more concerned about academic rigour over our wellbeing to increase our assignments &amp; assessments in a pandemic.**\n\nWe really cannot rely on the SU. They are really in a bind to behave timidly and not threaten the administrative hierarchy. Also, only a small handful are concern about pertinent structural issues in school while the vast majority are careerists, using this position to make their CV look nice.\n\nWe can only rely on ourselves to probe the administration to get their shit together independently as individuals and obviously they are not used to this. Please keep up your efforts and have faith that others like me are also pushing boundaries in our capacity.', 'Now school got covid case and my prof want physical attendance for both lectures and tutorials. Would prefer if they make lectures online and keep tutorials in-person or make everything online.', 'Yes, greatly disappointed that all my lectures are physical. 4 day study week and no hall, pain to travel and worse still the campus riders are packed like no one cares. Someone has got to send pictures to straits times and the minister.', ""You *chose* to come to ntu for SUSEP lol, why didn't you bother checking with anyone about the way we're conducting our classes *before* applying? Don't bitch and whine about things you cannot change. You're not the only one without a hall, you're not the only one who has to travel, campus riders are always packed because there are not enough buses during peak hours. \n\nYou think we haven't complained? You *really* think we haven't brought it up to the student union/administration? As if blowing this up to ST and/or ministers would change things. You think they care? \n\nEndure it this sem, or withdraw from SUSEP, since coming to ntu is such a horrible experience for you. Then you can go back to nus and live your pampered, comfortable life."", 'Just supporting TS\'s post. You don\'t have to over-react. If my intention was to complain, I have much more to ""whine"" about.\n\nBtw, NTU is my only option available for SEP, overseas SEP has been cancelled twice for me. Not like I have a choice.\n\nYou have to relax and stay calm. I have nothing against NTU. If it were the same for NUS, I would say the same too. My suggestion to get straits times to advertise is only for your own good. Cheers.']"
