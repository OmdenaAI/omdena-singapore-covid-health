0,fr7euj,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378515,silverraptures,False,public,,what is rational and what is paranoia in these times?,"I‚Äôve been feeling outraged at people who treat healthcare worker in a discriminatory way. I felt angry at British landlords evicting NHS workers, or people refusing to sell food to ambulance drivers, etc. Today I felt this sense of righteousness dissipated when faced with threat (real or perceived) of getting COVID.  

This morning, I took a cab where the cab driver told me he had to pick up a minimum no. of clients per day to cover rent. so I felt sorry for him and asked him about how business was - he shared about how he needs the income as he has a son who‚Äôs graduated for a year but still unable to find employment, and he‚Äôs trying to make money etc. 

At the same time, I noticed he spoke with a very hoarse throat and was coughing. He wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask - but that didn‚Äôt bother me right away because long driving shifts are uncomfortable. 

A few minutes later, he told me his daughter works in NUH, and that her ward handles 34 COVID patients. rationally, I understood that everyone has their livelihoods to attend to or keep. However, behind this polite conversation, I was panicking and worried about potentially picking the virus up (and passing it on to others, especially my parents). Was intending to wear my mask when I boarded the cab, and felt it was too impolite to put it on after he mentioned his daughter works in NUH, and that she lives with him. 

Nonetheless, I waited for the journey to come to an end and alighted. I rationalised to myself: healthcare workers tend to be the *safest* - because they take extra precautions to be sanitised etc so they will not pose more risks to their patients. And with that, I tried to take my mind off it. Not trying to be a hypochondriac, but right now, my throat and nose feels very warm and heaty - and I hope all the cooling remedies will save me. 

I feel like every decision is somewhat morally ambiguous - should I have taken public transport? should the cab driver have worn a mask? And in this time of uncertainty, I think we tend to see everything through the lens of self-interest, anxiety and suspicion. Every intention can be reduced to ‚Äúirrational‚Äù and ‚Äúselfish‚Äù. While I was not part of the extreme toilet paper hoarding or unethical upselling of masks crowd - I, too, could not nitpick most actions of many. But anyway don‚Äôt worry, gonna self-isolate for the next few weeks to be safe...(and only take public transport after that)

EDIT: thank you redditors for your advice and tips; tldr post was about how there is no true objectivity or moral authority *per se* and as flawed as our actions may be on hindsight. we may react slower purely because of habits or patterns of socialisation etc.? i think as long as something is not done out of wilful negligence or against clear advice, please be charitable to the human beings making their trade-offs or decisions everyday",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fr7euj/what_is_rational_and_what_is_paranoia_in_these/,41,107,0,107,0.93,Sun Mar 29 23:17:02 2020,Discussion

4,eugb8t,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378515,xinjiaporen,False,public,,Have you noticed the paranoia from some Singaporeans with regards to the Wuhan outbreak? What can I do about it?,"Obviously I have. This behaviour stems from that one or two uncles/aunties that tend to spread rubbish on family WhatsApp groups.

Some of the crazy things suggested by said aunty/uncle:

* Scold mainlanders or call police/ambulance if they cough without covering up their mouths. Someone added on saying they would spray their face with disinfectant.
* Don't buy food from stalls that are worked on by mainlanders, since they may have Wuhan virus. Don't use food delivery services, because you need to ensure that the chefs are not mainlanders.
* Refuse face-to-face interaction with mainlanders at work and ask boss for alternative arrangements (e.g. work from home).

and so on and so forth. You get the gist, it's always ""Don't do X with mainlanders"" or ""Do X to mainlanders to prevent spread of Wuhan"". It's like as though they are the manifestation of the virus itself.

They also suggested that government should deport all mainlanders till it dies down and stop the flow of mainlanders to Singapore.

I feel this is a little hypocritical, borderline xenophobic and best of all, too kiasi that you end up having a mundane, boring, crippling life. Not to mention, our older generations also don't practice good hygeine (like ""hack, p-tui"" into drains and sinks, which is gross).

I am also angry at those who started this outbreak, namely those buying/selling live animals at the market and the government officials for covering up, but I don't see how labeling everyone from China as ""snake/dog eaters"" is doing us any good and avoiding all of them to get that increase in survival chance is borderline paranoid.

I can't really block a family group chat, but what can I do to stop this insanity and ensure that this fear doesn't spread till it becomes a larger problem than Wuhan virus itself?",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/eugb8t/have_you_noticed_the_paranoia_from_some/,26,0,0,0,0.43,Mon Jan 27 09:04:07 2020,

8,gk3pzm,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77618,Proper_1869,False,public,,[Uni] Rejected by all universities. And this is how I felt. what about you?,"I will never forget this stage of my life. A period of constant paranoia that was fueled by the immense helplessness. For a prolonged period, I would click on my Gmail icon every morning, hoping to receive a response to my university applications. To no avail, my inbox was always empty though there were times when junk mails or Zalora would get my hopes up until I saw the sender. At this stage, there were moments when I felt angry at the admissions for giving me such a torturous suspension. The waiting period was unbearable, it was like an unreachable itch at the back of my mind and it would creep up on me whenever I was isolated or not doing anything. At that time, I just wanted everything to have a result, I just wish they would end my misery by cutting me loss. Thoughts like ‚Äújust reject me already please‚Äù ran through my mind all the time,  I felt like a war warrior who just wanted to quickly get shot at the battlefield to ease the suspension.

Little did I know that suspension was way better than the reality, there was hope, at least. On the 14th of May 2020, 10 days before the first acceptance window deadline, I learnt that many of my friends had gotten their offers at the top three universities. And that skyrocketed my hope because I thought I might have a chance since I scored similar rank points as them. That night, I turned on my laptop and went on to the official student portal excitedly, hoping that I could share a similar fate as my friends. However, the results were not in my favour. I was bluntly rejected by NUS, SIT and SUTD, all the universities that I had applied to basically. That was when I started to appreciate the torturous suspension I had a few seconds ago and I realised my preparation for this undesirable outcome was merely a paper-thin bulletproof vest that could not defend the nuclear-like reality. The reality was much harsher than I expected. Looking at the glowing ‚ÄúRejected‚Äù my mind went blank, my vision blurred, darkened and I spaced out.

Shock, sadness, disappointment, helplessness and shame, all of them colluded, turned into an iron fist and punched me hard right at my windpipe. To be honest, never have I ever imagined that was how breathtaking feels like. Not only was I unable to inhale at the point, but I was also overwhelmed by the immense sensation of pain. It was not a quick stab kind of a pain but rather a slow burn. It felt like a skilled butcher with a blunt blade, aimed at my chest, penetrated through my skin, my flesh, my bones and added a twist when it reached my heart.

A friend of mine asked if I was ok, I replied yes. ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, just seemed to be the best candidate to describe this emotional turmoil. God knows how long had I spent looking at my ceiling before falling asleep but what else could I have done? Crying? Screaming? Leaping off a bridge? Nah. It was a moment of chaotic nothingness, I did not know what to do or where to go. My mind was just blank, blank, blank.

10,hctlbu,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77618,pinky_throwaway_2003,False,public,,"[Rant] [O levels] Same ol vicious cycle, long post","Background: I took a year off to get my head straight after going through more than 3 years of living hell in sec school.

I never liked my secondary school. From the first day, the buildings just seemed to give off evil aura. My head just felt that something wasn't right, something bad was going to happen. A gut feel, as I would say. But, nothing happened. So I couldn't do anything but to wait like a sitting duck to what's to happen. In hindsight, I wished I had listened to my own gut feeling and transfered AWAY from the school. Hindsight always give you a 20/20 view, as they say.

It started with the small things, friends backstabbing. That's how I started secondary 2. Certain friend, who I shall refer her as W, wasn't happy that I was sitting with another friend in class, so she complained to the teacher, told her I was 'bullying' her. Forced me to go thru 'mediation' until my mother had it and told the teachers to 'fuck themselves' in a politically correct manner.

W and I patched, but that's not the end of the story. I had quit my former CCA, and joined scouts. W also did that too, so we ended up as CCA mates. I was... uncomfortable... so I just avoided her. W was the one who initiated the conversation, I just rode along. Hindsight again, I wished I had better taste in friends.

Scouts, oh darned scouts. That's when I met T, the 'golden' boy and fellow member of the CCA I was attending. Yet again it started with the small things, like him catcalling and him making all sorts of lewd comments about my body. I didn't think of much, as what the teachers said, 'boys will be boys.' 

I soon quit scouts due to even more drama brought indirectly by W. In my 'resignation' letter, I wrote about what W's friend did, as well as what T said. Yet again being the foolish sec 2, I didn't 'capture evidence' and just handed the resignation letter as it is.

It soon progresses into 'accidentally' or should I say, planned 'accidents'. Once brush, close an eye. Twice touch, it's a lie. I didn't know how to approach it. I don't have evidence, or even one witness. I chose to remain silent, which is something I still regret to this day. 

I started with a goal in mind for secondary 3. To get my 2 CCA points, clock as much volunteer hours and maintain at least As and Bs overall. Hah, as if I could achieve such godly goals.

Then, the opportunity came. The scouts teacher, Miss T, persuaded me to return, in exchange for a leadership position, in her words 'I guarantee you 2 points'. I bit onto her bait hard, like a trusting moron. I told her about what T tried to do to me in sec 2, because I trusted her. She told me she'll settle it.

She never did. 

The smaller problems snowballed from just words to action. T starts with random touches up the forbidden area. I couldn't scream for help, cause my voice just drowned out in a crowded canteen. The irony, I know.

It happened in broad daylight again, this time in front of my class. He rubbed possible human reproduction material onto my skirt. I went speechless. I... I didn't know how to react.

I, yet again, chose to be silent. Instead, I laughed away my sorrows with another mutual friend met thru W, I shall refer to him as J. Everytime I chased him around, and vice versa, I just forgot all about what happened. All the teasing and fun times. That was probably the reason why I didn't go insane.

Everytime it happened, I chose to stay silent. Because I believed that the scouts teacher would do something, she kept on promising and promising. Nothing ever happened.

T got bolder and bolder, the final time getting his group of friends to corner me in the canteen whilst I was queuing. T whispered in my ear, 'something something about my pantak (ass),' I didn't fully understand what he was saying, but knew he was talking about my body. All 6 of his friends took turns grabbing, until I snapped and slapped one of them before storming off. I had it. I no longer wanted to wait for promises that were never fulfilled. I decided it was time to escalate.

The final straw that broke the camel's back.

On the day I was supposed to tell the other scouts teacher, Miss L, about what T had been doing to me, I found out that Miss T had been making empty promises to keep me in the CCA. Remember she promised all sorts of 'positions' that'll guarantee my CCA points? That was a lie. Guess who they gave my promised position to? T. The golden boy. I wouldn't be so mad (maybe betrayed at most) had T regularly attended CCA. Fuck, no. He didn't even turn up for a single session the entire of sec 3. This sent me into pure hysterics, sobs and questions.

Why. What did I do wrong. What did T do to make he worthy of that position. Where did I go wrong. Why.

I sat on the staircase, sobbing and pretty much hugging the only emotional pillar I had, the railings. W and J came, W just stood there emotionless (she also didn't get a leadership position, expected, due to her attendance and attitude to scouts) whilst J tried to comfort me. It didn't help.

All the shit I endured. All the hours I poured into this CCA, the money I lost when I chose to forgo my holiday for a CCA camp that'll increase my chances of the leadership position. All the hours after session I spent practising on footdrills. The weekends I burnt memorizing drill commands.

I realized I only endured the harassment because of my ambition. My selfish goals. I didn't care about the price I had to pay, I only gave a shit about scouts, and my CCA points. I paid the final price with my sanity.

With my sanity slipping away, my only train of thoughts was to seek justice for myself. What I had lost, what another girl could have experienced because I chose to stay silent for the sake of my petty ambitions.

I approached Miss L, and told her everything that T had done. She was shocked, and asked me in chinese, when it happened. Just like what happened with Miss T, Miss L never did anything. They promised, yet nothing happened.

The mental abuse from my Chinese teacher truly broke the camel's back. Call it an unorthodox method of punishment or abuse, its up to your judgement. I was falling back on my homework because I spent every night in bed crying. As such, the Chinese teacher began confiscating my ezlink card and handphone. I was paying adult fare on a kids budget. There was even one time I had to BEG from a random stranger at a terminal for 1 dollar because I didn't have enough money. 

This pretty much pushed me to the edge. I stayed up for 72 hours (skipped school, got an MC) and finished every single essay I owed to her. On that Friday (remember it clear as day), I handed everything I owed to her. She said she'll return my belongings on Monday. Comes Monday, the chinese teacher claims I did NOT submit any essay to her despite having the class remind her that I did. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday passed. She found all my essays except one. She then claims I didn't write it, and CONFISCATES my entire SCHOOL BAG, and threatens to confiscate my uniform if I don't hand it by Friday. I was left carrying a thick stack of textbook, semi-sobbing before finally breaking down to my mother.

My mother then promptly writes into the school (at this point she doesn't know about the harassment), demanding that the teacher returns my belonging and compensate me for my adult fare. The vice principal made her return every item she took from me, and made sure she didn't dare to pull another stunt like that again. Lo and behold, she lost my spare ezlink card. So she just handed me another random NETS credit card card that doesn't belong me and told me to 'Èó≠‰Ω†ÁãóÂò¥' (shut my f*cking mouth) and don't complain.

I ended up flunking every single sec 3 finals, and only passing bare minimum to get me promoted. First time failing in my life. Still feels surreal till this day.

A TL;DR of what happened in 2019/2020 (idw go into details, not ready yet heh), start of sec 4: Searched for transfers, a school is willing to take me in provided the principal approves. The sperm donor (father) doesn't believe me even after I have a c** stained skirt as evidence. School pretends to 'investigate' case to lure me back to school. Both scouts teachers pretended as if I never told them about what happened, the CCA department 'mysterious' lost my resignation letter back in sec 2 that clearly stated what T had been doing. Principal traps me with other friend W (she was also looking for school to transfer) in a white room for more than 10 hours, starts interrogating both as if we committed some big crime. Starts yelling and told me 'it's a form of love to be stalked and touched' after I revealed that T stalked me outside of school (briefly mentioned to both scouts teachers). Makes W break down, fail to make me cry because I had already cut myself emotionally off. Yells again until she probably went out of breath before sending both out. Whilst all these yelling, I had recorded her actual meltdown and was planning to use it as evidence. W sabotages my plan (didn't know at that time), told the principal that I was recording her. Phone got forcefully searched, recording got deleted. School pretends to investigate the harassment case, a few witnesses step forward but was silenced off. Even HEARD the DM told another former scout member to stay silent about the harassment if he wants to keep his leadership position. Was forced to join another CCA, threatened to call the police on me if I refused to join. Placed in the middle of a class full of strangers, freaked out when one of them (later learnt it was an autistic kid, wished I hadn't publicly freaked out) came running at me at full speed and had a huge meltdown.

A rough summary of the 'traumatic' parts, without the gross details. Because I chose to come forward, the principal started targeting me. I was given a poor conduct grade despite never having any discipline/criminal case. My grades were 'modified', where I never passed again. I was forcefully placed into basic Chinese just because I failed in one test.

Thankfully, I managed to fought my way back to normal chinese. Luckily I had taken HCL back in PSLE and scored pretty much straight As in lower sec, or else I might have ended up permanently in basic Chinese and that'll screw my L1R4 score.

At this point, W was still my friend. My mother hated her. She apparently caught W in a lie: W claimed that she never did a mental assessment at IMH. In my mother's conversation with the principal, she was told W had gone to IMH, had a mental assessment, went up to the superintendent with this report and tried to transfer.

I was in denial. I started noticing things that were obvious red flags, emails between W's mother and the principal that had my name and J's, her mutual and only friend other than me. It then hit me, W will do anything and everything to get out of this school, even if it cost me.

Yet again, another few more weeks of crying and denial. I still remained W's friend, because I didn't want to believe she was capable of such backstabbing. I should have just unfriended her. If she can backstab me in sec 2, what is one more time?

In Science class, J and I started becoming closer. Occasionally we would talk and fool around. I started looking forward to Mondays and Wednesdays, because that's the days I actually had real company, away from my backstabbing horror of a class and W. We remained a row apart, because I never wanted to sit anywhere close to anybody after what had happened.

July. I remember this day as clear as day. After morning form teacher class, all the tables were joined back but they were short of my pair of table. So I sat on the left side of J's table. He just looked, I just looked. Nothing happened, I continued scribbling notes (kept on having flashbacks of what happened) and used my paper cutter to repeatedly slice the top of my paper. J asked if I was okay. Internally, I was a mess. On the outside, I just said yeah.

A friendship bloomed, only waiting for the flower to wither and die.

Over the next few weeks, I started becoming more and more paranoid. I enjoyed the company of J in class, but wondered if he was just my friend to seek out information like W. Yet, I still remained somewhat close.

I never fully trusted J, which is probably the reason why this friendship started to fall apart. I tried really, really, really hard to tell J what exactly happened in scouts but never did. It's just a gapping hole of trust that was broken that stopped me from trusting anyone again. I even forced myself to sit at the staircase he collects his lunch everyday, hoping one day I can finally tell him the truth. I never did.

Eventually I believe he heard half truths from the person that I had the most trust from, W. I only knew that W went around telling EVERYBODY about what happened in scouts when one of my acquaintance accidentally blurted out T's name and the skirt, which is only known to W, the school and I.

It was the date of MTL result release. I pretty much flew into a rage, almost punching W if I had one strand of self control less in me. After that, I just shut down and had a massive breakdown in a random unoccupied classroom.

Not even my MTL results made my day any better. By hook or crook I had passed. On a normal day I would have felt happy. Now, I was just murky on the inside and outside.

The rest of the year passed in a blur. Ever since that day, I had shut down emotionally and mentally. I distanced myself from J, and pretty much everybody. Nobody could hurt me anymore if I don't feel any pain, and that's what I did. Eventually J and I drifted, we sat for our O levels and left the school, leaving too many unspoken words between us.

The current

Mentally, I'm still exhausted because of my chaotic home environment. The sperm donor makes my life a living hell. Emotionally, I still don't feel things. I simply don't trust anymore, so I can't get hurt again. The closest I've came to feeling something was when I heard from my former classmates that T had touched another girl inappropriately. The only feeling I had was pain. If only I had spoken earlier that other girl wouldn't have gone thru what I had.

Part of me is looking forward to poly, yet my paranoid side tells me that the past will come back and haunt me. Yes, I'm worried that I will lose out opportunities because of what the evil principal had done to me (bad conduct grade). I used to get nightmares that W would be in the same course as I am. I'm scared that I'll trust the wrong friends, and see history repeat itself again.

I've been living as if I were dead for 2 years. I think it's time for me to open up and be a functioning human again. I think this post pretty much marks the end of me re-living everyday in this nightmare. It's time to let go. 

*A small message to J, whether you're reading this or not: I'm thankful that we met in sec sch, although it was in shit circumstances. I'm sorry for not trusting you. Thank you for leaving me with at least 1 good memory of sec sch. Also, I'm sorry that I slapped you. I wish I wasn't sensitive, I wish at that time I had known you weren't the bad guy. I wish my paranoia hadn't killed this friendship. I hope you're doing well wherever you are.*

Tysm for listening to my rant. It's just June and reality is hitting me. In around 8 months it'll be the end of my mental break year and it's time for me to face my biggest fears, trusting and people.

a few weeks ago, i was a j1 student whose life was completely engulfed by studying for promos: every waking moment was filled with worries about the exam, whether it be what else i hadn't studied yet, or paranoia of what will come.

the sleep that i so needed was eaten away by feelings of anxiety that strangled my heart until i had difficulty breathing.

i think i wasn't in my right mind back then. i studied from 9am to 9pm, save for a lunch break, but during which i stared at my revision materials while i ate.

yet, because my mind was only filled with thoughts of studying, nothing else could enter. (thankfully?) previous feelings of social anxiety etc. seemed meaningless. who cares about socialising when i had to revise 1000 more topics in a few hours?

unfortunately, thoughts still started to fill my mind. 

i remember that one of those nights, as i went to sleep, i started to feel my heart restricting. it continued until i felt like i wouldn't be able to breathe, but luckily this ordeal only lasted for a few seconds.

but in those few seconds, i remember feeling fearful and regretful. my last memory was memorizing for exams. i couldn't even remember the last time i smiled or had fun or genuinely enjoyed life.

i was scared. life is short, i realized. and at that moment to me, studying seemed meaningless. when you die, you don't remember the grade you got on that exam you worried so much for. that would be meaningless.

existential dread filled me up there - have i been toiling away for something i won't even remember? what should i do instead then? is it too late? did i waste too much of my time?

i struggled with such thoughts the rest of the time studying for promos. luckily, after promos ended, and i could finally breathe, those thoughts didn't seem to invade my space anymore.

but alas, life doesn't give you peace easily. i know i screwed up my promos and as promo results start to loom and crawl nearer and nearer, i know there's a possibility i might retain. legitimately.

but then again, what meaning does promo results bear? in comparison to the 16+ years that i've lived, what makes the grades on a piece of paper that will mean nothing to me in a year as i prepare for a levels, more meaningful than any other moment? on what grounds does my anxiety feed on?

and so on. such thoughts fill my mind now. this all just feels like a meaningless loop. what actually has meaning?

this is literally just a whole brain dump, but i needed somewhere to rant.

Since a decent number of people ended up enjoying it, I'll be posting the other parts of the review over the next few days. 

As with last time, since I'm an ignorant American with no personal experience of Singapore and only LKY's word to go on for much of the detail provided, I'd be particularly interested to hear where I oversimplified things or where people would contest this interpretation of events. Note as well that, since I initially wrote this to an international audience, throughout the essay I assume rather less familiarity with Singapore than you all have.

With those notes taken care of, enjoy the review!

###You are Free to Agree

Are you a fan of free speech? Are you eager for everyone to have a platform? Are you in favor of an open, unconstrained press? 

Lee Kuan Yew isn't, and he's probably poking fun at you.

######Free Press

Here are a few of his choicest quotes on Western-style free press:

> My early experiences in Singapore and Malaya shaped my views about the claim of the press to be the defender of truth and freedom of speech. The freedom of the press was the freedom of its owners to advance their personal and class interests. ^\(186)

And: 

> I did not accept that newspaper owners had the right to print whatever they liked. Unlike Singapore's ministers, they and their journalists were not elected. ...I do not subscribe to the Western practice that allows a wealthy press baron to decide what voters should read day after day. ^\(191)

And, when he got into an argument with the US State Department:

> The State Department repeated that it did not take sides; it was merely expressing concern because of its ""fundamental and long-standing commitment to the principles of a free and unrestricted press""--which meant that ""the press is free to publish or not publish what it chooses however irresponsible or biased its actions may seem to be."" ^\(192)

All that's pretty straightforward, and clearly goes against the principles of free speech, right? Then you get to the next quote:

> *We have always banned communist publications; no Western media or media organization has ever protested against this.* We have not banned any Western newspaper or journal. Yet they frequently refused us the right of reply when they misreported us. ^\(191)

Here's a question. You're a tiny city-state occupying valuable territory, trying to stay independent. You are watching the cultural revolution sweep across the homeland of three-quarters of your people, and you [keep noticing them funding your newspapers](https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/17/archives/paper-in-singapore-ceases-publication-red-link-charged.html). Meanwhile, other superpowers are locked in an all-out ideological struggle with those forces, a struggle that's shaping policy around the whole world. The country's dominant English-language newspaper at the time of gaining independence was ""owned by the British and actively promoted their interests."" ^\(185)

What's the right level of freedom of press?

Keeping in mind that the book is telling things from LKY's perspective and so naturally seeks to cast his decisions favorably, his position has some nuances that make it easy to be sympathetic. First, there's a different standard for local and foreign media: ""We had to tolerate locally owned newspapers that criticized us; we accepted their bona fides, because they had to stay and suffer the consequences of their policies. Not so 'the birds of passage who run [foreign-owned papers].'"" ^\(187)

Second, as he mentions above, he didn't ban non-Communist foreign press. Not exactly. Instead, every time a paper refused right of reply for a story he felt was misrepresented or slanted, he just restricted sales licenses to smaller numbers, with an eye towards reducing advertising revenue but not towards outright banning the ideas. This led to occasionally amusing exchanges. In one back-and-forth, after the Asian Wall Street Journal (AWSJ) published an alleged defamatory article and had sales restricted, the AWSJ offered to distribute its journal free to its deprived subscribers to ""forego its sales revenue in the spirit of helping Singapore businessmen"". Singapore's government agreed, as long as it left out advertisements. The paper backed out, claiming cost issues. Singapore offered to cover half the additional costs. When the paper refused, Singapore gave an official response: ""You are not interested in the business community getting information. You want the freedom to make money selling advertisements."" ^\(193)

Third, well, it's only paranoia if you're wrong. In addition to facing consistent attempts at covert communist influence, I learned post-reading that Lee Kuan Yew had [at least one memorable run-in with the CIA](http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/Security-CIA-II/CIA%20II%20013.pdf) (h/t [/r/singapore](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2zzlz3/til_cia_tried_to_bribe_mr_lee_kuan_yew_and_got/)). In 1960, they offered him $3.3 million to cover up a failed attempt to buy information from Singapore intelligence officials. Lee's response? ""The Americans should know the character of the men they are dealing with in Singapore and not get themselves further dragged into calumny. ...You do not buy and sell this Government."" Never one to ignore leverage, he requested that instead of covert bribes the US provide public foreign aid. They complied.

Dystopian information lockdown, or prudent defense against foreign influence and misinformation? LKY is convinced, rightly or not, that it is the latter. Read with modern US politics in mind, it's easy to compare it to deplatformings from tech websites, concerns about Russian infiltration of social media, or the controversies around fake news. The context changes, the challenges stay the same.

######Free Speech

I frankly have much less sympathy for LKY's eagerness to sue people for libel. It's worth mentioning that Singapore has avoided one obvious concern about relying on courts here: [corruption is almost non-existent in Singapore](https://www.transparency.org/cpi2018), and deliberately so. We may come back to corruption later, since LKY does spend some time on it. Still, there's something unsettling about the leader of a country keeping a hawk's eye watch for anything that misrepresents him, then turning the power of the courts on the individual or newspaper who went after him.

He talks about a fair number of legal battles with evident satisfaction, about taking this opponent or that who accused him or corruption or lied about him to court, then winning the battles. He anticipates the obvious criticism about this practice, and defends against it:

> Had I not sued, these allegations would have gained credence. ...Outrageous statements are disbelieved only because they are vigorously refuted. If I failed to sue, that ould be cited as proof that there was something in it. ...Wrong ideas have to be challenged before they influence public opinion and make for problems. ^\(130-131)

And: 

> Far from oppressing the opposition or the press that unjustly attacked my reputation, I have put my private and public life under close scrutiny whenever I appeared as a plaintiff in court. Without a clear record, it would have been an unnecessary hazard. Because I did this and also gave the damages awarded to deserving charities, I kept my standing with our people. ^\(131)

Left unspoken, though, is that *he's the one who's in charge of this whole system of lawsuits.* Vigorous refutation of an idea can happen in writing, in speeches, in any number of official channels. If he wants to keep his public and private life open to scrutiny, he can do so however he chooses. Electing to wage time-consuming and costly legal battles against people who put forward unsavory ideas is hardly the only choice for the most powerful man in a country, and it's a choice that I feel warrants skepticism.

I'm much more fond of his response to a London Times reporter who made accusations he disputed (emphases mine): 

> I wrote to invite Levin to a live television debate in London on his allegations. Levin's editor replied that no television station would be interested. *I had taken the precaution of first writing to the chairman of the BBC*, my friend Marmaduke Hussey, who had agreed to provide half an hour and a neutral moderator. When I informed the London Times of this offer, the editor on Levin's behalf backed off, arguing that my response should be in the same medium in which Levin had attacked me, namely the Times. I wrote to regret Levin's unwillingness to confront me. *When the* Times *refused to publish my letter, I bought a half-page advertisement in the British daily, the* Independent. Interviewed on the BBC World Service, I said, ""Where I come from, if an accuser is not prepared to face the person he has attacked, there is nothing more to be said.""

> Levin has not written about Singapore or me since. ^\(196)

There's something delightful about the image of a politician going up to a reporter and saying, in effect, ""Heard you were talking smack. Debate me, you coward.""

Another instance shows up, by the way, in which it's hard to make assumptions about Singapore. Given LKY's desire for control over media messaging, you might expect some sort of overreaction to the internet. Instead, his message comes with characteristic bluntness: ""Countries that try to block the use of IT will lose."" ^\(196) 

######On nanny states

One last topic remains to be covered here. From banning everything from drugs to tobacco advertising to chewing gum to [eating durian in public spaces](https://www.yearofthedurian.com/2014/10/llegal-durians-how-much-trouble-wi.html), Singapore has inevitably faced accusations of being a ""nanny state.""

LKY has this to say on the subject:

> Foreign correspondents in Singapore have no big scandals of corruption or grave wrongdoings to report. Instead they reported on the fervor and frequency of these ""do good"" campaigns, ridiculing Singapore as a ""nanny state."" They laughed at us. I was confident we would have the last laugh. We would have been a grosser, ruder, cruder society had we not made these efforts to persuade our people to change their ways. We did not measure up as a cultivated, civilized society and were not ashamed to set about trying to become one in the shortest time possible. First, we educated and exhorted our people. After we had persuaded and won over a majority, we legislated to punish the willful minority. It has made Singapore a more pleasant place to live in. **If this is a ""nanny state,"" I am proud to have fostered one.** ^\(183)

To rephrase: ""Yep, we're a nanny state. Works great. Any questions?""

I'll repeat my prior explanation of LKY's approach: Will a policy make people more self-sufficient, more capable, or safer? Ultimately, does it work? Oh, and does it make everybody furious?

Great, do that. 

On a world scale, I think I would be uncomfortable with this sort of standard. I believe in the importance of creating robust societies where a wide range of ideas can thrive, and this sort of deliberately limited culture doesn't really provide that. But part of creating robust systems is questioning assumptions and experimenting with dramatically different approaches. I'm from Utah, ground zero for Mormonism and its strict standards. As such, I grew up in a similarly self-restricting and proud ""nanny state"". While it wasn't right for me in the end, for a lot of people I'm close with, those unambiguous strict standards work *really, really well* in a way that ""eh, just do what makes you happy"" doesn't. A single city of five and a half million people seems to me just about the right size to run that sort of experiment.

###Interlude Two

While reading the book and looking a bit into Singapore, I came across a few pieces of info that don't fit naturally into a review but deserve at least a moment's attention. One is the matter of Singapore's airport.

You might recall from my first review a brief mention of Lee Kuan Yew's focus on first impressions so people would ""know that Singaporeans were competent, disciplined, and reliable... without a word being said"" ^\(62). Singapore's Changi airport takes that to its natural conclusion. He was determined to make Singapore a transport hub of the region and decided to write off their investments in an older airport to perfect Changi in a number of details. After seeing Boston's Logan Airport, for example, he reported being ""impressed that the noise footprint of planes landing and taking off was over water"" ^\(203) and adjusting plans accordingly. In the end, they spent six years and $1.5 billion constructing the airport in a sort of [anti-Brandenburg](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20181030-what-happened-to-berlins-ghost-airport) approach.

And (h/t [elsewhere on reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/cam405/airport_in_singapore_has_a_slide_that_will_take/)): The airport is *wild.* Features include: [multi-story slides](https://i.imgur.com/cm4zskR.gifv), a massive playground of [climbing nets](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/changi-unveils-new-playground-featuring-ropes-nets-and-a-pole-at-t4), an indoor playground and [waterfall](https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/04/jewel-changi-airport-pix.png), [hedge mazes and canopy bridges](http://mentalfloss.com/article/501651/singapore%E2%80%99s-airport-getting-two-different-garden-mazes), and, well, [just about everything else](http://www.changiairport.com/en/discover/attractions.html#/filter?tab=all). Oh, and it has airplanes too. It's been ranked pretty consistently as [the best airport in the world](https://www.worldairportawards.com/worlds-top-10-airports-2019/). 

Until next time.

If they would turn away from temptation, they could be normal again. If only they would try, and try harder, if it doesn't work.""

These were the words said by Mary Griffith to her son, Bobby Griffith, in the movie ""Prayers for Bobby"" - a story of a how Mary Griffith, staunch Christian Mom of Bobby Griffith, fights to cure her gay son of his homosexuality. Bobby eventually spirals into depression and self-loathing. One night, he falls off a bridge on a highway into the path of an oncoming truck, which kills him instantly.

I still remember that afternoon, almost ten years ago by now. My mom and I were in the car on Grange Road, just about to turn left into Ngee Ann City. This was during the aftermath of the AWARE saga in Singapore (AWARE is a women's organization in Singapore. in 2009, a group of right-wing Christians orchestrated a takeover protest of their sexual education material in which same-sex attraction was deemed OK). The radio was covering the story and asked for listeners to call in with their views on the matter. After listening to the cover, my mom at the steering wheel turned to me and said a sentence I will never forget.

""These homosexuals are evil, and they should burn in hell.""

I understand that in staunchly religious households, such words would not have been uncommon. However, what affected me was the speed, the surprise, and the suddenness of it all. I was minding my own business in the car, and in that single sentence, the mom that I knew for twenty years was gone. In her stead I could only see someone else - caring in same way, but it never felt like the same person that I could trust. If this person found out about my secret, what would happen to me? I dared not find out.

To my mom, it was an off-handed comment that she probably won't remember. But to me, it felt like my entire world was upended.

Have you watched the Pixar movie, Inside Out? Central to the movie was the idea of core memories, which were key moments in one's life that shape one's personality. This very moment, to me, became one of them. The suddenness of the topic and the vitriol in her voice was unforgettable. This memory has stuck to me till this very day, almost ten years down the road.

If you're gay, no one is safe, not even from their families. The world felt a lot darker, and a lot more dangerous.

I stayed silent for the rest of the journey. At the time, it was only a few more months until it was time for me to go to America to pursue my undergraduate studies. It was in that very moment, I vowed to myself that I *must* keep my secret away from family. I knew that had my parents found out, there was a real danger that they would cut off funding to me and call me back because they would assume I was 'influenced by the western agenda' - even though I already knew starting in secondary school!

For the next four years, I bided my time in college. I did call back to my parents, but I hated the idea of doing so. I figured that the less I share about my life, the less likely my parents would find out, and I could graduate in peace. The goal was to remain closeted until I was financially independent, and I succeeded. I am fortunate to come from a financially stable family. My parents have absolutely no need for me to support them for retirement. Hence, my primary concern was to establish a stable income for myself. It was only through freedom of a stable income could I not rely on the parents that could possibly kick me out for being gay. Was that paranoia? True, it was highly unlikely for my family. But it was a chance I could not afford to take.

Overall, I had a good college experience. Back in Singapore, my church, while not outwardly hateful, did weigh in on the topic of homosexuality with the usual quotes from Leviticus, along with a sprinkle of ""lifestyle"", ""choice"", and (my personal favorite) ""hate the sin, not the sinner."" At least I could now enjoy my Sundays, without the occasional self-denigration from the pulpit.

But the past sermons and that memory continued to affect me. Night after night, I called out to God and asked him why? Why couldn't I, like the Book of Mormon musical, ""turn it off""? It certainly didn't feel like a choice. If it was, why burden me with such a choice when everyone else seems to have it easy? Is this God‚Äôs cruel punishment on me for something else? I always wondered what would have happened if I was born gay in a different environment. I read of Matthew Shepherd, the American student who was beaten, tortured, and left to die. I read of news about ISIS, where brothers and parents threw their gay families off buildings. Some friends dismissed it as the work of crazy people. All I could think of was that car drive on Grange Road. I could not shake off the look in her eyes. Perhaps society is just a few laws away from craziness, after all.

Four years passed and I got my degree with distinction. I returned back to Singapore, with a stable job waiting for me - mission accomplished! But shortly after, my dad decided to have a private talk with me - one of the few he's ever had with me his entire life. He inquired why I felt so distant, so different from the boy he once knew. My mom, who was always a worrywart, has visibly aged since four years ago. Because I have become so distant and resistant to communication, she worried even more in my absence.

I was not ready to share the real reason why I was so silent. I clammed up again. I felt no motivation to share my reason anymore. I have survived four years without sharing my life. Why start now? I have learned to stop caring about sharing my life with my parents.

Shortly, my mom found out about my sexuality. I gathered it was probably due to my over-zealous sharing of Pink Dot posts on Facebook (I didn‚Äôt really care about them finding out at this point). One day, my Mom confronted me about it. When she took my silence to be a ‚Äòyes‚Äô, while holding back tears, the first words out of her mouth were ""We shouldn't have sent you to the U.S."" In the end, my prior fears were not unfounded. In that moment, I felt validated - validated that my strategy for those four years was not unfounded and could have saved me from an early withdrawal from school.

Thankfully, for me, it was a (reasonably) happy end. After the tears, she said that while she can't approve of my 'lifestyle' due to the church, she did say that she still loves me.

Overall, I count myself as one of the lucky ones. Besides this incident, my parents have given me every material need, the necessary attention, and tools needed to succeed in life. I was never thrown out of the house, beaten as child, nor been assaulted on the street (yet). However, I cannot say the same for some of my friends and the greater gay community as a whole. I have no illusions; I've had a great life so far. But if that single moment on Grange Road still affects me ten years after, I am sure that some other son, in some other less privileged family, with less money, less love, and denied opportunities to stay hidden, would have it much worse. ""Prayers for Bobby"" was based off a true story, after all.

Hence, for those who believe that 377A is 'just a symbol', then consider yourself even more fortunate than I am. To many, 377A is not 'just a symbol'. For some, 377A has become the flag in which the religious right is using to rally its supporters. For some, 377A is a constant reminder that we feel less like citizens but more like a bargaining chip to the government. For some, 377A has become the perfect veil for others say hurtful, ignorant comments with little repercussions on sunny little Singapore.

To me, it is clear: day after day, 377A is a sum of all of the above. It is a constant reminder that we are alone against our bullies.

To the religious who believe that repealing 377A will lead to the moral decay of Singapore, the story of ""Prayers for Bobby"" does not end at Bobby's death. Marry Griffith desperately searches for answers to her son's death and eventually realizes that it was her hurtful words that drove her own son to suicide. She shares in her closing speech:

""Unknown to you, they will be listening, as you echo 'amen'. And that will soon silence their prayers. Their prayers to God for understanding, and acceptance, and for your love. But your hatred, and fear, and ignorance of the word 'gay' will silence their prayers. So, before you echo 'amen' in your home, and place of worship, think. Think, and remember. A child is listening.""

So if you've read all the way to this point, please remember that even if you are a regular churchgoer with no contact with the gay community, I am sure that someone you know and love is being hurt by your very actions. It could be one of the quiet kids sitting in the corner every Sunday School. It could be your best friend, your cousin who's never seemed to have a girlfriend. Above all, it could be your son who you never suspected a bit. And just like every mention of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 from the pulpit, I can tell you from personal experience that each mention of 377A along with the ""hate the sin, not the sinner"" rhetoric will chip away at that kids self-esteem and self-worth.

So let the movie ""Prayers for Bobby"" be a cautionary tale. The real damage to society will not come from the moral decay that you speak of. It will come from the erosion of trust between you and the children that you never knew were listening to your words all along. As Mary Griffith realized too late, you can't turn back the clock once the deed has been done.

But unlike Mary Griffith's situation, the Singapore story does not end... yet. The absence of 377A itself will also be a new symbol. A symbol that a secular Singapore with religions preaching harmony and not division as the way forward. A symbol that the government does not make short-term voter gains at the expense of minority citizens. A symbol that gay people are no longer defined by a law 'gross indecency' but are finally reduced to mere human beings, just like everyone else.

And for those who aren't LGBT and are quiet or ambivalent about showing your support, we do need your help to drown out the noise of bigotry. Just as how my experience was traumatic and drove me back to hiding, your outward show of support, whether you realize it or not, is a huge deal for those around you who are still closeted and in hiding. It will give them less and less reasons to hide. The single raindrop never feels responsible for the flood, but with your help, I pray that the tide will turn sooner.

18,alqbjf,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378515,cryptonitr,False,public,,Our Reality (LGBT Youths in Singapore),"Why is this our new normal? Why does Singapore, a country I love so dearly, feel so backward? As a fellow gay Singaporean and JC student, this whole TMJC saga is legit outrageous.

For last few years, as I discovered my sexuality, each news story, every conversation about the LGBT community, becomes this huge deal. The TMJC boys being vilified on Hardware Zone just shows the worst of Singaporean culture. 

The reality is, we sit in our classrooms, studying the same standardized tests as everyone else, wondering why some of our teachers do not have open conversations about LGBT issues in General Paper (just as an example). Or should we be trained to see a ‚Äúright‚Äù and ‚Äúsocially accepted‚Äù peachy view of the world? 

The reality is, even if our friends are LGBT-friendly, we do not have the tools, the capabilities to open up conversations with them. For fear of being outcast. And if we do, we soften our voices, for we are afraid of being too needy. Too attention-seeking. Too ‚Äúgay-centric‚Äù. 

The reality is, that if our parents find a photo circulating online, where a partner shows a display of innocent affection, a simple peck on the cheek, we have to wonder whether they would back us up when the backlash ensues. When the online trolls burst onto forums, holding up this picture as if it was Simba from the Lion King, we have to wonder what our families would think. It‚Äôs a feeling of paranoia you would never shake off.

We need to face the hard truths of our generation. LGBT people feel disenfranchised. Left out.

At this point, some self-proclaimed ‚Äúcommon sense logician‚Äù will stop me to say that this is all emotional jargon. That I am making a sob story out of this whole post. And so? Does an appeal to emotions not mean an appeal to the fundamentals of being human? Sentient beings who have the unique ability to feel, understand and connect like no other species. And yet, we choose to be divisive. Brilliant haha.

>Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said that there is no discrimination against the LGBT community ‚Äúat work, housing (and) education‚Äù here in Singapore (TODAYOnline, 2018). 

I hold great respect for the Minister, but I am puzzled by his statement on this. 

For purposes of relevant discussion, I shall only talk about the TMJC photo. I do not wish to speculate, but if the story that a police report was threatened to filed against the TMJC boys, it is a clear act of fearmongering. To uphold a certain ‚Äúmoral value set‚Äù. It is doubtful that there would be any clarity on this matter for transparency is not the strongest suit of the system, but the mere accusation speaks volumes.

If and when a student decides to show support for the LGBT community, there is a clear mental block. We need to filter out our content to be ‚Äúschool-friendly‚Äù or risk some form of reprimand. I understand that profanity may be problematic for the school‚Äôs reputation. But a post on PinkDot? Or a post with PDA as a gay couple? Is that really ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù? 

Does the statement where Goh Chok Tong mentioned that the civil service encouraged gays to join up in 2003 (mind you, I was 3 years old) still hold up (TIME, 2003)? Or do the beneficiaries of civil service, in particular students studying in MOE-approved and supported schools, not have that same freedom of expression? 

We are exhausted from the constant mixed signals. Growing up gay in Singapore is extremely confusing. I only knew Kumar when I was growing up and I thought that was the epitome of ‚Äúgay people‚Äù. Turns out I was completely off the mark. I was taught also that having a certain stance indicated ‚ÄúTHE BIG GAY‚Äù. Again, wrong.

It‚Äôs a well-known fact that LGBT youths are more likely to succumb to mental health issues as well. Sexual minority youth are 3.5 times as likely to attempt suicide as heterosexual peers (CNA/Reuters, 2018). This is no coincidence. It is a systemic pressure to conform to a sexual preference.

And I‚Äôm worried. For the TMJC peers of mine, whether they would have necessary access to school counsellors who may or may not disclose private information to the school administration if they need assistance. Is there confidentiality? Over the years, there have been many personal stories in my own JC where students (for a wide variety of issues) have felt unsatisfied and even betrayed by mental health assistance in schools. Eventually, a whole range of teachers would be informed. With no consent. 

It seems to the ordinary person reading this that I am but one of the ‚Äúvocal minority‚Äù. However, I do understand why it takes time to implement changes or move forward on LGBT rights in Singapore. We are a nation rooted upon the basis of (generally) civil discourse and discussion. Yet, I feel it has becoming increasingly hostile in the midst of the LGBT debate.

On both sides, there has been too much vitriol. My own community has been increasingly pointed in language and rhetoric to those that do not agree. Comments dismissing others as ‚Äújust homophobes‚Äù or ‚ÄúLow SES uneducated scum‚Äù are disgusting. These don‚Äôt value add to the discussion. You are shutting others out, when instead we should seek a dialogue.

We are all Singaporeans. That is the baseline. And we cannot allow ourselves to descend into an individualistic culture (I‚Äôm looking at you, America) where it is all he-said-she-said. It must be calculated and careful on both sides. As a society, we may not be perfect, but we have shown over the years that the majority can live harmoniously. What is stopping us from doing so now? (:

Furthermore, we all value love. And affection. Regardless of who we are. We value family, filial piety and hard work amongst all else. These are the same things any Singaporean, straight or a lil‚Äô queer can identify with. I remember when the landmark decision ‚Äì which granted two gay fathers in Singapore to adopt their surrogate son ‚Äì came out (haha) in the papers, I cried. Because that‚Äôs my own dream. To have a family. To feel part of a country I love. To feel valued and respected.

Love doesn‚Äôt win if we cannot learn to love and respect the people we meet. For if we are so bent upon achieving equality and justice, we must do so we compassion. With dignity and pride in doing the right thing. 

My final thoughts? I hope that one day, these trivial matters like an Instagram post aren‚Äôt means for baseless and unproductive argument. And that Singaporeans can finally see that LGBT people are just like anyone else. 

For now, this is our reality. And I guess, tomorrow, I‚Äôll still be standing at the Parade Square, proudly singing my national anthem and reciting the Pledge with my schoolmates. But silently, I hope one day, I‚Äôll be the patriot that fully believes in his country. In the rights that he can be afforded.

*For now, this is our discontented reality.*

so now that all my written papers for As are over, im part relieved and, a bigger part of me, annoyed (and disappointed). while I left the exam venue feeling that most of our papers were rather fine, i somehow end up making TONS of mistakes along the way. these can range from careless calculation errors to realising that i, in fact, do know how to do the question that I thought I didnt know how to do.

and the scariest part is, i can never resist the temptation to come on reddit after the papers to look at the discussions for the papers. because of this, I end up seeing the answers everyone else gets, and for some reason, the answers are never familiar to me. it's almost like I sat through an entirely different paper. I start having the feeling of paranoia that I screwed up my papers more than I thought, and the papers I thought I did fine in, are really not that great after all. which leaves the papers that I found horrible... well.

ive never been the smart one in the friend group, or in school I should say. my grades in school were average at best, and among the lower quartile at worst. while I'm not aiming to get into the most competitive courses like medicine and dentistry, I want to get really decent grades, as i have no idea what I'm interested in pursuing in uni. but after these papers, i dont think that's really within my grasp anymore. never in my life have I felt this unsure and unprepared for a national exam, so I really have no idea what to expect.

With the spread of the Coronavirus, many people have been wearing surgical/N95 masks and buying them in bulk.

However, the government and other sources have been stating that masks should only be worn by those who are sick as they are not made to prevent people from catching the coronavirus. Some have even said that it provides a false sense of security. This does not stop many Singaporeans who still wear masks everyday and everywhere, saying it is better to be safe.

21,cr3tpt,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378515,harder2breathe,False,public,,"Dear Singaporeans, advice needed- Also best and most affordable places to seek help?","There's a matter that has been disturbing me quite recently. I am a fresh grad and ironically, only just came to this ""realization"" that I may have way below average learning abilities- or even some kind of ADD that was never addressed. After reflecting on my life and considering the following points, I think it could be valid?

* The struggle with grasping mathematical and science concepts since primary school (In short, grasping logical concepts I guess?). For e.g., I don't understand why my friends around me can complete math and science worksheets given to them rightaway after a chapter is taught in class when I can‚Äôt do it rightaway. But I didn't thought much of that. Also, I remember my chinese teacher being puzzled about why I cannot memorising specific phrases within a short amount of time when others could although I was a ‚Äúhardworking‚Äù student. And many similar recurring examples. I had the same difficulties in accountancy/finance/econs mods in uni - I always knew mods like this would be difficult for me but I thought I could overcome them by hard work. I knew what the most effective methods to study, and how exam rubrics are like BUT I just couldn't do it. And I don‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt. Even after evaluating what needs to be improved in my own studying process or planning through how I can tackle exam questions, results were like crap. It is also very difficult for me to ‚Äòself-learn‚Äô concepts before tutorials because I needed very precise detailed solutions to questions in order to learn. Hence I couldn‚Äôt get anything done until tutorials answers were given although I tried very hard. It amazes me that some of my peers were able to do the worksheets after going through learning materials themselves and I was frustrated with professors calling those who couldn‚Äôt do the work lazy.
*  However, no one has ever flagged this to me perhaps because I work very hard to compensate and thus achieving results that are in the slightly below average to slightly above average range. But I felt like I always deserved better grades for the effort put in in my O levels, A levels, etc. (which I‚Äôve always thought due to my delusional + ineffective studying methods, but perhaps its more of not knowing that my learning methods should have been different?). 
* Great difficulties following step by step instructions verbally and through observation. When someone tells me instructions verbally, it is extremely difficult for me to follow or I easily miscomprehend/ find difficult to understand rational behind instructions given. I just find it difficult to pick up newly introduced routine tasks which most people probably can do in a shorter given time? (On the other hand, when given a task that requires much of my own discretion and flexibility such as designing an excel spreadsheet from scratch, I tend to do very well). On the point on having difficult following through observations- Sometimes, I ‚Äúhear‚Äù what someone says but my brain takes a few seconds to actually understand what they say and I can feel this from the POV of a third person when this happens. And when I look back at what just happened, I feel frustrated as to why I couldn‚Äôt process the words quickly. 
* Very poor observation learning skills and memory- When I take very long time to remember or perform routines newly introduced to me when everyone else could remember and do with ease rightaway. When I look at someone demonstrating say, a movement or even guitar technique, I knew what they were doing but I couldn‚Äôt replicate what they do no matter how hard I try. I can only do it if someone is there to physically guide me to the extent of having to help me move my limbs to the exact correct positions LOL. (Ok this is pretty similar to my point above)
* My mum complaining about having slow reaction to things in life and not being able to learn things well. My brother has also way below average learning abilities but his is a case that is way more severe, have had official mental health related diagnosis.
* Needing to go out often and getting bored extremely easily, hence having to be ‚Äúon the go‚Äù all the time or not I feel extremely restless. Colleagues at work also asked me why I like to take longer routes to walk to a certain venue when I could take a shortcut- But that‚Äôs because I want the time to fly, I rather walk than stand at a fixed place that kind of thing. Me discussing with others about having too many interests which is a double-edged sword? Always needing a change of environment very often.
*  The more I look back at my life the more I feel like perhaps something has been off the whole time but I just kept trying to overcome difficulties and blaming myself for all of these. On the other hand, I want to be as objectively as possible and avoid causing unnecessary paranoia to myself and eroding any of the self-confidence (I have left lol) so I think I will seek medical help soon even though many friends are saying that I‚Äôm overthinking (Which could be another possibility where I am too delusional to discern different things.)

~~[A BEAUTIFUL MIND - A joint exhibition by WELBART (PH) and JAYSON CORTEZ (PH)](https://i.imgur.com/wkKKS5G.jpg)~~

~~""Beautiful Mind"" is a refreshing revival of the positive and the optimistic. Grounded in the message that a beautiful mind is a positive mind, the exhibit sheds a light on how minds have the faculty to create, to think, and to control despite all hardships that may arise. It fosters a rare message that has often been overlooked in our current milieu that is much too focused on the negatives rather than the positives. In a world that is growing increasingly pessimistic, ""Beautiful Mind"" is a much needed reminder to see the good in everything.~~

Once Sister Sara leaves the room, the wigs come off, dentures fly, and walking frames become stage props and you‚Äôll know why they say age is only a (musical) number.

So I will be arriving in changi on the 21st at 10pm, and I will most likely stay at the airport overnight since my room won‚Äôt be ready until the 22nd. Couple of questions:

1. I heard that once I land I would need to go through immigration first, claim my luggage and then go through customs. But I heard that the rest area (sleeping chair/bed) is inside the terminal so once I claim my luggage and go through customs I won‚Äôt be able to go back in. Is this true?

2. I‚Äôm bringing 2 luggage (not exceeding 25kg each) and 1 carry on. In the luggage contains a shit ton of American snacks and 1liter of whiskey, couple of baby meds my friend requested, 5 pills of Xanax for anxiety, 1 strip of zzzquil and one bottle of my own meds, 1 small manchego cheese and 2 packs of small guanciale meat and one pack of cigs. Will this get me fined or worse, jail?

3.  Anything else I should know?

I will be arriving from the USA.

I am not that aware of the laws over there, but he is saying that he might lose his job if he was ever to be identified as HIV+ by his employers. Furthermore he has this notion that the support groups for these types of things are all full of 'gossips'. He is also not going to get his meds in Singapore for fear of getting tracked. So he opts for going all the way to Bangkok to do all his tests and get his meds. Which is obviously an expensive solution.

So is he on point here or is there a lot of paranoia and jumping to conclusions on his part?
