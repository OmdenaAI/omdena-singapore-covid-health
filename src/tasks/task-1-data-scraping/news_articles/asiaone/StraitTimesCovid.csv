Its Sym Academy offers therapy services for women and their families, and its Workspace Online programme provides live video calls with a therapist for employees in the same workplace.In addition, Ms Sun cited government resources available for Singaporeans under stress, such as the National Care Hotline, set up during the pandemic by the Ministry of Social and Family Development with the support of the Ministry of Health.Other government-supported helplines include those run by the Samaritans of Singapore and Institute of Mental Health.Ms Sun also touched on other needs of women.With studies showing the local prevalence of maternal depression at 7 per cent during pregnancy and 10 per cent three months after childbirth, it was important to raise awareness of the issue and look into how screening may be implemented to detect problems early.The Government has also enhanced leave schemes over the years to encourage men to play a greater role in childcare.",True

Shanmugam on Saturday (May 1).In Singapore, there are different facets to the issue, given the urban environment, the hectic lifestyle, as well as an ageing population.""It is something that all of us have to actively get involved in,"" said Mr Shanmugam, who joined the board members of charity Caregivers Alliance Limited (CAL) on a short walk at the Botanic Gardens with several canine companions.The walk is part of a larger campaign by CAL to raise awareness about mental health and the challenges faced by caregivers of people with mental health issues. It also aims to raise funds for CAL, which provides free training programmes for these caregivers.The donations will allow the charity to continue providing much needed support to caregivers and help to expand several new programmes, including courses for younger caregivers and caregivers of people with dementia.CAL's head of communications, Ms Tricia Lee, told The Straits Times: ""We have definitely seen an increase in the demand for the courses. Among our caregivers, more people have also been experiencing crises at home.""A survey of 1,000 people commissioned by ST in March found that one in three people felt his or her mental well-being had worsened since the eight-week circuit breaker period a year ago.Suicide prevention agency Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) received 39,492 suicide and crisis-related calls last year, an increase of 18 per cent from 33,387 in 2019.On the effect that the coronavirus has had on mental health, Mr Shanmugam said: ""People are social beings and when you can't socialise as much as you did (before), it does impact some people a little bit more.""More broadly, younger people here face daily stresses, whether in school or at work, he said. Meanwhile, older people are living longer and could face dementia-related issues.Mr Shanmugam added: ""Many of us will know people in our family, somebody (who) has a problem... I think as a society, we need to do more.""Launched on April 5, CAL's campaign, called Walk for Mental Wellness, ends on May 16, but donations are open until June 30.The campaign has already exceeded its $250,000 target, which will be matched dollar-for-dollar by the Government.Based on the idea of ""You Donate, They Walk"", mental wellness champions including Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin, MP Murali Pillai, former Nominated MP Anthea Ong and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital chief executive Chua Hong Choon, have been roped in for the campaign. They will need to walk or run 1km for every $100 raised, and have four weeks - between April 17 and May 16 - to complete their walk or run.Donors can track their champion's progress on the campaign's website.There is also a social media challenge. Members of the public can donate to CAL, walk 1km, and then nominate a friend to do the same by using the hashtag #W4MWChallenge.The campaign has raised $288,461 and clocked 2,884km so far.",True

Sometimes, my mouth will have a bitter taste too,"" she told The Straits Times.And she is not alone in her experience. Results from the 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study, released by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) on Friday (May 21), found that one in 43 of those aged 18 and up here has had a psychotic disorder in their lifetime.This translates to about 71,600 people.The study was conducted on 6,126 participants, representing the population, between 2016 and 2018 in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Nanyang Technological University. It was funded by MOH and Temasek FoundationIt is the first nationwide study to examine the prevalence of psychotic disorders in the Singapore resident population aged 18 years and above, the factors associated with such disorders and the treatment gap for the disorders.Psychotic disorders may involve one or more of the following:- Delusions, which are the fixed belief in something that is not true.- Hallucinations, which are sensations that are not real, such as seeing things that are not there.- Disorganised thoughts, making a person's speech difficult to follow with no logical connection.- Abnormal motor behaviour, which includes inappropriate or bizarre postures, or a complete lack of response to instructions.

The most common psychotic disorder in Singapore was schizophrenia, with about one in 116 - or 26,800 people - having been diagnosed with it at some point in their lives.This condition comes with a wide array of symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, disorganised behaviour, social withdrawal and attention impairment.The study found that the average age of onset of psychotic disorders here was 23.1 years, and that those with such conditions were 4.3 times more likely to be unemployed - although the researchers could not say for sure that this was directly caused by their condition.At least 80.4 per cent of those with such conditions had sought help for their symptoms.Professor Chong Siow Ann, senior consultant at the Research Division and Department of Psychosis at IMH and principal investigator of the study, said that while psychotic disorders are not as common as other mental health conditions, the extent of impairment and disabilities - including death - caused by psychotic disorders can be considerably greater.""The publication of this study is a timely reminder as we commemorate World Schizophrenia Day on May 24 that early detection and intervention can make a big difference in relieving the distress and suffering of the tens of thousands of people afflicted, and (who) will be afflicted, with these disorders,"" he added.For those living with a psychotic disorder, the experience can be very distressing.Marilyn (not her real name) was 20 years old when she began experiencing symptoms of schizoaffective disorder.Those with this condition have symptoms of schizophrenia as well as a mood disorder, such as depression or bipolar disorder.Now 30, the housewife told ST that her rush of thoughts used to keep her up for days.She said: ""My mind tried to link things that were not connected - it'd affect my thinking, so I couldn't speak properly, I couldn't have a proper conversation with my family.""When I watched TV, I'd think that it was talking about me and my family, and that could mean that something bad may happen to my family members. So I got very scared and worried, and my thoughts would run wild.""Ms Lai, who is currently unemployed, and started manifesting symptoms of a psychotic disorder around the age of 18, had similar experiences in the past.She said: ""I thought that people were looking at me from the HDB block opposite, and when I went out I thought that people were pointing at me.""I wanted to dash across the road - the voices (in my head) were saying that the cars would not hit me, and I was running away from something.""The lack of understanding of mental health conditions made it even harder to cope, said Ms Lai.""When I was having symptoms of depression, I didn't know what was going on. People thought I had an attitude problem… some teachers even said I was wasting space in the school,"" she said, adding that she did not even know she had a mental health condition at that time.Dr Charmaine Tang, chief of the Department of Psychosis at IMH, said early intervention is key to helping those with psychotic disorders cope with their conditions.""While schizophrenia and psychotic disorders are serious and chronic conditions, medications and psychosocial therapy can help people manage these conditions, recover and lead normal, fulfilling lives,"" she said.She added that when a person is more stable, individual and family therapy, social skills training, vocational rehabilitation and supported employment, as well as the support of family and friends, play a big role too.Ms Lai now takes a monthly injection to manage her symptoms, and has been largely symptom-free for the last three to four years apart from periodic bouts of depression, which she is able to manage on her own.Up till recently she worked in the special needs sector and as a peer support specialist, drawing on her own experiences to support those with mental health conditions.Marilyn experienced a total of three psychotic breaks from 2010 till now, and was admitted to IMH for a short period of time on each occasion.But with the help of medical support, she has managed to lead a relatively normal life, working as an accountant for seven years, getting married in 2017, and recently becoming a mother to a one-year-old child.Ms Lai said it has been heartening to see a general increase in mental health awareness in Singapore in recent years.However, both she and Marilyn noted that there are still misconceptions surrounding psychotic disorders.Ms Lai said that people tend to think someone with schizoaffective disorder has multiple personalities - which is incorrect - or is dangerous.""From my experience, people with this condition are more likely to be harmed than harm people,"" she said, adding that she hopes to see greater efforts in mental health education and more opportunities for people with mental health issues to integrate into society.Such harm may take the form of discrimination when applying for jobs or to schools, leading them to miss out on opportunities in life.This in turn perpetuates stigma about those with mental health conditions, said Ms Lai.Marilyn said: ""A lot of times, people think that those with this condition cannot be cured, and it's the end for them. They also think it means they have to stay in hospital on a long-term basis.""But she added that her experience shows this is not the case.She said: ""We can lead a normal life as well with proper medication and intervention.""Stigma against those with mental health conditions still exists in Singapore. I hope that people here can learn more about these conditions and reduce this stigma, because we are able to lead normal lives - we're not crazy people.""",True

72 minutes, showing exclusively at The Projector, 4 starsIn Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, half a million dogs and cats roam the streets. There is a rich vein of lore explaining why this ancient metropolis is so stray-friendly and this documentary touches on some of it in title cards.Those terse lines are about all the exposition you will get because the hook here is that viewers see the world through the eyes of its three furry protagonists, known in the film as Zeytin, Nazar and Kartal.Hong Kong film-maker Elizabeth Lo filmed this exercise in immersiveness between 2017 and 2019, with her handheld camera positioned a metre off the ground - at a dog's eye level. She follows the animals from beach and park to construction site and busy shopping district, often in the company of the glue-sniffing Syrian refugee boys who, like the animals they clearly love, are homeless.This film, winner of the Best International Documentary at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival 2020, is a natural bookend to Kedi (2016), director Ceyda Torun's study of Istanbul's street cats.But where Kedi was warm and human-centred, in Stray, Lo centres the dogs as creatures who live with humans but who also have their own communities.

She later withdrew from the tournament.On the eve of the French Open, Ms Osaka had likened post-match media inquests to ""kicking people when they are down"", which had a detrimental effect on her mental health"".She also came clean about suffering from bouts of depression since the US Open in 2018, admitting that she had ""a really hard time coping with that"".The International Tennis Federation has promised a comprehensive review on how players and media interact during tournaments, saying it takes mental health issues extremely seriously, Reuters reported on Saturday.Affirming that Ms Osaka had done the right thing, Madam Halimah said her move had ""sent a strong signal"" to millions around the world who are struggling with mental health issues, as it showed that ""it's okay to walk away from a toxic and stressful environment, even if that will set you back for a while"".She added that many people wait too long to protect their mental health, much to their detriment and that of their families, and many still continue to fear the stigma of being ""condemned"" for losing their mental faculties.Acknowledging that mental health has yet again become a hot topic due to social exclusion, lockdowns and safe management measures amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Madam Halimah said most people have developed ""mental resilience to overcome temporary setbacks"".However, developing that resilience starts from a young age, both at home and in school, she added.""It's sad when we read of young children killing themselves due to poor exam results because they saw their self-worth as linked to their school performance, and nothing else. We need constructive, uplifting conversations at home, school and the workplace.""Amid this difficult period, she added, women working from home often bear the brunt of mental stress, as they have to deal with caregiving responsibilities at the same time.Regardless of the situation, Madam Halimah said that a lot more empathy, care and kindness can be shown to those in our family and others in the community.""Always start with ourselves.

(This is) a good opportunity for social-health integration,"" said Mr Masagos.The Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes (Gusto) study has also found that one in five pregnant women is at risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).Gusto is a longitudinal study that started here in 2009 to study how pregnancy and early childhood conditions influence the health and development of women and their children.Diabetes in pregnancy, also known as gestational diabetes mellitus, is a condition of abnormal or elevated glucose readings during pregnancy.Mothers and their children are then at higher risk of metabolic disorders, and children are at a higher risk of developing obesity.Taking this into account, KKH initiated the Temasek Foundation GDM Care Programme to provide enhanced care for mothers with GDM, said Mr Masagos.""But we should not only see this as a medical issue. This is an area where it takes a whole-of-society effort,"" he added.Healthcare and social agencies can work alongside community organisations to develop programmes to address the risk factors for GDM, such as through physical activities and encouraging a nutritious diet.The Gusto study also found that found that maternal depression during pregnancy affects the development of brain microstructure in the foetus, which could lead to anxiety and mood disorders in the child's later life.Hence it is important to strengthen social support to mothers and mothers-to-be, and everyone can play a part, said Mr Masagos.For example, healthcare workers actively look out for symptoms of low mood and depression during antenatal and post-natal check-ups through screenings for mothers and mothers-to-be, while social agencies and community groups can also look out for such symptoms.At the workplace, more psychological and emotional support can be given to employees and colleagues who are pregnant or transiting back to work after maternity leave, such as through more flexible work arrangements.""At home and in the community, we can lend our support to our spouse, friends, relatives and neighbours who are pregnant and may be experiencing psycho-emotional stress,"" said Mr Masagos.He also gave an update on the inter-agency task force that aims to boost maternal health and kids' well-being here. The formation of the task-force was announced during the debate on the Health Ministry's budget earlier this year.The task force is developing a five-year strategy to provide comprehensive support to women and their children, starting as early as pre-conception and extending until the child turns 18.Mr Masagos gave a breakdown of the task force's plans.First, the task force will translate evidence-based findings into policies and programmes to address upstream risk factors. These include reviewing upstream preventive health efforts for women and children or exploring how to better prepare and equip young couples for parenthood.Second, the Government and the agencies involved are reviewing their service delivery processes and will look at how healthcare agencies can strengthen collaboration with the social service and education sector organisations.Third, the task force will use public education to boost awareness and engagement in order to shape positive behaviours.Said Mr Masagos: "" If we want to give (children) the best start in life, our support must also extend to the mother... It makes good sense for our entire society to be invested into this cause, because it benefits everyone.""",True

""You break it down, it's really about whether we are all motivated to achieve a common purpose,"" she said.Noting that AfAs are still in their nascent stage, she added: So they are also learning by doing and getting to know each other.""On how AfAs are different from ground-up initiatives, Dr Koh said having the Government in the mix allows people to get answers faster. ""Previously, citizens will say, wait, do you think the Government will allow this, or do you think we need a licence?""""Having everybody in the mix, including a government representative, in addition to all the citizens... it's much faster that way, rather than: 'We are all very far away from each other, you're across the wall and I have to shout and I don't know if I'll just be a voice in the wilderness,"" she added.Such alliances function as sandboxes of sorts, where people interested in creating change or doing something completely new can have the space to do so, she said.Calling on people to take part, she said: ""No effort too small, just chip in... That's what the young people are saying: Get rid of compartments and silos and just try and see how we all fit together in different ways. So everybody is equal, but different, and that diversity should be harnessed.""Several readers also sent in questions on the AfAs and their topics.One asked how digitalisation could even be considered when some nonprofits are struggling with basic things like volunteer management and fund-raising.Ms Indranee said the Government has various schemes to help.""Once you are online, you have broadened your reach exponentially both for raising funds as well as for getting volunteers,"" she said, encouraging smaller groups to approach the relevant agencies. ""They will point you in the right direction, set up your AfAs, and then we'll be able to channel volunteers to you,"" she added.Other readers asked about better support for persons with autism as well as day activity centres for those with special needs.National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre chief executive Melissa Kwee said activities and jobs could be designed to be more inclusive and empower them.She gave the example of how instead of delivering food to seniors at home, one group invited them down to take part in preparing, cooking and serving food.""It created a community, you had seniors helping seniors, it reduced isolation,"" Ms Kwee added.A reader asked about speeding up change from people who are good at maintaining systems to people good at creating ideas.Ms Indranee said there is a need for a national system, but also for a flexibility that allows for nimbleness and responsiveness.

After three months, parents reported a 20 per cent reduction in their children's scores for problematic behaviour, as well as their own parenting stress scores.Parents can sign up for the programme by contacting the Parenting Support Providers serving their child’s school or region, or approach the child’s school teacher-in-charge of parenting programmes.He added that more than 1,500 individuals - including young people, parents and mental health professionals - also came together to start the Youth Mental Well-Being Network last year. This network is supported by the Ministry for Social and Family Development, as well as the Health and Education ministries.""We have parents coming back to tell us that they now have greater parenting competence,"" he added.Ms Tan then asked if there are plans to take such programmes offline and into the real world, especially for parents who may not ""naturally gravitate"" towards finding information online.Online platforms are being heavily used at present given the ongoing pandemic, Mr Chua replied, but added that his ministry will nevertheless work with community partners as much as possible.",True

They also spoke on the need to reduce the stigma surrounding speaking up about mental health.Ms Sun said: ""We are placing a lot of emphasis on teaching students the telltale signs that their mental health is at risk... very importantly, we are trying to normalise these conversations in schools.""TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, is popular among young people worldwide.However, mental health content on the app has been characterised as oversimplifying complex issues in mental health.In January, The New York Times (NYT) reported that therapists like licensed professional counsellor and former southern region chairman at the American Counselling Association Lisa Henderson were concerned that on TikTok, where videos are necessarily short, mental health treatments can be presented easy fixes.""It can be misleading more so than intentionally harmful,"" she told NYT.Despite this, students here said that the programme is both welcome and important.SMU economics undergraduate and regular TikTok user Chng Lu Yee, 21, said: ""I think this is a good idea because you can find both extremes of positive and negative content on TikTok.  ""It is very influential especially among people slightly younger than me, whatever is trending on the app has a real influence which you can see in things like clothes and how people speak,"" she added.The Youth for Good programme will be run with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, the MOE and the National Youth Council.",True

A third initiative under the AfA will focus on facilitating the distribution of donations in kind through a platform to match the demand and supply of donated items such as masks, sanitisers, computers and mobile phones.Mr Tan also announced a separate AfA that will work towards creating a national blueprint and framework on corporate purpose.Among other things, it will encourage businesses to incorporate a given social, environmental or other cause into their business strategy and operations, and provide them with a way to measure their impact and track their progress.Mr Tan told Parliament a study is under way on identifying the enablers and corporate intermediaries as well as uncovering the challenges to doing good.The preliminary findings are expected by May this year, and the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre will then design and develop the blueprint with interested organisations.Correction note: This article has been edited for accuracy.",True

The hybrid event was held at the Trade Association Hub in Jurong and streamed online.""Workers must take time to take care not just of their physical health, but also of their mental well-being,"" he added.The annual campaign, organised by the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council, entails year-long outreach efforts to promote safety and health in workplaces.On mental well-being, a new campaign in September will see healthcare institutions and agencies share best practices to build workers' mental resilience.About one in three people in Singapore feels his mental well-being has worsened since the circuit breaker kicked in a year ago, a poll commissioned by The Straits Times showed.The poll of 1,000 people, conducted by online market research firm Milieu Insight from March 25 to March 29 this year, found that 31 per cent reported that their mental well-being had “somewhat worsened”. Five per cent said it had worsened “much more”.The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will continue to assist firms in developing such support at their workplaces, said Mr Zaqy. The WSH council will also be developing training workshops and an online resource page on mental health matters.In addition, a tripartite award on mental well-being will be introduced next year to recognise individuals and companies that have adopted exemplary practices.This year, employers and workers are also called to take a pause from work to care for their safety and health. This can be a scheduled break of 30 minutes or more, where workers can do stretching exercises, perform safety checks or identify hazards around them.WSH Council chairman John Ng said: ""When conducted regularly, these actions become habitual and can improve the worker's health and heighten his awareness of unsafe acts or conditions in his work environment in the long run.""Two other campaigns for workplace safety will run throughout the year to address the top two contributors to non-fatal workplace injuries in recent years.One, targeting high-risk sectors, will be launched in June to address slips, trips and falls. Employers and workers will pick up best practices and set goals to reduce incidents.A Safe Hands Campaign is also planned for March next year, where companies will be encouraged to take steps to prevent machinery incidents.On Thursday, Mr Zaqy called on employers to send workers for regular training, assess risks and carry out periodic checks on equipment and procedures. Fostering a ""no-blame culture"" will also encourage workers to speak up when they see anything amiss, he pointed out.

He also urged workers to report unsafe conditions and near-misses to their supervisors.Mr Zaqy said machinery safety, as well as slips, trips and falls were two ""hot spots"" that accounted for nearly half of all major injuries last year.Citing an inspection on a manufacturing firm last week where MOM officers uncovered several lapses, including the poor maintenance of machinery, Mr Zaqy said such safety lapses can lead to serious injuries or fatalities. His ministry has also observed an emerging issue of more untrained personnel operating machinery.For slip, trip and fall incidents, six out of 10 of those injured were cleaners and labourers, he highlighted.One in five of those injured slipped, tripped or fell as they were walking, according to a survey of the 26,000 such workplace incidents between 2012 and 2019. The most common location where these accidents happened were at stairs or steps.Mandatory workplace safety and health training will be rolled out in stages for selected sectors. For instance, all cleaners will undergo such training from next year to reduce the risk of slips, trips and falls.WSH Council's Mr Ng said: ""Although Singapore has gradually resumed most of its business activities and safe management measures may have been relaxed, we must continue to do our utmost to ensure that no one gets hurt at work.""",True

SOS said the campaign is remind young people to think about their intention and how best to communicate before they post, as well as to improve their awareness of the appropriate language to use.It is also developing a curriculum and plans to train 300 young people to look out for their own mental health and safely engage young people online.Temasek Foundation has pledged $250,000 for the training curriculum, which will be implemented later this year.SOS and the foundation plan to offer one-hour virtual forum sessions and work with educational institutions such as secondary schools, junior colleges and polytechnics to offer 2½-hour workshops.The initiative comes after SOS recorded more than 4,600 texts sent to its text messaging service Care Text between last July, when it was launched, and March this year. Of those, 82 per cent were from individuals aged 10 to 29. And about 70 per cent of them had not used other SOS services before.Suicide is the leading cause of death in Singapore for those aged 10 to 29. In 2019, there were 400 suicides reported - of which nearly a quarter or 94 were young people in that age group.SOS chief executive Gasper Tan said: ""Encouraging a 'pause' to think before you speak is the first step in learning how to discuss suicide safely and reminds people to reflect about the consequences of their words before acting.""It is even more pertinent now, especially as we live in a hyper-connected world where speed and efficiency are of the essence, and we often find ourselves rushing to respond or comment to posts.""Everyone has a proactive part to play in suicide prevention. We hope that #chatsafe can be part of the solution and form an important part of upstream education on suicide situations, empowering youths to create positive behaviour and mindset change when talking about suicide online.""The #PauseBeforeYouPost campaign is based on a similar social media campaign held in Australia in 2018. Guidelines for the Australian campaign - first developed by Australian charity Orygen - have been downloaded about 50,000 times since publication.The Singaporean version of the guidelines was updated to include local helpline information and specific social media content for Singaporean users.Noting that social media was an important platform for young people to receive and offer help, Orygen's head of suicide prevention Jo Robinson said: ""We also recognise that there is the potential for some kinds of suicide-related content to be distressing or even harmful to others.

Prominent public figures like DBS Group chief executive Piyush Gupta have also spoken openly about their mental health struggles in socially conservative Singapore, reducing the stigma surrounding the topic.The National Care Hotline, which was set up in April last year to provide psychological first aid and emotional support during Covid-19, was one example of the historic scale of these efforts, says mental health professional Andrea Chan.""For so long in the history of Singapore, we never had this. It was as if the nation came together to say, 'We embrace mental health', and that came about as a result of Covid-19,"" adds the assistant director of Touch Mental Wellness, a division of Touch Community Services, which provides mental health services and education.She says: ""There has been a normalisation of mental health struggles. In the past, people with such challenges may have been viewed as weak, but with Covid-19, everyone experienced vulnerability to stress and disruption to some degree.""Such symptoms could include feelings of fear or uncertainty, or a sense of being overwhelmed by Covid-19 restrictions, such as when the entire family was working and learning from home.Ms Chan adds that there seems to be greater acceptance towards seeking help and talking about mental health, especially in mass media.The National Care Hotline has managed more than 40,000 calls since it started operations a year ago, the latest figures provided by the Ministry of Social and Family Development showed.Other initiatives include the Covid-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce, which was announced in October last year. The inter-agency task force was convened by the Government to provide a coordinated national response to the mental health needs of Singaporeans arising from the pandemic.In November, Economic Development Board managing director Chng Kai Fong opened up about his mental and emotional state, a rare occurrence among Singapore's top public servants.He spoke about the ""signs of depressive bouts"" he experienced during the pandemic, when facing crises like the death of his brother-in-law. One day, he did not even want to get out of bed, he said.Shortly after, Mr Gupta shared how he went through a period of ""acute anxiety"" when his start-up failed in 2000.""I also learnt that people are often wary of talking about this because of a presumed stigma. However, the more open you are, the easier it becomes to deal with the issue,"" the top banker said.Last year, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) received about 10,000 outpatient referrals, a 3 per cent increase over the year before, according to figures it provided.Dr Jared Ng, senior consultant in IMH's emergency services, says there is now a greater hunger on the part of the public and employers to learn more about mental health, through avenues like webinars.Observers say mental health awareness had already been growing in recent years, but the pandemic made it difficult to ignore symptoms that were previously swept under the carpet.In 2018, the National Council of Social Service launched the Beyond The Label movement to encourage the public to look beyond a mental health diagnosis and accept people with mental health conditions for who they are.Mr Jonathan Siew, principal counsellor at Care Corner Counselling Centre, saw marital conflicts spike in the enforced proximity of the stay-home period.The stress and social isolation of Covid-19 also placed a mental burden across almost all demographics, including teens, parents and seniors.The silver lining has been the unexpected success of online counselling, he says.Mr Siew adds: ""The idea of doing online counselling was not possible before, as it was felt that counselling had to be in person.""When push came to shove, however, we found that online counselling was efficient and opened us up to new groups of clients.""Telecounselling via Zoom helped him support some young adults working from home. They were experiencing tensions with family members, whom they used to spend long hours away from while at work.Mr Siew is also looking into how Zoom therapy can benefit people with depression, who may not want to venture out or travel for a counselling session.Some mental health service providers have already charted new plans for a post-Covid-19 future.In January, Touch Mental Wellness launched an intervention service that helps primary school pupils build resilience.Ms Chan says: ""Even if there's no longer Covid-19, the children will have the resources to deal with stressors in a very uncertain world.""• National Care Hotline: 1800-202-6868• Institute of Mental Health's Mental Health Helpline: 6389-2222• Touchline: 1800-377-2252• Care Corner Counselling Centre: 6353-1180",True

By Linda Collins
Math Paper Press/ Hardcover/ 154 pages/ $26.75/ Available here Writer Linda Collins came to poetry after the death of her daughter.Collins, 62, a Straits Times copy editor who has worked in the newspaper industry for most of her life, is well-versed in the formula of news writing, of constructing logical narratives out of hard facts.But after her 17-year-old daughter Victoria McLeod committed suicide in 2014, she realised she needed new structures of language to grieve.""Have you ever loved the dead?"" she writes in the poem Grief Love. ""Then you'll know it involves a sign language for the death of reason.""This phrase became the title of her debut poetry collection, which was edited by Singaporean poet Tania De Rozario.""Poetry's got its own language that conversation or normal verbal speech doesn't capture,"" Collins says over Zoom from New Zealand, where she was born. ""It's irrational sometimes. There's no rhyme or reason to it.""An event like the death of a child, she adds, ""changes you right to the cellular level"".This is something she thinks many are going through during the Covid-19 pandemic.""It makes you realise you're not really in control of your life, that there are things at another level that throw that out. I hope that title encompasses that feeling as well.""Collins moved to Singapore in 1993 with ST deputy picture editor Malcolm McLeod, now her husband. Their only child, Victoria, was born and grew up here.In 2019, Collins wrote Loss Adjustment, a memoir about her daughter's death. It draws on Victoria's journal entries, which Collins found posthumously.Collins, who is now pursuing a creative writing master's degree at the University of East Anglia in Britain, has continued to write about teenage suicide. She contributed a chapter to an upcoming non-fiction book, Katie's Diaries Updated, edited by pre-eminent psychologist David Lester.Both she and Victoria had poems come out earlier this year in Canadian anthology Voicing Suicide, a rare instance of a mother and her late daughter being published in the same anthology.For the longest time, she tried to write away from Loss Adjustment and her daughter's suicide, until her mentor, American poet Michael Montlack, told her: ""Linda, you got to put the kid in the book.""Victoria is now present in the collection, from The Grief-Box, a poem on cremation in the two-column style of twin cinema, to a found poem composed of the titles of Nancy Drew detective stories found in her bookcase.Still, Collins wanted to subvert the tropes attached to the grieving mother. In one poem, she writes about sexual desire and slyly quotes rapper Lizzo.""The 'I' in the poem is a slippery 'I'. It can be used in many ways. It doesn't necessarily represent the writer at all. I was kind of shocked that people didn't realise that.""I want to stick them in situations that some might find awkward and uncomfortable, like for example sexual yearning. A grieving mum is meant to be asexual. I just wanted to be a bit playful with that.""If I make people have a laugh or become aghast or feel some sort of emotion - well, this is what poetry does. It reaches, sometimes, places that other genres can't.""Letter To My Mother

This includes mindline.sg, an online portal with mental health resources that can also assess users' emotional well-being.Madam Halimah said the Republic adopts a whole-of-society approach in building a safety net for those living with mental health conditions.It includes training schools and social service agencies to identify and manage at-risk children with severe emotional and behavioural problems, offering free mental health checks as well as rolling out coordinated mental health and social support services for at-risk youngsters.However, many with mental health conditions do not seek treatment in a timely manner, noted Madam Halimah.The 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study found that more than three-quarters of those living with mental health conditions did not seek treatment.""The delay in treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder was 11 years; four years for bipolar disorder and alcohol abuse; and two years for anxiety disorder,"" she said.Various studies have shown that social stigma and a lack of knowledge about mental disorders are two common reasons for treatment delay.Madam Halimah said: ""Mental health conditions that are left untreated will impair children's development, and undermine their ability to achieve their fullest potential.""It is therefore important that we step up efforts to protect the mental health of our children early.""The virtual congress will run till Friday, with discussions on the importance of early intervention in the child and adolescent stages for better mental health over a lifetime.",True

They bring the total of such partnerships to date to 18.The new AfAs are part of the latest effort by nationwide volunteerism movement SG Cares to promote partnerships between the people and the private and public sectors.One example is a tie-up between the Loving Heart Multi-Service Centre, a volunteer centre based in the Yuhua constituency, and ground-up group Bold At Work.As part of the AfA on Emerging Needs and Volunteerism, the organisations are working together on programmes and activities to promote mental wellness among Yuhua residents, while providing the volunteer facilitators with skills training and experience in social care.In one such activity, known as a ""pop-up conversation bar"", volunteers will prompt participants to talk about their perspectives or recent life experiences, such as difficulties they faced in adapting to life amid a pandemic.Instead of using cash, the participants can ""pay"" for their drinks and snacks at the bar by sharing their stories.About 15 volunteers will undergo training by next month, with the Loving Heart Multi-Service Centre looking to eventually train about 50 volunteers and 500 residents of the Yuhua community in total.Another partnership under the AfA comprises CapitaLand's philanthropic arm CapitaLand Hope Foundation; RSVP Singapore, an organisation for senior volunteers; and Singapore Pools.The organisations will establish a learning centre in Chinatown to help seniors learn about digital technology and how to integrate it in their daily lives.The centre, which is funded by CapitaLand Hope Foundation and Singapore Pools, will allow seniors to familiarise themselves with tools such as facial recognition systems, digital payment platforms and smart home appliances.Singapore Pools and CapitaLand will also work together to curate the programmes and send their staff to run the programmes as part of their corporate volunteerism efforts.Seniors will also be encouraged to volunteer to help develop the programmes, or to be guides and coaches at the centre.A third initiative under the AfA will focus on facilitating the distribution of donations in kind through a platform to match demand and supply of donated items such as masks, sanitisers, computers and mobile phones.Mr Tan also announced a separate AfA that will work towards creating a national blueprint and framework on corporate purpose.Among other things, it will encourage businesses to incorporate a social or environmental cause, for instance, into their business strategy and operations, and provide them with a way to measure their impact and track their progress.Mr Tan told Parliament a study is under way on identifying the enablers and corporate intermediaries, as well as uncovering the challenges to doing good.The preliminary findings are expected by May, and the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre will then design and develop the blueprint with interested organisations.Correction note: This article has been edited for accuracy.",True

I served in the navy for 12 years and was the first female commanding officer,” she said.She also said there have been ""procedural errors"" on the part of the investigating officers, alleging that she was arrested without a warrant.Phoon also asked that she be offered bail of $3,000 without a surety, as she was the navy's first female commanding officer and has made contributions to Singapore ""as a pioneer"".The prosecution had asked for bail to be set at $10,000, with conditions that she complies with current Covid-19 regulations and does not reoffend while out on bail.The court was told that Phoon may face further charges.Phoon told the court that her family members in Singapore were either ill or elderly and that most of her friends were overseas.She also asked for clarification on what the Covid-19 regulations were.District Judge Janet Wang said these were laws everyone else was abiding by, including the wearing of a mask in public spaces.Phoon was previously on trial for a charge under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act: for failing to wear a mask over her nose and mouth “at all times” at Newton hawker centre, between 7.20pm and 8pm on May 8, 2020.She had turned up for a hearing on that charge on May 24 and was seen removing her mask after leaving the State Courts building that day.She was arrested the next day and slapped with five more charges under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act and one charge under the Infectious Diseases Act.One of the charges relates to an incident on May 15, when Phoon was caught on video refusing to wear a mask at MBS after been told to do so by a safe distancing ambassador. She was seen questioning the safe distancing ambassador on whether she had a badge and asking who she represented.The charge under the Infectious Diseases Act is for loitering at various places in MBS while under stay-home notice in June last year.

He said this would reduce the amount of money that households here feel they must spend on private tuition, which he described as an ""implicit tax"" on Singaporean families.Smaller class sizes can also help level the playing field for lower-income students, he added.ERIC CHUA (TANJONG PAGAR GRC)Mr Chua asked how Singapore could change its mindset of defining success in terms of academic achievements, and drop its deep-seated biases against those who are less academically inclined.""It is high time that we recognise that every youth has potential and potential should not be defined narrowly in terms of academic achievement,"" he said.He also asked how the country could structure an education system that will nurture, mentor and help such students uncover and pursue their passions.RAHAYU MAHZAM (JURONG GRC)Ms Rahayu said Singapore has to start seeing special needs students as assets to the community with untapped talents, in order to draw out their potential. She cited how people diagnosed with autism-spectrum disorder are being trained for cyber security jobs as they are well-suited to data annotation.She asked if the Education Ministry could look into developing skill sets to help special needs students find gainful employment, and what could be done to train teachers to support such students.CARRIE TAN (NEE SOON GRC)Ms Tan brought up the increasing rate of teen suicide in recent years and asked the Minister of Education about the current strategies to strengthen mental health support in schools.She also wanted to know how teachers and staff were being equipped to deal with mental health issues that stem from poverty, peer victimisation, family violence, racism, homophobia and transphobia. ""When society risks losing young lives to mental health struggles, educators need to understand,"" she said.NOMINATED MP SHAHIRA ABDULLAHDr Shahira asked if all teachers could be trained to facilitate discussions on controversial issues, noting that such training is currently offered to some.""Controversial issues and incidents can happen at any time and it would be advantageous for all teachers to be able to seize it as a teachable moment when it happens,"" she said.She noted that constructive guided discussions in school may be an effective way of unpacking such issues, given that many youth may pick up their opinions and knowledge on them from the Internet.MARIAM JAAFAR (SEMBAWANG GRC)The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in schools cancelling overseas learning trips and exchange programmes, said Ms Mariam.She noted that overseas work experience has many benefits, including gaining a sense of perspective and enhancing adaptability.She asked if the Government can tap the global firms that it partners for skills programmes - to provide opportunities for students and trainees here to gain exposure and experience working on projects with teams outside Singapore amid the pandemic.LEON PERERA (ALJUNIED GRC)There is a growing recognition that soft skills are crucial for 21st century employees, said Mr Perera, adding that results for Pisa 2018 (Programme for International Student Assessment) indicated two areas of concern for students in Singapore - adaptability to new challenges and the fear of failure.He called for the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum to plug these gaps, such as through cultivating a form of standardised measurement of soft skills.LOUIS NG (NEE SOON GRC)Mr Ng asked if the Education Ministry would strengthen the processes for teachers to seek feedback on their performance.""We all grow and learn from feedback. Teachers are no different. School leaders must give teachers who receive a C-or D grade feedback to improve their performance,"" said Mr Ng.Some teachers, he noted, had shared that feedback comes only after the grade is issued, with little done to help them improve in the course of the school year.",True

Separated from her father and sister, the girl was struggling, trying to cope with her parents' divorce and her upcoming exams.Dr Thio said: ""One night she called me and said 'everything is better' and that she wanted to treat me to breakfast the next morning. She seemed so happy when we had that breakfast.""Unfortunately, that was the last time I would see her. The reason she felt better that morning was because she had decided to end her life.""The traumatic episode led Dr Thio to devote over 30 years to improving the lives of persons with mental health issues, culminating in her setting up local charity Caring for Life (CFL) in April last year.The charity, which aims to establish a community approach to suicide prevention, was founded by Dr Thio and philanthropists Keith Chua and Hsieh Fu Hua.Since August last year, it has trained more than 300 participants from different organisations through a customised programme, which teaches participants to recognise signs of suicidal ideation at the workplace, school or within the home.The programme is called LIFE - an acronym for Listen, Inquire directly, Find lifelines, and Engage professional help.Through it, participants learn to recognise signs, engage individuals with suicidal ideation, and connect them with community resources for suicide intervention.It also stresses safety in engaging conversations that foster open talk to address suicide.Mr Chua, who serves as the board chairman of the charity, said: ""The intention of CFL is not to duplicate the existing services in this area. Where we fit in is in the early intervention and prevention category, where a lot more can be done.""Because of stigma, many people with mental health issues are not seeking professional help. We hope CFL's programme will help the community gain a better understanding and also enable those who are not yet seeking proper help to do so in time.""Dr Thio, who serves as CFL's executive director, sought to develop the LIFE programme's curriculum with a strong emphasis on community effort.She said: ""We tend to do better with a strong social network of friends and family. As such, I am led to believe that suicide prevention efforts must involve the community, especially the loved ones and close friends of the individuals at-risk of suicide.""CFL has collaborated with organisations such as the Institute of Mental Health, Samaritans of Singapore and ground-up movement SGFamilies.Ms Carol Loi, co-founder of SGFamilies, said she participated in the programme to support those struggling with suicidal ideation as well as their next-of-kin.""The programme helped me better understand how to broach the difficult topic of suicide and recognise that bringing the issue out in the open is helpful,"" she said.Despite the progress she has witnessed and initiated in Singapore's mental health sector over the years, Dr Thio still remembers that young girl who ended her life years ago and asks herself the same questions:""The questions from back then still ring in my ears today. What else could I have done? What did I miss? What now?""If there is one thing I can take from that incident, it is this: I should have Listened and Inquired more, Found a Lifeline and Engaged a Professional's Help.""Readers can find out more information about CFL and the LIFE programme at this website.Samaritans Of Singapore: 1800-221-4444Singapore Association For Mental Health: 1800-283-7019Institute Of Mental Health's Mobile Crisis Service: 6389-2222Care Corner Counselling Centre (Mandarin): 1800-353-5800Silver Ribbon: 6386-1928Tinkle Friend: 1800-274-4788",True

Second, it will develop a national mental health resources webpage to help individuals access useful and accurate information.Third, it will establish a national mental health competency training framework to align and standardise training curricula on mental health in the community.Task force chairman Chua Hong Choon told The Straits Times on Friday that the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) will lead the development of this framework.Its work will include coming up with a national mental health curriculum for the management of mental health issues among front-line workers, and more training to bridge the knowledge gap on mental health among general practitioners.He added that while the pandemic negatively impacted the well-being of those here in many ways, it also produced three positive outcomes.First, multiple agencies are now coming together with renewed impetus to support people who experience mental health distress.Second, there is greater awareness that mental health issues are not uncommon as more people come forward to share their experiences publicly.""This helps to de-stigmatise mental health conditions, and encourage more people to self-care and seek help from the community,"" said Professor Chua.Third, there is also a strong commitment at the government level to invest resources to further strengthen mental health resilience in the population.""There is a saying within the task force that as we vaccinate ourselves against the Covid-19 virus, building resilience is our 'vaccine' against mental health issues,"" said Prof Chua.The task force is to be transformed by the middle of this year, and more details will be shared when ready.Dr Janil said in Parliament that Singapore is on track to meet its end-of-year targets for the Community Mental Health Masterplan, which was launched in 2012 and enhanced in 2017.In 2017, then Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor had said that Singapore would set up 50 community outreach teams and 18 community intervention teams by the end of 2021.Dr Janil updated the House that 50 community outreach teams have already been set up and reached out to over 350,000 persons with mental health or dementia needs, while 21 community intervention teams have been established to provide mental health interventions such as psycho-social therapeutic interventions and counselling; ahead of the previous timeline.Singapore also now has over 220 general practitioners and 14 polyclinics that can provide patients with either mental health or dementia services, or both.Speaking in the same debate, Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam added that in August last year, the ""Brave the New"" campaign was launched to build the psychological resilience of individuals.The campaign provided tips for self-care, and information to support their peers and loved ones, and reached 2.1 million Singaporeans.Ms Rahayu said that three-quarters of those surveyed reported being more motivated to help themselves or others in their mental wellbeing.In order to complement this, the ""Hi!JustCheckingIn"" movement kicked off in January this year to equip targeted segments of the population with the appropriate skills to help them identify and reach out to those who may need support.""Building a supportive community is important, to encourage Singaporeans to seek help if they are unable to cope,"" said Ms Rahayu.Dr Janil noted that refurbishment works at IMH, which began in 2018, are expected to be completed by the end of 2022.Upon completion, IMH will have a new short-stay unit to manage patients who need a few days of observation and treatment, six upgraded acute psychiatric wards with modular flexibility for more efficient care of patients, and two new rehabilitative wards mimicking a home environment to facilitate recovery.It will also have an upgraded child and adolescent psychiatry ward to provide inpatient psychiatric care for younger patients and an upgraded Addiction Medicine ward to facilitate recovery and rehabilitation of patients.Turning to the subject of youth mental health, Dr Janil noted that the Integrated Youth Service - a programme giving at-risk youth access to coordinated mental health and social support services - has been piloted in partnership with the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), IMH and community partner Care Corner.Since April last year, the latter has begun community outreach using online platforms, and has reached out to over 2,600 users online.Dr Janil added that MOH and AIC have also worked with other community partners to set up youth community outreach teams to reach out to young people in mental distress to provide basic emotional support and resources.Such teams also engage families to understand stressors the youth may be facing, as well as their situation at home, and help provide links to social and health services.There are teams that reach out to residents and their caregivers to provide information on mental health or dementia, basic emotional support, and link them to the appropriate health or social services where necessary.Seniors at risk of social isolation are connected to befrienders by the active ageing centres, the Silver Generation Office and local grassroots organisations.These befrienders will reach out to the seniors on a regular basis, provide companionship and encourage them to participate in social activities. Seniors can also sign up with CareLine, a 24/7 social support hotline that provides tele-befriending services as well as emergency response to seniors in distress.Ms Rahayu added that many seniors were mentally and physically affected during the pandemic, especially during the circuit breaker last year.She said that last year, the virtual ""Balik Kampung"" programme was trialled and linked 100 seniors with 22 senior activity centres for mentally stimulating activities.""With good feedback on how it has helped seniors stay socially connected, we will ramp up these efforts,"" she said.Dr Janil said: ""Our ability to get this far was the result of many years of investing in our people, facilities, systems, research and capabilities. We must learn the lessons from this experience. The preparations for the next crisis are under way and require that we keep ourselves and our healthcare system in good health. Prevention is best; preparation is also necessary.""",True

There are now more than 400 vets in Singapore and around 100 vet clinics.The sector has also seen an increase in specialist services such as internal medicine, traditional Chinese medicine for animals and post-operative rehabilitation.""With this growth and diversification of the sector, there is a need to clarify the scope of veterinary services and how they can be effectively delivered,"" said SVA and AVS, a cluster of the National Parks Board (NParks).Dr Cathy Chan, a vet who co-founded The Animal Doctors clinic, said the strain of sustaining a business, the fatigue caused by seeing animals in distress and the added stress of being harshly criticised online by pet owners have taken a toll on some vets.The 42-year-old added that mental health issues have caused some vets to leave the industry.""Vets don't want to speak up online because it's not a very professional thing to do. We always want to try and resolve things directly with the owner... You also have Facebook pages set up to basically slaughter a specific clinic,"" Dr Chan said, noting that some animal lovers have set up social media pages to target vets or clinics they have disagreements with.In a case last year, animal lovers sent a torrent of hateful comments to a vet clinic that euthanised a mongrel that had grown increasingly aggressive. This was after some netizens alleged that the couple who adopted the dog in 2017, and the vet, had put down the dog unnecessarily.After a four-month investigation, AVS concluded that the owners and vet had not breached the law and code of ethics.SVA currently offers a counselling service for vets and late last year launched a platform where vets can seek advice on work-related problems and stresses, said Dr Timothy Chua, 33, the association's president.Another gap the vets hope to address in the review is the role the Animals and Birds Act, and SVA's code of ethics, can play in clearly defining decisions and medical procedures that should be made and done by only vets.Vets note that pet owners are increasingly turning to unconventional services such as animal communicators and pet psychics.Dr Chan said that currently, a ""layperson can perform acts of veterinary science without any consequence, which can be quite detrimental to the animal"".Dr Kenneth Tong, 41, who runs AAVC-Animal & Avian Veterinary Clinic, said such services have a place in the pet sector, in terms of helping owners understand their pets and exploring options to help their sick animals feel better.

Civil servant Fiona Loh, 35, who is also a cat rescuer, said: ""I do engage my regular animal communicator in some rescue cases. I believe conventional and unconventional methods can work hand in hand.""But vets draw the line at treatment and diagnosis.Dr Chan, who is also SVA's vice-president, said if an owner, for instance, consults an animal communicator regarding a sick pet, and the animal says it does not want to see a vet, that might delay treatment.Vets also hope to see a register set up to recognise vets with specialist qualifications, so pet owners can identify the vets they need to see.After sending out a survey to vets and para-professionals, including vet nurses, last month, AVS and SVA will conduct discussions with the sector and wider community in the middle of the year to explore the issues raised.

For more than a decade now, vets in Singapore have been calling for the formation of a neutral professional board - much like the Singapore Medical Council and the Singapore Dental Council - in regulating the conduct and ethics of vets here.Currently, AVS regulates vets and assesses complaints regarding professional conduct.

In contrast, the study found that only about 15 per cent of articles highlighted care, prevention and recovery.The study had examined 2,000 local media articles from 2016 to 2019.In addition, the study found that stigmatising phrases such as ""mentally ill"" were used, especially in the headlines of articles.Ms Porsche Poh, executive director of Silver Ribbon (Singapore),  said: ""You don't say a person with skin problem or cancer was caught for attacking someone. If you don't mention a physical illness why mention a mental illness?""Silver Ribbon is a non-profit organisation dedicated to combating mental health stigma and helping those with mental health conditions integrate into society.She said positive reports on mental health may encourage people with such conditions to see that they can lead a productive life.In the book's foreword, editor-at-large of The Straits Times Han Fook Kwang said stories that stigmatise people result in readers no longer looking for the whys and hows behind an incident, as they have already formed their own stereotyped views.""I learnt much from this guide and wished it was available when I was in the newsroom. It pains me to think of the number of times we might have fallen short.""Looking back, I think we were largely ignorant and did not know our work could have such a stigmatising effect. This guide should help journalists do better,"" added Mr Han.",True

Addressing a hybrid event of 50 in-person attendees at Goodwood Park Hotel and some 300 online viewers, Professor Koh noted that one challenge facing Singapore was how to reconcile the imperative of development with that of sustainability and protecting the environment.Mr Lee acknowledged this and outlined the challenges in charting Singapore's land use as spanning the needs in housing, recreation, public health, active ageing, education and more.Hence the need for continued conversations with Singaporeans on balancing these needs and ultimately, ensuring that the most precious biodiversity and habitats continue to thrive, he said.Mr Lee, who is also minister-in-charge of social services integration, also said the Government must continue to support the mental well-being of Singaporeans, especially with the Covid-19 pandemic taking an emotional and psychological toll on many.He said the National Care Hotline has managed over 40,000 calls since it was set up by the health and social and family development ministries in April.The hotline provides a listening ear to help Singaporeans cope with the stress and anxiety brought on by the pandemic. Many of these calls resulted in follow-up action and interventions, said Mr Lee.He also stressed the need to go beyond state-led efforts to have a much bigger impact.He said: ""The Government can bring people together and provide support and resources, but it is often the community itself that best understands what the real needs are on the ground, and how these can be addressed.""The Youth Mental Well-Being Network formed in February last year, for one thing, has attracted over 1,000 sign-ups from the community and members have come up with some 30 potential projects so far.""All of us continue to grapple with an uncertain future,"" said Mr Lee.

There are also no precedent cases where a court has done so, they added.""We argued that, under the MCA, it is for the court to either revoke or decline to revoke an errant donee's powers. The court does not have the power to modify an errant donee's powers,"" said the firm, in a post about the case on its website.High Court Justice Debbie Ong last month found there was sufficient ground to revoke Y's powers to manage her father's property and affairs, in order to protect the donor's best interests. The judge, however, allowed her to remain as the donee in matters relating to her father's personal welfare.Justice Ong did not find it necessary to decide on whether the court indeed has the judicial power to modify a donee's powers or not, as she found that a modification would not be appropriate based on the facts of the case, according to the firm's post.Jacque Law managing director Jacqueline Chua said: ""Although it has been 10 years since the MCA has come into force, the law on mental capacity remains a developing area of practice.

Some shared that they now have Zoom work meetings in the night, which they never had before Covid-19,"" he said.In response, Mr Zaqy acknowledged that the current work-from-home arrangements have blurred the lines between work hours and personal time, and said it is important for the Government to examine how to better manage work-life balance.But he noted that such a ""right to disconnect"" law is relatively new around the world, with many countries, including Singapore, still observing its outcomes.""We must consider whether something like this would be relevant or rigid in Singapore's context, given that many of us do work for multinational firms or firms that work across time zones,"" he said.He also pointed out that enforcing work hours rigidly may negatively impact workers who currently enjoy the flexibility of running errands during the day and working at night instead.However, Mr Zaqy acknowledged that such concerns are important and could be raised as part of the discussion on the Advisory.Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) also asked if the Advisory would clearly state that employers should not request for information on the person's mental health condition, unless the condition has a direct connection with their ability to perform their job.In response, Mr Zaqy said: ""The Tripartite Advisory has not been announced, I can't confirm. But certainly we'll look into it.""He added that employers are currently already discouraged from asking for such information during the employment application process, where the job does not require it.""This is something that I think we need to hold strong to... rest assured... we want to make sure that the well-being of our workers are protected, both from the physical health state, as well as the mental health state,"" he said.",True

""It is where we feel most at home, that we are closest to in our hearts,"" she said.Professor Audrey Yue, who heads the department of communications and new media at the National University of Singapore's Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, offered a definition centred on both traditional and everyday culture.""Singapore is a land of old and new migrants. Through our ancestors... we continue to maintain traditional cultures, but also mix them with new practices and meanings,"" she said. ""This is important to the essence of who we are as a rich multicultural nation with diverse ethnic groups.""Everyday culture, on the other hand, is manifested through the likes of shared family values and language. ""For example, Singlish is quintessentially Singaporean - it is the soul of the nation, in a way,"" noted Prof Yue.For Dr Munidasa Winslow, a psychiatrist and chief executive of Promises Healthcare, a clinic focused on mental health and addictions, the answer lies in a sense of community.""We saw that during Covid-19. Within the first few weeks of the lockdown, psychologists, various ministries started putting together teams manning hotlines for anybody who needed to just call and talk about their feelings,"" he said. ""You can feel that whatever crisis comes at us, we're going to get through it.""An outside view was shared by Mr Asahi Takano, partner and Asia-Pacific head at Portas Consulting, a global management consultancy that promotes sport and physical activity.""One of the things that always struck me in Singapore is going into shops and trying to buy something, and an auntie or uncle in that shop would actually dissuade you because it's cheaper (at a shop) down the road,"" he said.""It's something I've not come across in many places and, to me, that hints at a certain Singaporean notion of solidarity - this idea of looking after each other and not wanting any of us to get ripped off.""Added Mr Takano, who was born in Japan and raised in Britain: ""That cuts to a lot of the things that Singapore is renowned for, in terms of multiculturalism and the focus on well-being and equality across society.""We can now forge a new narrative that resonates with the younger generation of Singaporeans.

Some, like suicide prevention centre Samaritans of Singapore, had felt decriminalising attempted suicide would encourage people with suicidal tendencies to seek help as they would no longer fear prosecution.Others, like Mr Murali, had expressed reservations, saying that keeping suicide a crime would allow police to intervene in suicide attempts by arresting and placing the person in a safe environment, like a jail cell, to stabilise their condition.On Wednesday (Nov 4), Mr Tan said the police were called to help with about 1,800 cases of attempted suicide or suicidal ideation from January to September this year.From 2017 to 2019, the police received about 1,200 reports of attempted suicide a year.However, Mr Tan pointed out that the two figures could not be compared, as the 1,800 cases so far this year includes suicide ideation cases - people who had suicidal thoughts but did not actually act on them.He said: ""The criminal justice system is not the best way to deal with persons who have attempted suicide. Such persons are often under severe distress.""Mr Tan added that the decriminalisation of attempted suicide reduces stigma and encourages suicidal people to seek help early.""The reasons for suicide are multifaceted and complex. Hence, the Government has been continuing our efforts to prevent suicides, and we will continue to monitor the situation and adjust our approaches to better assist suicidal persons,"" he said.Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah (Jalan Besar GRC) asked if mental health services in polyclinics could be made open to walk-ins rather than based on appointments or referrals in order to reduce treatment delay.In response, Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said people with mental health concerns who walk into polyclinics will be given a preliminary assessment by doctors. They will be referred to mental health services if necessary.Aside from polyclinics, more than 220 general practitioners have also been trained under the Mental Health General Practitioner Partnership Programme to identify, diagnose and manage those with mental health issues in the community.Dr Janil added that a network of 43 community outreach teams also provides basic emotional and psycho-social support and service linkage for persons with mental health issues across Singapore.Dr Wan Rizal also asked what the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) had done to ensure emotional and mental health wellness in workplaces.Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said that aside from an advisory on supporting the mental well-being of workers under Covid-19 work arrangements earlier this year, MOM will be releasing a Tripartite Advisory to guide employers on good workplace practices to promote workers' mental well-being later this year.He also highlighted a number of existing programmes and resources that employers can tap, including the iWorkHealth online self-assessment tool to identify common workplace stressors.""MOM will continue to work with our partners to educate and gain the support of employers to further promote workers' mental well-being at the workplace,"" he said.",True

A third charge of attempting to hurt the victim was taken into consideration.On the morning of Dec 8, 2019, the Malaysian commenced his shift at the ward. At about 10.30am, a patient in his 50s splashed urine on a nurse, who told Muhammad Ihsan.The accused then approached the patient and sprayed hand sanitiser into his face three times within six minutes.The victim, a long-term patient with chronic schizophrenia, tried to shield his face and wiped the hand sanitiser off his face using his shorts.Muhammad Ihsan also tried to hit the victim with his elbow, but the patient managed to dodge him.The victim later created a disturbance in the lounge. The accused, along with two other colleagues, restrained him.As they were doing so, the victim became agitated.Muhammad Ihsan then punched him in the face twice and kicked him in the shin. The victim suffered bruising around his right eye and the accused reported the injuries to IMH management.The patient was taken to Singapore General Hospital, where he was found to have also suffered bruising and a fracture on a toe.A human resource manager at IMH made a police report five days later, stating that the accused and his two colleagues who helped restrain the victim had physically assaulted the patient.Muhammad Ihsan's services as an IMH employee were terminated on Jan 9 last year.Deputy Public Prosecutor Phoebe Tan urged the court to jail the accused for 10 weeks, saying he abused the trust placed in him.Speaking through an interpreter, Muhammad Ihsan asked for leniency, saying he has family in Johor Baru depending on him.District Judge Teo Guan Kee said that nothing in his mitigation justified a reduction in the sentence asked for by the prosecution. But he said he would take into account the accused reporting the injuries.An IMH spokesman told The Straits Times: ""Two other staff were also investigated in relation to this incident... (they) are no longer employed by IMH.""IMH has apologised to the patient and his family... The patient... is still being cared for in our hospital for his mental health condition.""For voluntarily causing hurt to a vulnerable victim, Muhammad Ihsan could have been jailed for up to six years, fined up to $10,000, or both.",True

Anparasan made the contention after noting that while Madam Chan Hui Peng, 47, was warded at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) in July, she had the presence of mind to ask for her mobile phone to liaise with her lawyers about the lawsuit.He also noted that Madam Chan was lucid enough to make arrangements for the filing of the family company's annual returns to the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra).Madam Chan, a chartered accountant, who fell into a 1.8m-deep manhole while she was walking on a footpath in Simon Road near Kovan, is seeking about $5 million in damages.She alleges that the accident caused her to suffer post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and schizophrenia, in addition to a fractured ankle.Between June 29 and July 25 this year, she was forcibly warded at the IMH after she threw a bamboo pole out of the window following an argument with her husband, who she said was possessed.Mr Anparasan, who acts for PUB's insurers, referred to IMH clinical notes to point out that Madam Chan was lucid enough to ask for her mobile phone on July 16.But she told the court: ""I've been inside for three weeks without contacting a soul outside, my lawyers are looking desperately for me.""She said she was only allowed to use her phone under staff supervision to retrieve contact details.Madam Chan said it was her husband who had used her phone to send text messages to a director of the company regarding the Acra filing.She also pointed out that the clinical notes showed that when she was warded, she did not think she had schizophrenia.""I thought I was well but the doctors thought I was not and they did not want to let me go home,"" she said.Mr Anparasan also referred to notes from Sengkang General Hospital when he told the court that Madam Chan had impersonated her mother in a phone conversation with hospital officials in 2019.The officials had called her home number to talk to her mother, but the call was redirected to Madam Chan's mobile phone.Madam Chan, pretending to be her mother, then told the officials that she was against sending ""her daughter"" to IMH and preferred the patient to see her own private psychiatrist.Confronted on this on Tuesday, Madam Chan said she could not remember.""When I'm in psychosis, I do not know what is real and not real,"" she said.Mr Anparasan replied that it was a ""convenient excuse"".He also alleged that Madam Chan planned to launch a lawsuit against PUB soon after the accident.He referred to a letter dated Dec 9, 2015 - eight days after the accident - that her MP, Ms Sylvia Lim, had sent to PUB asking the agency to review their work procedures. The letter stated that Madam Chan was claiming compensation.

Second, it will develop a national mental health resources Web page to help individuals access useful and accurate information.Third, it will establish a national mental health competency training framework to standardise training curricula on mental health in the community.Task force chairman Chua Hong Choon told The Straits Times yesterday that the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) will lead the development of this framework.Its work will include coming up with a national curriculum for the management of mental health issues among front-line workers, and more training to bridge the knowledge gap in mental health among general practitioners.Professor Chua, who is the deputy group chief executive officer (clinical) of the National Healthcare Group, said the pandemic has had an adverse impact on people through the fear of infection, the loss of social connections, and the disruption to livelihoods.But it has also made people realise how prevalent mental health issues are, and it has given agencies renewed impetus to help those in distress.""This helped to de-stigmatise mental health conditions, and encourage more people to practise self-care and seek help from the community,"" said Prof Chua.There is a strong commitment at the government level to invest resources to strengthen mental health resilience in the population, he said, adding: ""There is a saying within the task force that as we vaccinate ourselves against the Covid-19 virus, building resilience is our 'vaccine' against mental health issues.""More details will be shared about the task force when they are ready.Dr Janil said in Parliament that Singapore is on track to meet its end-of-year targets for the Community Mental Health Masterplan, which was launched in 2012 and enhanced in 2017.In 2017, then Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor said there would be 50 community outreach teams and 18 community intervention teams by the end of 2021.Dr Janil told the House that the 50 community outreach teams have already been set up and reached out to more than 350,000 vulnerable people, including young people and their families, and elderly residents with their caregivers. There are also 21 community intervention teams now providing mental health interventions such as psycho-social therapeutic interventions and counselling. This has all come ahead of the previous deadline.Singapore also now has more than 220 general practitioners and 14 polyclinics that can provide patients with either mental health services or dementia services, or both.Refurbishment works at IMH, which began in 2018, are also expected to be completed by the end of next year.IMH will have a new short-stay unit to manage patients who need a few days of observation and treatment, six upgraded acute psychiatric wards that can be reconfigured for more efficient care of patients, and two new rehabilitative wards recreating a home-like environment to facilitate recovery.It will also have an upgraded child and adolescent psychiatry ward to provide inpatient psychiatric care for younger patients and an upgraded Addiction Medicine ward to facilitate the recovery and rehabilitation of patients.Dr Janil said: ""Our ability to get this far was the result of many years of investing in our people, facilities, systems, research and capabilities. We must learn the lessons from this experience. The preparations for the next crisis are under way and require that we keep ourselves and our healthcare system in good health.

She was then 14.His actions came to light only when the girl harmed herself and later told a psychologist about the incidents.The 38-year-old male teacher pleaded guilty on Tuesday (May 25) to two charges under the Children and Young Persons Act. Another similar charge was taken into consideration for his sentencing.He and the girl cannot be named to protect her identity.The court heard that he got to know her while moonlighting as a tuition teacher, providing lessons in mathematics and science to primary school pupils. He was the girl's tuition teacher in 2015 and 2016.He reconnected with her in 2018 after she created an Instagram account.In February 2019, he contacted her after she posted on her account that she was preparing appreciation cards for her schoolmates for a school event.The man asked for a card and she told him that it was for school but said she would make one for him anyway. A few days later, he drove to her school and picked up the card.He then gave her a lift to her home in his car.They started to text each other regularly after the meeting, with some messages being ""sexually charged"", said Deputy Public Prosecutor M. Kayal Pillay.In March 2019, the man told the girl that he had developed feelings for her. She wanted to reject him but was worried he would react badly, so she made it seem as though the feelings were mutual, added the DPP.While driving the girl home from school in April 2019, he stopped his car in Upper Thomson Road and kissed her lips. The girl, who was 14, did not wish to consent to the kissing, said DPP Pillay.Between early April to June 2019, the man invited her to his home on multiple occasions when his wife was not in. They met about once a week either at his home or a secluded area and would cuddle.In June that year, while they sat on the sofa in his living room watching a movie, he unbuttoned her blouse. She tried to button it back up, but he persisted.He then performed an indecent act.The girl did not report the incident as she was worried that people would laugh or spread rumours about her.She was also afraid that her parents would reprimand her.After the incident, she developed suicidal thoughts and harmed herself. She was taken to the hospital by her father.While being treated for depression in August 2019, she told the psychologist that the man had touched her. The psychologist then called the police.For each charge, a first-time offender convicted of committing an indecent act on a minor can be jailed for up to five years and fined up to $10,000.A repeat offender can be jailed for up to seven years and fined up to $20,000.Samaritans of Singapore: 1800 221-4444 (24 hours)Institute of Mental Health: 6389-2222 (24 hours)Singapore Association for Mental Health: 1800 283-7019 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)TOUCHline: 1800 377-2252 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)Brahm Centre Assistline: 6655-0000 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm)After hours: 8823-0000 (WhatsApp available)",True

A social recession, marked by loneliness and isolation, can be viewed as a fraying of social bonds that will further unravel the longer we go without human interaction.Thus, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's announcement that Singapore will transit into phase three of its reopening is welcome news indeed (S'pore to begin phase 3 on Dec 28, Dec 15). This is the first step in a long and arduous journey to lift Singapore out of economic recession and hopefully prevent a social recession here.As Singapore recovers from an economic recession, it must guard against loneliness in its communities. It was reported in October that more people in Singapore have been seeking help for mental health issues amid the Covid-19 pandemic, with a spike in calls to suicide helplines (More seek help for mental health issues amid pandemic, Oct 10).As Singapore's population ages, more seniors are living alone, whether by choice or otherwise.Some may still be living with their families, yet feel lonely. We need to guard against a future public health issue: a loneliness epidemic in Singapore.Loneliness is not a single emotion. It is a complex mix of many different emotional states such as anger, fear, grief, insecurity and uncertainty.There is a trend towards one-person households. In 2000, they made up 8.2 per cent of resident households in Singapore. That proportion is now 15 per cent, or 208,000 households.If we are not careful, many Singaporeans would experience social death - where they are treated as non-existent - before their physical death, often in isolation.The past year should be a wake-up call for Singapore on many levels, in terms of how we think about our society and its structural inequities; how we examine our support networks, how we think about living and what constitutes a good death; how we grieve; and how to strengthen our palliative care support in the midst of an economic and social recession.As Singapore reinforces its safe management regime in its fight against the virus, we must also reinforce our nation's social solidarity and networks and not allow social distance to be the default practice in our relationships with one another.Chen Jiaxi",True

While the recently announced pay rise for public healthcare workers will help address the shortage of nurses and caregivers, demand for nurses is expected to increase further as Singapore ages, said Ms Mariam.She wanted to know what was being done to enhance career paths for healthcare workers and address the top reasons they quit.This could include a review of shift structures and giving more support to nurses, she suggested.Coordinate community initiatives better

Ms Phua noted that on the long weekend before Chinese New Year, she met groups distributing lunch bento boxes to the same group of rental residents. She said: ""A common sight on the ground, especially in rental housing estates, is an overlap of services such as free distribution of food, masks and groceries; health screening and home cleaning.""She asked if there was an effective way of coordinating such initiatives so there is less wastage and better allocation of precious resources.Have mini social service offices
PHOTO: GOV.SG
To make it easier for families and people in need to seek help, Ms Pereira suggested mini social service offices (SSOs) in areas with rental blocks, where most residents who need help reside.""The mini SSOs can pull in the necessary resources from the neighbourhood or nearby precincts to help the varied needs of these vulnerable families and provide them with holistic assistance,"" she said.""Help can be more targeted as they cater to these few rental blocks.""Look beyond family violence
PHOTO: GOV.SG
Economic hardships are a trigger for more abuse in a relationship, Mr Zhulkarnain said.""During this pandemic, many survivors of domestic violence feel that they can no longer seek refuge at the home of a friend or relative, for fear they could expose them to the virus,"" he added. He asked if the task force on family violence would look beyond family violence to include violence against intimate partners and vulnerable groups like domestic workers and the elderly.Help couples facing marital distress
PHOTO: GOV.SG
Mr Yong asked if the ministry can examine ways to help couples identify early signs of marriage distress and help resolve such marital issues earlier.""I worry that the stress and anxiety from the prolonged pandemic might cause a further deterioration of relations in unstable marriages,"" he said.In cases where it is not possible to save the marriage, Mr Yong asked the ministry what its plans were to mitigate the impact of divorce on children.Ways to increase public transport usage
PHOTO: GOV.SG
To encourage higher usage of public transport, Mr Saktiandi suggested that transport operators explore issuing an integrated mobility ticket, which could offer reduced rates for transport services such as taxi, car-sharing and rental car services.E-tickets for large events like football games and music concerts can also be linked so that commuters will not have to pay for MRT and bus rides to and from those events, he added. The Government could also look into linking more existing feeder bus routes with MRT stations, especially the new ones.More flexibility for point-to-point drivers
PHOTO: GOV.SG
Ms Yeo suggested that the authorities allow point-to-point drivers to wait in and around taxi stand bays and drop-off points at night when there is less traffic on the road. Currently, only taxis are allowed to do so.She said this would reduce the need for drivers to drive around aimlessly, wasting fuel and time, amid reduced demand for rides and higher petrol duties.""We need to practise empathy, and indeed sympathy, towards the plight of our fellow Singaporeans.""Better access to Tuas mega port
PHOTO: GOV.SG
Mr Ang called for more transport options for maritime workers commuting to the Tuas mega port, which is located at the extreme end of western Singapore.He noted that the area is still relatively unconnected compared with the exiting city terminals at Tanjong Pagar and Keppel, which will progressively shift their operations to Tuas.He suggested that the Tuas West Extension MRT line be extended to the Tuas mega port.More public education on shared paths
PHOTO: GOV.SG
Mr Tan said there has not been much change in terms of people's awareness of how to properly use shared paths, despite the authorities' efforts.He urged the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to do more to make sure the general public - including the ""aunties and uncles who may get upset with people ringing the bell when cyclists are passing by"" - also get the message.""I would like to implore LTA to continue to work on this public education as well as consistent enforcement,"" he said.",True

Physical activity outside also often improves mental concentration and alertness.Dr Lim said most of his patients cited relationship problems, particularly with spouses and partners due to the long hours of having to face each other or due to having to fight over resources like the computer or work space.He added: ""Many have felt that working from home has resulted not only in physical distancing but also communicative and emotional distancing between colleagues.""They no longer receive the affirmations or reassurances from superiors and colleagues and find themselves wanting in their confidence, often not being sure if what they are doing for work is right or wrong.""",True

Or what animal guarded the gates of the former Middleton Hospital? And what about the good samaritan who worked behind the scenes to keep hospitals running during the Japanese Occupation?Mr Jerome Lim, independent researcher, heritage enthusiast and manager of award-winning local history blog The Long and Winding Road, takes us through lesser-known truths about these buildings of our medical history:
Old Changi Hospital was actually well liked by former British Royal Air Force (RAF) servicemen and their families, who regarded it as one of the best hospitals in the RAF. It reputedly had the best views as it was by the sea, making it an ideal place for rest and recuperation. PHOTO: JEROME LIM
The setting for countless local ghost stories and even a television drama, Old Changi Hospital – originally occupying two buildings put up in the 1930s when it was established in 1947 by the British colonial government as part of its military base camp in Changi – is arguably the most notorious of Singapore’s historic medical institutions.All manner of unsavoury characters are purported to roam its abandoned corridors, from an errant cabal of satanists performing forbidden rituals to sightings of soldiers walking around and the ghostly apparitions of a nurse with a child in her arms and that of a little boy who just sits and stares.But the most propagated myth by far is that the building served as a torture facility for the Kempeitai or Japanese secret police during the Japanese Occupation.
Old Changi Hospital is more than its haunted reputation. During its time under the RAF, it treated countless personnel. PHOTO: JEROME LIM
Fortunately – or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it – this story holds very little water, according to Mr Lim.While it was used as part of a prisoner-of-war (POW) camp for over 50,000 from February 1942, conditions were not as bleak as one would have expected. For instance, the Japanese forces were overwhelmed and let the captured British officers maintain order and discipline of the POWs in the camps. Then, after the establishment of the Southern Area College in Kitchener Barracks, they had access to education, sports and theatrical performances.As prisoners were gradually dispersed to various work camps around Singapore and Japanese-occupied South-east Asia, the number of POWs dwindled to the point where the camp was shut down in May 1943, and repurposed as a barracks for units constructing a nearby airstrip.In 1947, the British Royal Air Force (RAF) commissioned a full-time hospital for the RAF Changi base, repurposing Blocks 24 and 37 of the nearby barracks into RAF Hospital Changi. This would later become the beginnings of the Changi Hospital that operated until 1997.No recorded reports of Kempeitai torture on the premises actually exist.This venue is a State property managed by the Singapore Land Authority.
5 Kadayanallur Street was repurposed several times after World War II, serving as a medical store in 1946, Maxwell Road Outpatient Dispensary in 1964 and then an IOH Polyclinic in 1998 before it was put up for commercial adaptive use by the Singapore Land Authority. CK Tang Limited’s corporate office was located here for some time. PHOTO: SINGAPORE LAND AUTHORITY
Throughout its long and storied history, 5 Kadayanallur Street has gone by many names.From 1964 to 1998, the building served as the Maxwell Road Outpatient Dispensary. But many years before that, it became St Andrew’s Mission Hospital in 1923 before being repurposed as the Shimin Byoin, a hospital for women and children, by the Japanese Occupation Civilian Administration in April 1942.
In 5 Kadayanallur Street is one of the oldest lifts in Singapore. The lift was used to bring patients, such as children suffering from a type of tuberculosis affecting the bones, to the roof for fresh air and sunshine. PHOTO: JEROME LIM
Dr Ho Boon Liat, then its director, later wrote of the hospital’s wartime experiences in his book Syonan Interlude. A particular incident of note was the nightly visitations of a thief that would steal the eggs from the chicken cage up on the rooftop.The urgency of solving the crime was exacerbated by the scarcity of wartime sustenance; eggs were a precious commodity in Japanese-occupied Singapore.
The three-storey building was designed by Swan & Maclaren, the same architectural firm behind some of Singapore's most iconic buildings, including Raffles Hotel and Tanjong Pagar Railway Station. PHOTO: SINGAPORE LAND AUTHORITY
When the thefts continued, staff members conducted a stakeout, hoping to find the culprit from a list of suspects they had compiled.As it turned out, it was an inside job that put to rest the fact that the eggs had not been stolen. Instead, they had been claimed by the resident cockerel, who had hidden the evidence of its misdeeds so skilfully that even the other residents of the cage were none the wiser!This venue is a State property managed by the Singapore Land Authority.
The black lion was synonymous with the former Middleton Hospital. PHOTO: SINGAPORE LAND AUTHORITY
Many older Singaporeans are familiar with the former Middleton Hospital, with its two-storey gatehouse towering over Moulmein Green for over 70 years.Named after Municipal Health Officer Dr William R C Middleton (1893 to 1920), the hospital was more commonly referred to by locals as “orh sai” (Hokkien for “black lion”), thanks to the black lion that graced its entrance.The original black lion was removed along with the gatehouse during a road widening process in 1982. A different black lion then took its place at the entrance throughout the period of the building’s operation.Even after being rechristened as the old Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) in 1992, it is still referred to as “orh sai” despite there being no traces of the original black lion today.What does remain, however, is the unique layout of the premises. Initially given life in the 1910s as a hospital for infectious diseases like smallpox and cholera, the pavilion-style wards were built with a layout identical to hospitals of the time in England.
The pavilion-style wards of the old Communicable Diseases Centre were designed with good ventilation as a priority. PHOTO: SINGAPORE LAND AUTHORITY
This “state-of-the-art” design, in Mr Lim’s words, was in accordance with the prevailing English philosophy of curtailing the spread of infectious diseases by maximising ventilation.While zoned for future redevelopment under the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s Master Plan, the old CDC remains as a landmark until such time as it harks back to a time when space in Singapore was not under the same premium as it is today.This venue is a State property managed by the Singapore Land Authority.During the Occupation, Singapore General Hospital (SGH) was taken over by the Japanese, forcing its staff and patients to relocate to then-Woodbridge Hospital as it was repurposed as the Japanese military’s primary surgical centre.Enter Dr Kozo Ando, a long-time resident of Singapore and a graduate of the King Edward VII College of Medicine at SGH, Malaya’s leading medical school at the time.A private medical practitioner, Dr Ando soon found himself the officer-in-charge of the Civilian Medical Department in Singapore.He was noted by several of his local medical contemporaries as tireless in his attempts to help the local civilian populace. Chief among these was the subsequent relocation of Woodbridge Hospital personnel and supplies to the more central Tan Tock Seng Hospital, which made medical access much easier for less mobile patients.Dr Ando was also crucial in the execution of a vaccination drive that inoculated an estimated 650,000 people against malaria and 160,000 against cholera, as well as the distribution of antimalarial quinine tablets to the public.Dr Ando was responsible for the appointment of local doctors as directors of various civilian hospitals during the Occupation, including the relocation of the aforementioned Dr Ho Boon Liat (see section on St Andrew’s Mission Hospital) and his wife to St Andrew’s Mission Hospital, as well.Dr Ando returned to Japan in November 1943, but his legacy as a civilian medical administrator lives on as a rare light in a dark period of Singapore’s history.SGH marks its 200th anniversary this year.

Today, Loewen Road in Dempsey is one of Singapore’s trendiest lifestyle and retail destinations, with pet hotels, Korean barbecue restaurants and artisanal chocolatiers alike calling the small assembly of colonial-styled blocks home.Its relative isolation from the rest of Dempsey’s buildings, however, should give one a clue as to its initial purpose. In the late 1800s, when the shingles on the roofs were still made with attap palms, it served as Tanglin Military Hospital, the primary military facility for the British army until the opening of Alexandra Hospital in the mid-1940s.With Alexandra Hospital more centrally located and better-equipped with facilities, staff and medical supplies, the relatively remote location of Tanglin Military Hospital made it ideal for relegation to an isolation ward dedicated to the treatment of highly contagious venereal diseases and skin conditions that ran rampant among the troops at the time.The information given here barely scratches the surface of the history of Singapore’s medical institutions.If you just have to know more about Singapore’s medical history, you’re in luck.

Cases here reached 21,707 yesterday. The number of deaths stands at 20.But another set of numbers is also emerging, telling of the toll the pandemic and its associated measures have exacted on the mental health of people in Singapore.Globally, there has been a surge in the number of calls to mental health hotlines.CNN reported that calls to the United States' federal crisis hotline, Disaster Distress Helpline, spiked 891 per cent in March year on year. In China, hundreds of hotlines have sprung up and are inundated by callers, according to Reuters.In Singapore, the National Care Hotline set up to offer extra support has seen more than 6,600 calls by the end of the month since its launch on April 10.About 40 per cent of these calls were channelled to trained volunteers to administer psychological first aid.Of these, over one-third - some 1,000 people - needed more targeted support and were directed to help services such as counselling centres or specialised helplines.Ms Vivienne Ng, chief psychologist at the Ministry of Social and Family Development, noted that prolonged circuit breaker measures could have an impact on mental health.These include the psychological effects that come with social isolation, boredom, resistance to authority and family tensions.She is particularly concerned about an increase in depression among people over the medium to long term if there was a prolonged period of recession.Statistics show that those with pre-existing conditions and socially isolated seniors are especially vulnerable. But there is also a discernible impact on those without pre-existing mental illnesses.• National Care Hotline: 1800-202-6868MENTAL WELL-BEING• Fei Yue's Online Counselling Service: eC2.sg• Institute of Mental Health's Mental Health Helpline: 6389-2222• Samaritans of Singapore: 1800-221-4444• Silver Ribbon Singapore: 6385-3714• Tinkle Friend: 1800-274-4788MARITAL AND PARENTING ISSUES• Community Psychology Hub's Online Counselling platform: CPHOnlineCounselling.sgVIOLENCE OR ABUSE• Big Love Child Protection Specialist Centre: 6445-0400• HEART @ Fei Yue Child Protection Specialist Centre: 6819-9170• PAVE Integrated Services for Individual and Family Protection: 6555-0390• Project StART: 6476-1482• TRANS SAFE Centre: 6449-9088• TOUCHline (Counselling): 1800-377-2252• Care Corner Counselling Centre: 1800-353-5800• Agency for Integrated Care Hotline: 1800-650-6060At Whispering Hearts Family Service Centre, for instance, about 23 per cent of new cases last month came with family violence concerns compared with 14 per cent in April last year.Family violence increases anxiety and distress in victims and witnesses, and can lead to longer-term mental health challenges, said Ms Evelyn Lai, executive director of Viriya Community Services, which oversees Whispering Hearts.Surveys of the general population have also measured the different impact of the crisis on mental health.An online survey of 1,000 people here by market research company Ipsos between late April and early May found that one in four respondents said they were not in good mental health.Its findings are similar to an online poll by mental health charity Silver Ribbon, which found that a quarter of the 577 participants had experienced ""more than usual"" anxiety and feelings of low moods.In a Focus on the Family Singapore survey of over 1,000 mothers, three in 10 reported feeling sad most of the time and about half agreed that they did not find the same pleasure in activities they used to enjoy.Social worker Evangeline Yeh, founder of non-profit organisation Unity Movement, said she has counselled two clients who do not have mental illness but are now showing signs of it.One is a 45-year-old tutor who is so worried that her parents may get Covid-19 that she has insomnia, difficulty breathing and is experiencing obsessive compulsive behavioural symptoms of repetitive hand washing.The other is a 40-year-old business owner, who was so distressed over the company's survival and having to lay off staff that she would cry after team meetings.Said Ms Yeh: ""Without intervention, their mental distress is likely to worsen when Covid-19 ends as some of their debts and payments are suspended now but need to be addressed later.""Last month, a teenager suffering from depression committed suicide. According to her counsellor, the strain of being cooped up at home and a poor relationship with her parents contributed to her emotional turmoil, even though she had been trying to work through it.The case was one of the most severe seen by the counsellor, Ms Megan Tang, recently.READ MORE HEREIn the last month, 200 more children have contacted Tinkle Friend, a helpline for primary school pupils, such that more staff had to be trained to help man it.The children want to know if they will lose their friends whom they have not seen in weeks, and how to manage their online schoolwork. They also worry if their parents or they themselves will fall ill.READ MORE HEREOver 150 migrant workers who were feeling distressed have contacted HealthServe in the two weeks after it launched its virtual counselling clinic on April 20.Among these, three workers displayed more severe mental health symptoms that needed the psychiatrist's attention.

Asking ""how are you?"" is a simple first step to initiating a conversation with someone in distress, said Education Minister Lawrence Wong, SOS' patron, at the event's opening ceremony that was live-streamed on Facebook on Sunday.He noted that in the midst of the pandemic, the community's mental health needs are at its greatest. For instance, calls to SOS' 24-hour hotline saw an increase of almost 25 per cent during the circuit breaker, compared with the same period from March to May last year.The virtual walkathon takes place from Sunday to Sept 20, and SOS hopes that participants will clock a combined total of 5.5 million steps as a show of solidarity with those who feel lonely or isolated.SOS also aims to raise $150,000 through the event to support its work in serving those who are thinking of, or are affected by, suicide.Those who want to take part in the virtual walkathon can sign up for free at www.howru.sg, and submit their clocked steps on the 42Race Running & Fitness Club app. Donations can also be submitted through the website.Besides the walkathon, daily online programmes will be held throughout the week.They include a panel discussion on masculinity and mental health, a webinar on stress management, and a play staged by Singapore Polytechnic's Theatre Compass.

57,https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/leadership-in-the-new-normal-must-ensure-employee-well-being,Leadership in the new normal  must ensure employee well-being,"Dec 24, 2020","Workplace mental health has taken a front seat this year. Already deemed a ""highly stressed"" nation of workers, Singapore saw the Covid-19 pandemic bring a perfect storm of stressors to our shores with work-from-home arrangements blurring the line between employees' work and personal lives, social isolation as people stayed home while offices and shops were shut, fears about job security, and restrictions on travel.Prior to the pandemic, stress-related illnesses were already costing Singapore's economy $3.2 billion annually, according to a study last year. Whether organisations return to their workplaces or continue with their remote working arrangements, are employees ready for the new work normal? How can employers keep their workforce mentally healthy and future-ready in a post-Covid recovery?Last month, the much-awaited Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-being at Workplaces was released.The advisory outlines recommendations to prevent work stress from compromising well-being and productivity at the individual, team and organisational levels.As a member of the recent Tripartite Oversight Committee on Workplace Safety and Health, I very much welcome these recommendations, which are building blocks for creating a mental health-friendly workplace.Yet, these guidelines, while useful, risk becoming merely the responsibility of human resources departments. What is needed is to go beyond HR functions to build mental health into the new normal of leadership, to transform the culture of stigma to acceptance and inclusion.Leaders need to set the tone for inculcating employee well-being throughout the organisation. How leaders relate to mental health issues, what expectations they create, and whether they are able to view their employees as whole persons, influence the employee's experience at work. So introducing well-being initiatives, like having a mental health helpline for employees, without addressing organisational culture or leadership, is not really helpful.The good news is that mental health awareness is rising and more leaders are coming on board the issue. Since May 2018, an informal group of C-suite leaders across private and public sectors have committed to making workplace mental well-being a leadership priority. Calling ourselves the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup, the community has grown threefold this year to 75 chief executives and leaders.Over three CEO breakfast dialogues, numerous quarterly learning lunches and many one-to-one conversations, I have observed beliefs and behaviours from the work group members that demonstrate new possibilities in well-being leadership for employees and workplaces to adapt and thrive. They can be summarised into a ""4C"" leadership model to foster well-being.At the peak of the pandemic, Dr Daniel Tan, CEO of ParkwayHealth Laboratory and a member of the WorkWell Workgroup, wrote about his own state of burnout in an e-mail to employees. Then he found himself hesitating a little before he clicked ""send"".Change requires courage, and vulnerability may be the only true measure of strength. Other leaders of the work group such as Mr Hsieh Fu Hua (former CEO of the Singapore Exchange) and Mr Piyush Gupta (CEO of DBS Bank) have also shared their personal struggles with mental health, first within the work group and later with The Straits Times.When leaders share their own experiences with mental health, they validate that mental health is a continuum and can affect every one, not just some of us. Leaders such as Dr Tan, Mr Hsieh and Mr Gupta help open up that space of trust for their team members to know that having mental health difficulties does not mean they are less. This helps break the stigma, give hope and encourage help-seeking.They also become better leaders and managers in the process as they become more aware of who they are (and who they are not), as well as why or how they lead. There is a fierce courage in being able to say ""I am not perfect, and that is fine"".In a recent study by Qualtrics and SAP, nearly 40 per cent of global employees said that no one at their company had asked them if they were doing okay - and those respondents were 38 per cent more likely than others to say that their mental health had declined since the outbreak.Aviva CEO Nishit Majmudar shared at a recent dialogue earlier this month that his company has regular ""pulse checks"" to check with workers. ""It is through such listening that I know whether the culture that exists in a company is reflective of the one I want to build: a company with a heartbeat,"" he says. An advocate of compassionate leadership, he strongly believes that ""employees will go the extra mile and care for the company like their own if the company takes good care of them"".Now more than ever, people need to feel that employers care about them. Leaders may be firm and practical but they can always exhibit a level of compassion.However, if this compassion does not include themselves, it is incomplete. Leaders cannot pour from an empty cup. Self-care is important so that leaders can give the best of themselves, not the remnants of what is left after fatigue.Employees take cues from their leaders and look to them to see how they weather the storms of life. Therefore, leaders mustn't just say they support mental well-being, but must also role-model healthy behaviours so that their team members feel they can prioritise self-care and set boundaries.Finding that he was falling into a pattern of working from 8am to midnight almost every day with the work-from-home arrangement, Mr Kevin McGuigan, managing director of the South-east Asia region and Singapore country leader at American multinational corporation 3M, now steps away from his computer between 5 pm and 9 pm every day. He shared this change openly with his team members and encouraged them ""to look for ways to drive a better work-life balance"".Leaders like Mr McGuigan give permission through their actions and behaviours for staff to build the type of culture they wish to see in their organisation. Studies have found that organisations whose leaders are role models for prioritising health and work-life balance reported higher median satisfaction rates from employees for their workforce wellness efforts.Leaders must walk the talk on well-being because we are what we do, not what we say we will do.Offering clarity amid uncertainty is tricky, especially since leaders are expected to have all the answers.Authenticity in communication, and being equally open about what is clear and what is not clear is critical to establish trust. One way is by providing clarity of information simply, quickly and frequently, and by demonstrating that critical issues are being personally monitored by leaders.PwC Singapore convened a Work from Home Task Force comprising the firm's partners at the onset of the pandemic, which made sure employee mental well-being is on its agenda, shared Mr Sam Kok Weng, a senior partner of the firm.When leaders have a clear sense of purpose that ties back to the mission and values of the organisation, they are more able to inspire workers to feel confident and positive of their future. This fosters trust and builds goodwill.Clarity in words and actions can help employees feel safe, help them adjust and cope emotionally during a crisis like Covid-19. Such clarity also helps employees put their experience into context - and draw meaning from it.""We believe that we must treat everyone fairly to create psychological safety for employees to be themselves and to feel a sense of belonging to the company, regardless of who they are,"" shared Mr Koh Khai Yang, Asia-Pacific chairman of global energy research and consultancy group Wood Mackenzie.This year, in addition to adding mental health to the company's benefits programme for all, Mr Koh also made the groundbreaking decision to recognise the status of his employees' same-sex partners by extending the same spouse benefits to them as heterosexual couples.Leaders who live up to their values and take action to be consistent with what they believe in are never silent about hard choices, as leadership expert Brene Brown has noted. Mental health is a hard and complex challenge, made more so by Covid-19 and a future that is increasingly more volatile and uncertain as the nature of work changes.Yet, this ""crisis of a generation"", as many have termed the pandemic, has also presented an unprecedented opportunity for leaders in public and private sectors to move employee mental health and well-being up the priority chain.Instead of seeing the workplace as a source of stress, anxiety and mental ills that must be constantly mitigated, can leaders commit to making workplaces a source of mental well-being as our fundamental responsibility? When leaders show up with courage, compassion, congruence and clarity for well-being as a strategic priority, I believe we can.Anthea Ong is a former Nominated MP, a professional certified coach and a social entrepreneur who founded Hush TeaBar, A Good Space and the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup.",True

I'm just the same as my clients, or any other human being going through this.""She took frequent self-care breaks, when she would listen to relaxing music, read a book, or take a walk in the park.Mental health professionals here said they have had to attend to more cases over the past year. More clients were dealing with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts amid the pandemic.Mr Sam Roberts, centre director of Olive Branch Psychology and Counselling Services, said the organisation saw a spike in July last year, with cases increasing progressively till now.The Singapore Counselling Centre also saw a 40 per cent increase in the number of clients from 2019 to 2020, said its chief well-being officer, Mr John Shepherd Lim.Associate Professor John Wong, a senior consultant psychiatrist at the National University Hospital, said that stressors such as the derailment of school, work and social routines and financial woes, created a sense of hopelessness.Prof Wong added: ""These, when placed on a vulnerable individual already under strain, could tip one over to become suicidal.""Dr Jared Ng, a consultant at the Institute of Mental Health, said while suicidal acts are often impulsive, and crises leading to suicidal tendencies are often fleeting, what is most important is support from family and friends.Mr Joseph Rajagopal, senior counsellor at Singapore Counselling Centre, said: ""We need to be more receptive to receiving help and seeking help for our loved ones, instead of being hindered by the belief that we are going to be labelled as mental patients.""Mr Joseph said that as the first line of support for suicidal people, family members must go the extra mile and talk to them about their struggles.Ms Teo said people should be careful not to minimise the experiences of those vulnerable to suicide.She said: ""Even if you cannot walk that journey for them, you can walk alongside them.""She added that suicide was not a problem unique to any age group.The elderly who live alone, caregivers who had to care for young children, and students who were troubled by conflict at home were all vulnerable, said Ms Teo.Mr Jim Bek, 58, a counsellor working with youth, once saw someone jumping off a building and that motivated him to work harder for his clients.He said: ""Suicide knows no boundary of age, ethnicity, belief, or timeline.

Such persons are often under severe distress.""He added that the decriminalisation of attempted suicide reduces stigma and encourages suicidal people to seek help early.""The reasons for suicide are multifaceted and complex. Hence, the Government has been continuing our efforts to prevent suicides, and we will continue to monitor the situation and adjust our approaches to better assist suicidal persons.""Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah (Jalan Besar GRC) asked if mental health services in polyclinics could be made open to walk-ins rather than based on appointments or referrals, in order to reduce treatment delay.In response, Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said people with mental health concerns who turn up at polyclinics will be given a preliminary assessment by doctors.The polyclinic doctors will also provide appropriate management for those seeking help, including referring them to mental health services if necessary.Aside from polyclinics, more than 220 general practitioners have been trained under the Mental Health General Practitioner Partnership Programme to identify, diagnose and manage those with mental health issues in the community.Dr Wan Rizal also asked what the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) had done to ensure emotional and mental health wellness at workplaces.Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said that aside from an advisory on supporting the mental well-being of workers under Covid-19 work arrangements earlier this year, MOM will be releasing a tripartite advisory to guide employers on good workplace practices to promote workers' mental well-being later this year.He also highlighted a number of existing programmes and resources that employers can tap, including the iWorkHealth online self-assessment tool to identify common workplace stressors.""MOM will continue to work with our partners to educate and gain the support of employers to further promote workers' mental well-being at the workplace,"" he said.",True
61,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/covid-19-childhood,Covid-19 childhood,"Mar 07, 2021","Covid-19 has been a distressing time for most parents, but the pandemic is also leaving a mark on the young ones.To babies and toddlers, the world of mask-wearing and hand-sanitising is the only one they know.In the past year, they have been hearing and learning words like ""coronavirus"" and ""safe distancing"". They are being kept away from playgrounds and have fewer play dates, less physical interaction with people and smaller birthday parties, if any.Here are ways in which the little ones are being affected.According to a project in Britain tracking children under the age of two growing up amid the Covid-19 pandemic, 98 per cent of organisations working with families believe babies and toddlers have been affected by higher parental stress and anxiety.Parents face pressures like juggling childcare, overseeing schoolwork and managing their own work, financial loss and social isolation, said the January report by a group called First 1,001 Days Movement.This affected parent-child bonding, with nine in 10 service providers observing that babies were less active, with their primary caregivers spending less time playing with them.Last year, a local survey of about 1,000 mothers by charity Focus on the Family Singapore found that the pandemic and circuit breaker from April to June added to the physical and mental load mothers already carry at home.Sixty per cent of mothers reported stress levels of seven - or higher - out of 10. This is up from 52 per cent in a similar survey in 2019.Separately, another study of about 260 parents of children aged 12 and below here from April to May last year showed how Covid-19 had affected parenting adversely.Parents who felt more stressed by the effects of the pandemic - whether tighter finances or poorer mental well-being - indicated that they were fiercer with their kids, said the study.This meant they resorted to more caning, spanking, yelling and using harsher words.The poll was conducted when Singapore's circuit breaker and full home-based learning were in place.Parents surveyed also felt they were not as close to their children during that period.""Parenting under typical conditions is already difficult, as many parents struggle to balance work and parenting duties,"" the study, which was published online last September in the Journal of Family Violence, reported.""During lockdowns, when families remain at home for prolonged periods of time, parents must perform multiple roles with fewer resources and less support than they previously received from schools, churches, neighbourhoods and other family members.""This causes significant stress and, for some parents, the loss of a job or reduced wages worsens the stress, noted the study by social work researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and National University of Singapore.Another challenge for young children is learning to read people's facial expressions with faces half-covered by masks.The reduction in social interaction in the past year may also have contributed to increased stranger anxiety among toddlers, said paediatricians.Speech development takes place rapidly during the early years, especially in those aged two to three. Studies have shown that visual cues are important in helping children to identify emotions and express themselves during social interactions.They now have to rely on other cues, such as tone of voice and body language.With mask-wearing set to be in place for a while, pre-schools have found ways to work around it.For instance, they may get teachers to wear face shields instead of masks, or use masks that have a transparent portion over the mouth when they are reading a book or teaching phonics.Teachers are also paying more attention to children's non-verbal cues, like body language and gestures.On the bright side, families have reported having more time to recharge and reconnect with one another during the pandemic, when many activities came to a halt.Some started shared hobbies or routines like gardening or board games, and were able to spend more quality time together.In a Focus on the Family Singapore survey of 1,052 children aged 10 to 15 last year, more than seven in 10 kids said they were close to their parents.Work-from-home arrangements have also allowed fathers to step up at home, and the charity's poll of 1,000 mothers found that those who indicated their spouse as their main source of support reported significantly lower stress.Its findings from a separate poll of about 2,400 fathers also noted that eight in 10 connected better with their children last year.National Care Hotline: 1800-202-6868• Fei Yue's Online Counselling Service: eC2.sg• Institute of Mental Health's Mental Health Helpline: 6389-2222• Samaritans of Singapore: 1800-221-4444• Silver Ribbon Singapore: 6385-3714• Tinkle Friend: 1800-274-4788Community Psychology Hub's online counselling platform: CPHOnlineCounselling.sg• TOUCHline: 1800-377-2252• Care Corner Counselling Centre: 1800-353-5800 Get the ST Smart Parenting newsletter for expert advice.

The plan will be implemented in phases, with the first phase expected to be ready by early next year.Professor Chong Yap Seng, a member of the action plan's work group, said they will look at how to keep women in good physical and mental health for motherhood, support the development of a healthier next generation and reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity through sustained lifestyle changes.Prof Chong, who is the executive director of the Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences, A*Star (Agency for Science, Technology and Research), said that poor mental health in pregnant women has been shown to have an adverse impact on their children.Nearly 40 per cent of the mothers in the Gusto study had high levels of depressive symptoms, which were associated with changes in their babies' brains on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at birth, which persisted even at four years of life, he said.""The children of mothers with high levels of depressive symptoms also performed poorer in tests of their socio-emotional regulation, executive function, reasoning, memory and other pre-academic skills at four years of age.""Prof Chong, who is the study's lead principal investigator and dean of the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, said that other studies have shown that mental health disorders are a major burden among children and adolescents in Singapore.""Approximately one in 10 pregnant women exhibits clinical symptoms of depression. One in 25 women has depressive symptoms after delivery that required intervention,"" said another action plan work group member, Associate Professor Chan Yoke Hwee, who is chairman of the division of medicine at KK Women's and Children's Hospital.""This problem is not uncommon, and can be detected through systematic screening and assessment. However, the challenges lie in raising awareness in the society about this issue and encouraging women to undergo assessment and intervention if required.""Prof Chong said: ""Pregnancy is like national service, so employers have to be fair to them. Maybe maternity leave needs to be enhanced or lengthened.""In coming up with various initiatives, the task force will also help to boost flagging fertility rates and reduce the mental health burden in mothers and children, he said.Furthermore, Singapore has one of the highest rates of gestational diabetes in the world. These mothers have a two in five chance of going on to have diabetes or pre-diabetes within the next six years and their children will have a higher risk of obesity, diabetes and neuro-behavioural issues, said Prof Chong.""Women are starting their families later and having (fewer) children. We are not replacing ourselves. Beyond this scary demographic reality, older mothers will have more health issues during pregnancy,"" said Prof Chong.""The Government recognises that a lot of health and well-being issues stem from early life...

I therefore urge the Government to invest more resources on mental healthcare as insufficient support could lead to dire consequences, especially in this prolonged period of uncertainty, anxiety and fear,"" Mr Yong said.Mr Choo pointed out that vulnerable households, like single-parent families, may require more help and support.The MPs also pointed to the lessons learnt from telecommuting, particularly about gender norms and caregiving duties.The circuit breaker has forced ""many of our families to experience first-hand, and more than ever before, the maniacal task of balancing work, household and childcare duties"", said Mr Choo.The challenge is not new to many women, he added, noting that flexible work arrangement has been framed as support for caregivers, especially women on maternity leave or with young children.""We have framed it that women need more support. Covid-19 has torn up such a frame. It is still true that they need more support. But that support must be a family-based one with men strongly leaning in and making that change,"" he said.""The post-circuit breaker and Covid-19 workplace will not and must not be the same,"" he added.He also said that many companies such as Facebook, Twitter and large banks are preparing to build resilience in their workforce by having some telecommute permanently.Perhaps, it also help them reap savings from reducing city office rentals and lost productivity from commuting, Mr Choo added.The same right to flexible work arrangement should be considered in Singapore, he added.These potential upsides were echoed by Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) as well.The greater support for working from home may mean greater opportunities for mothers seeking to re-enter the workforce, he said. ""The strong uptake of digitalisation and support for telecommuting will provide opportunities job-seekers in previous generations would find it hard to imagine.""",True
66,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/more-support-earlier-intervention-can-help-family-lawyers,"More support, earlier intervention can help family: Lawyers","Oct 18, 2020","More needs to be done to support caregivers who may struggle to look after a family member with mental health conditions and other issues, said lawyers with experience in such cases.While intervention and treatment for mental health conditions seem like simple solutions, lawyers said the law now has provisions to order a psychiatric assessment to diagnose mental health issues only when someone has committed or is suspected of committing a crime.But sometimes, it is a little too late for interventions.Two years ago, Mr Tan Tian Chye hit his mentally ill daughter with a pole and strangled her to death after feeling overwhelmed by the immense pressure of caring for her.A psychiatric report found that Mr Tan, 66, had a major depressive episode and significant caregiver stress while trying to pacify the needs of Ms Desiree Tan Jiaping, 35, court documents said.Ms Tan was assessed in 2012 to have panic attacks with agoraphobia - a condition that made her anxious in unfamiliar environments, and ""hypochondriacal preoccupations"" or anxieties linked to health.She was also diagnosed in 2018 with an unspecified anxiety disorder but refused medication - she was afraid she would become dependent on it. Last Monday, Mr Tan was sentenced to two years and nine months in jail but the sentence was backdated so he was released on the same day.High Court judge Hoo Sheau Peng in court papers said: ""As a society, it is critical to continue with efforts to improve and enhance access to mental health services. It is unfortunate that much needed help, support and intervention were not sought by or given to the Tan family during those years for their daughter, and thereafter, for the accused.""While support can be given to those who ask for it, lawyers said under the law, no one can be forced to be assessed or get treatment for mental health issues unless they do something dangerous to themselves or others.For those who have been diagnosed with mental illness, the court can order treatment only after the person is sentenced for a crime.Veteran lawyer Amolat Singh said: ""On one hand, this makes sense because then anyone can point the finger and ask for someone to be remanded, and we're talking about taking away someone's liberties here. The question is, how do you create checks and balances that won't be abused. What should be the triggering mechanism for a person to be sent for treatment.""Mr Sunil Sudheesan, the head of the criminal department at Quahe Woo & Palmer, said the question of when to intervene is a grey area since those suffering from mental illnesses do not always pose an immediate danger to themselves or someone else.He said: ""The first thing is for caregivers to know how they can receive help. The next thing is to consider various forms of intervention and where to peg that intervention, meaning how to intervene and when the line is crossed. Now, it seems like serious intervention only takes place when a crime occurs. This may be too reactionary.""Lawyers said Mr Tan's case is not the first time caregivers have felt out of their depth dealing with a family member with mental health or other conditions.For instance, in 2014, a mother of a seven-year-old autistic boy pushed him out of the window of their ninth-floor Tampines flat after she was seized by thoughts that he was the reason for her exhaustion and marital problems.In 2016, the 43-year-old woman was sentenced to five years' jail for culpable homicide. She was found to have suffered a relapse of a major depressive disorder she had faced since 2008.Her lawyer Anand Nalachandran said in court that she sacrificed her own well-being for the family's needs and was stretched to breaking point. Before the incident, she had never hurt her son.Speaking to The Straits Times last week, Mr Anand said: ""Over the years, there have been many cases involving psychiatric conditions with varying backgrounds. This tragic case highlighted the impact of caregiver stress.""Criminal lawyer Amarick Gill said the ""saddest case"" he has worked on in a career spanning 21 years involved a single mother who pushed her nine-year-old son out of a fifth-storey window in 2013.Then 31, the mother was the primary caregiver of the boy and had a history of schizophrenia while her son had medical conditions that left him jaundiced with brittle bones. She was sentenced to 10 years in prison for culpable homicide.Mr Gill said: ""If there had been earlier intervention for her, and treatment for the schizophrenia, she could have been taken into care and this tragedy could have been avoided.""He hopes an islandwide census can be drawn up to flag low-income families with history of mental illnesses, and who may not have the means to be assessed and get help if necessary.Referring to his former client, he said: ""There are more families out there like hers. I hope people will start coming forward.""",True

Maybe maternity leave needs to be enhanced or lengthened.""He noted that women are also starting their families later and having fewer children.Prof Chong said: ""We are not replacing ourselves. Beyond this scary demographic reality, older mothers will have more health issues during pregnancy.""The Government recognises that a lot of health and well-being issues stem from early life... There is a need to protect and optimise our human capital.""",True

She is also better now with treatment.The demonstrations on Tuesday came after a number of incidents this year made the headlines.In February, officers had to force their way into a Toa Payoh flat after a 64-year-old man locked himself in his room and threatened to commit suicide.In the room, the man was seen holding a canister of butane fuel and a lighter in his hands before he is said to have charged towards the officers.The man was arrested after he allegedly stabbed a police officer in the thigh. The police officer is no longer in hospital.

Another incident in March involved a 38-year-old Caucasian man who had locked himself inside a residential unit.Officers entered the unit nearly four hours after the initial call for help. They had assessed that he posed a danger to himself.The man was arrested under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act. He was also investigated for consumption of controlled drugs.The longest stand-off was 17 hours. It involved a drug abuser who took his girlfriend's toddler hostage in a Sembawang flat in 2016.Such stand-off situations can be difficult to handle, especially since the approach is to minimise harm and uncertainty, said AC Tan.""This is why we need so many resources,"" he added.Their resources include the Crisis Negotiation Unit (CNU) and Special Operations Command.The CNU includes police officers and psychologists who are trained in negotiation tactics.

One of the tools of their trade is active listening, said principal psychologist Ho Hui Fen.""We will reflect certain contents and certain words that a person may be saying. We may try to reflect feelings, try to mirror what they are feeling,"" she said.But handling these incidents can take an emotional toll on psychologists, added Ms Ho.""It can be heart-wrenching to see some family members having to cope with the struggles they are having with the person, especially those with chronic mental health issues who can be violent or suicidal. The psychologists do check in, talk and share with one another as a form of coping mechanism,"" she said.

Individuals can be detained by the authorities under the Mental Health (Care & Treatment) Act if they refuse treatment and are assessed to pose a risk to themselves or others.Between January and March this year, 723 patients were admitted to Institute of Mental Health (IMH) under the Act.Total admissions under the Act in 2019 was 2,768, and 2,510 patients last year.Responding to queries from The Straits Times, a senior consultant of emergency services at IMH, Dr Jared Ng, said that the patients taken to the institute under the Act are usually either suicidal or are suspected to be of unsound mind.""All reports of possible suicidality are taken seriously as one life lost to suicide is one too many,"" said Dr Ng.Those who need emergency medical treatment are first taken to the nearest Ministry of Health-designated hospital. They are then taken to the IMH emergency services (ES) for psychiatric assessment.""At IMH ES, the doctor would perform a thorough psychiatric assessment and determine if the patient requires inpatient treatment, or whether he or she can be discharged from the hospital and followed-up either as an outpatient or by care agencies in the community,"" explained Dr Ng.The assessment includes a psychiatric interview, physical examination and medical investigations.For patients diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, treatment includes medication and psychological treatment.Under the Act, a person may first be admitted to IMH for 72 hours, during which he or she is assessed and treated for any mental health conditions.The period of the mandatory admission can be increased if the patient requires continued treatment in IMH due to his psychiatric condition, and if this is in the best interest for the health and safety of the patient or others around him.The team will also work with caregivers and community partners to address other psycho-social issues and concerns and ensure that safe, holistic and quality care continues beyond the admission, said Dr Ng.He added: ""Patients will not be kept in the hospital beyond what is necessary. We believe that care can be delivered in the community and once it is safe for patients to be discharged, we will do so.""Toa Payoh, 2021A man was arrested after he locked himself in the bedroom of a Toa Payoh flat and stabbed a police officer in the thigh on Feb 8.The incident happened at Block 124 Lorong 1 Toa Payoh.

They found him holding a canister of butane fuel and a lighter in his hands.One of the police officers, 28, was stabbed in the left thigh with a knife, allegedly by the man.Sembawang, 2016A drug abuser who held his girlfriend's two-year-old son hostage caused a 17-hour stand-off with police. It remains the longest stand-off the authorities here have dealt with.Muhammad Iskandah Suhaimi, then 40, had locked himself and the boy in a flat after he told his girlfriend to buy him cigarettes.Officers from the Special Operations Command forced their way into the flat by breaking a window and removing the front gate when Iskandah was in the toilet. They arrested him and rescued the boy.In March 2018, he was sentenced to five years' jail and six strokes of the cane for kidnapping the toddler, possessing and consuming methamphetamine, and for illegally possessing a knuckleduster.Bukit Merah, 2005Lim Ah Seng, then 37, was arrested following a four-hour stand-off.Lim was armed with two knives and had slammed the front door shut, refusing to let the police officers in.

Any hiring decisions that are not merit-based may be in breach of the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices.The Guidelines say that employers should not discriminate against potential employees on the basis of age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, and disability. This list is not exhaustive and highlights more common examples of discrimination. Tafep will look into all cases of workplace discrimination, even if they arise from attributes not cited as examples in the Guidelines.If an employer lists a hiring requirement that is not merit-based or relevant to the job, the onus is on him or her to prove grounds for excluding candidates on this basis.In your case, Tafep would find the employer discriminatory if he or she is unable to reasonably justify why individuals with mental health conditions cannot do the job. Tafep works closely with the Ministry of Manpower to take action against employers who do not abide by the Guidelines.A: Before starting the hiring process, you should ensure that your job application forms only collect information directly related to the qualifications, skills, knowledge and experience required for the role.All declarations on mental health conditions should be removed from job application forms. People with mental health conditions can contribute actively and perform well at the workplace, and you should assess this candidate based on objective criteria related to the job scope.Examples of other fields that should not be included are age, gender, race, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, and disability; these are not exhaustive. You should clearly state reasons for collecting information that may be viewed by jobseekers as discriminatory.If a jobseeker brings up his mental health condition during the interview or upon selection, you are encouraged to have an open and honest conversation with him to find out more about his needs and explore how existing work arrangements can meet his needs.For instance, you can consider extending your organisation’s flexible work arrangements to the employee for occasional medical follow-ups. At the same time, you should help the jobseeker to accurately understand the demands of the job scope by making your expectations clear and coming to an understanding on what is required of him.Avoid unconscious biases, especially in the way you hire and treat your employees. For help or guidance, read the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices or attend a clinic conducted by Tafep to review whether your employment practices are fair and progressive.Advice and guidanceTafep helps employers build workplaces where employees are respected, valued and able to achieve their fullest potential for the success of the organisation.If you face workplace-related discrimination or unreasonable employment practices, you can submit an online report at tafep.sg/contact-us or call 6838-0969 to speak to a Tafep officer.Tafep’s operating hours are Monday to Friday, 8.30am to 5.30pm, excluding public holidays.Brought to you by",True

And also, when they need help, help must be available to them.""Managers, too, should be trained to spot signs and symptoms associated with mental health issues, he said.On Tuesday, the Ministry of Manpower, National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) released a tripartite advisory providing guidance and resources on mental wellness.It called on companies to recognise the need for their staff to have adequate rest outside work hours, by establishing a work-life harmony policy offering clarity on after-hours work communication.Mr Ng said the advisory was timely, and the WSH Council will be ramping up discussions on mental health at the workplace.On Wednesday, NTUC assistant secretary-general Melvin Yong, who was also part of the panel at the virtual conference with Mr Ng, said tripartism will need to be ""even tighter"" as the world is evolving rapidly and the nature of work is changing.The future workplace will be one that is smarter, more manpower-lean, and more connected, he said.For example, artificial intelligence will eventually lead to the mundane jobs being phased out, while improvements in connectivity such as the 5G networks will increase the possibilities for remote working, he added.SNEF vice-president Douglas Foo, who was also on the panel, said while Singapore is going through a challenging period, tripartism has given Singapore a leg-up, with the latest advisory coming in helpful for many enterprises in managing mental health at the workplace.",True

75,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/electric-dreams-the-future-of-mental-healthcare-is-digital,Electric dreams - the future of mental healthcare is digital,"Feb 07, 2021","Mental health is the defining problem of our generation.It has all the elements of a complex social-scientific problem. While pervasive, mental disorders are grossly under-diagnosed. There is lack of awareness of the issue, and sufferers face stigma, little engagement and a variable quality of care.In the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study, mental disorders were the second leading contributor to years lived with disability. Studies by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) further show that the lifetime prevalence of mental disorders in Singapore has increased from 12 per cent in 2010 to 13.9 per cent in 2016.What is of concern is that more than three-quarters of those with a mental disorder in their lifetime did not seek professional help.Covid-19 has put the spotlight on mental health.There is not only anxiety about the virus, but the accompanying economic and societal consequences. As we begin to address the ensuing mental health tsunami, we envisage a long-term process with no easy solutions.Mental disorders affect an individual's cognition, emotion and behaviour.Often, a change in behaviour is the presenting symptom.Unlike a typical medical consult, where a physical examination or blood test might reveal the diagnosis, mental health assessment relies on verbal cues from the patient and other sources. At times, such information might be incomplete or even contradictory.There is much need for objective data to guide diagnosis and treatment.Smart devices are the hallmark of the 21st century. With the increasing digitalisation of our lives, there are opportunities to tap into existing data sources to provide clinical insights into our health status.Such digital biomarkers provide objective physiological and behavioural data obtained from sensors that we wear or carry.Beyond physical activity and heart rate, data on geolocation, sleep, sociability from messaging, phone calls and social media are readily available.Paired with advanced analytics, a digital phenotype or profile can be put together, which allows the individual to be more informed about his or her own health status.Understanding the mental health of patients remotely - especially those with severe illness, enables better patient-centred care. This disrupts the current health delivery model, with a shift from traditional in-person clinic visits to continuous health status monitoring.Re-thinking ways to treat mental disorders call for new approaches to generate insights and evidence to drive decision-making.Patients can input their health status via sensors or self-reported outcomes; clinicians can enter test results and treatment plans; and digital platforms can monitor adherence to treatment and track progress over time.There is a need for timely and proactive engagement of the patient, to empower greater involvement in his or her own health. Whether it is through serious games (or gamification), emotionally intelligent chatbots or algorithm-initiated medical consults, the need for informative and interactive solutions is pronounced.Companies such as digital health and data science firm Holmusk have developed hybrid-AI platforms to support decision-making in mental health. This collates, organises and analyses real-world data in behavioural health and psychiatry, and develops predictive models to enable better patient care.Treating mental disorders has also gone online.Internet-based behavioural therapy and tele-therapy sessions with mental health professionals are initial forays which have taken greater prominence following Covid-19.Digital phenotyping, coupled with digital therapeutics, promises powerful new tools for the doctor's repertoire.It engages the patient, provides real-time feedback, and facilitates meaningful discussions with the healthcare team around treatment goals and plans.A milestone was reached in 2017, when the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ""reSET"", a prescription digital therapeutic for substance use disorder.Developed by Pear Therapeutics, this app is prescribed in place of a pill or injection, to deliver clinically-validated interventions.While ""reSET"" was the first approved digital therapeutic, there are many others in the pipeline for insomnia, migraine, schizophrenia and other conditions.Digital platforms permit rapid scaling to large groups of users. This has become invaluable in the pandemic, where entire populations encounter extraordinary stressors at the same time.These platforms deliver health information, resources and interventions to anyone with Internet access and enable early identification of those who require professional help.In June 2020, mindline.sg was launched to provide self-assessment tools and a compendium of resources for emotional well-being. This was enhanced in October to include ""Wysa"", an emotionally intelligent AI chatbot to help users manage stress and emotions through evidenced-based self-help techniques.Even as we take first steps, there will already be transformation of healthcare delivery from the clinic to online consultation and care. However, the real transformation will come when we enhance the level of engagement and the effectiveness of care itself.While the technologies to disrupt mental healthcare are already available, taking them into the clinic may not be so simple. There is a need for clinicians to work closely with patients, engineers, social workers and public health agencies to test, validate and field new ways to manage mental health in the community.For a start, we need to determine what is medical information that is stored and accessible in electronic health records, and what is private that goes beyond a doctor-patient relationship.As we collect pervasive data about an individual's activities, behavioural choices and sleep patterns, we need to balance actionable medical information and patient privacy.Health authorities have been grappling with how to regulate digital products, whether these are for monitoring disease or providing therapeutic interventions. Singapore's Health Sciences Authority (HSA) approved its first digital therapeutic as recently as June 2020, the first regulatory agency to do so outside the US.The challenge remains to develop regulatory pathways to approve such products, without forgoing the rigorous clinical efficacy and safety trials required for all other classes of medical products.Digital therapeutics need to be integrated within existing health systems. This requires not only approved software and hardware, but evidence-based clinical practice guidelines.Physicians will need to be educated on how to prescribe digital apps, how to monitor compliance, and how to assess clinical outcomes.Finally, we need to review how prescription and treatment costs can be reimbursed, including whether these are covered by medical insurance and other payment schemes.Incentives can also be in-built to enhance patient acceptance and adherence to therapy.The future of mental healthcare is digital.Developments will change how clinicians diagnose, monitor and manage mental disorders, taking treatment from the clinic into each patient's mobile device.This goes beyond developing software.There is a concurrent need to address pertinent issues relating to patient confidentiality, safeguards for data privacy, treatment models, regulatory pathways, reimbursement of costs, as well as patient and physician adoption.Reimagining mental healthcare is the easy part, making it happen will take time. We have to do better than the current state of mental healthcare - that is our goal.About the writers• Dr Jimmy Lee is a Psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health and Associate Professor at the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University;• Mr Nawal Roy is Founder and CEO of Holmusk; and• Professor Benjamin Seet is Deputy Group CEO (Education and Research) of the National Healthcare Group and Adjunct Professor at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine.",True

Strengthening mental health of our young is a whole-of-society effort,"" she added.The awards are meant to acknowledge and applaud the effort of schools in holding workshops and talks for staff and students and encouraging students to embark on mental-health related projects, among others.The recipients were Nanyang Technological University, River Valley High School, PSB Academy, Singapore Management University and Singapore University of Social Sciences.In her speech, Silver Ribbon (Singapore) president Ellen Lee said one in four young people experienced low mood, loneliness and anxiety amid the Covid-19 pandemic.This was based on an online survey the organisation did in April 2020 involving 577 young people.She added that the Silver Ribbon team has been working closely with its stakeholders to identify and address the gaps to combat mental health stigma and to encourage early help.""We encourage more schools to come forward and join us in creating a friendly and mentally healthy learning environment for youth and future generations of Singapore,"" Ms Lee added.At the ceremony, River Valley High School vice-principal Alvin Lau said that the school had implemented a positive education framework for teachers and trained peer support leaders to provide mental health support for its students.""We actually teach our students about mental health issues in lessons... to help raise their awareness - what are mental health issues, what are the symptoms - so that they can recognise the signs in themselves and their peers,"" said Mr Lau.He added that it is important to create a caring and enabling environment.""They actually can apply what they have learnt and look out for each other.""By having a good relationship with their peers, the school will also have a conducive environment. The students will be happy to come to school and their school life will be happy... and (this will) prevent them from falling into negative thoughts and having anxiety issues,"" said Mr Lau.",True

The project ended on Feb 6.After the call, Mr Yeo was able to track down three of the men at the void deck of the block.He asked them for their fund-raising permits as well as the postcards, which were found to be without serial numbers. The permits also appeared to have been forged.Mr Yeo reported the matter to the police that day.Investigations found that one of the men, Collin Ang, 18, responded to an online advertisement on ""getting fast cash"" and was contacted by a ""Kingston"" on Telegram who gave him a blank template of a fund-raising permit.Ang then shared the template with Waynne Tang, 19, and they agreed to use the template to create a forged fund-raising permit to carry out a fraudulent charity collection.Tang then used a postcard which he bought from Club Heal to create other forged postcards.Tang then recruited Chia, who then recruited Jovan Tay, 20.Ang, Tang and Tay have been charged and their cases are pending.Each postcard was sold for $10 each. Seventy per cent of the amount collected was kept by whoever carried out the sale, while the remaining amount was shared among the other three.Under The House to House and Street Collections Act, Chia can be fined up to $5,000, jailed for up to two years, or both.",True

Almost two-thirds said they were now more likely to use cashless payments and 46 per cent reckoned they were more likely to order food delivery rather than go for other dining options.Prof Tan said a poll finding that 52 per cent of those employed felt their workload had increased since the circuit breaker began could be due to a reduction in headcounts or working from home blurring the boundary between work and non-work time.This could have resulted in a stronger pressure to respond to e-mails immediately at any time of the day.He added that people may feel the need to work harder to overcompensate for the lack of ""face time"", which some bosses prefer.

""If these mean no work-life balance, then it's a bad thing,"" said Prof Tan.He added: ""I think the increasing pace of work life was already happening before the pandemic.""The pandemic merely makes it worse - and I can't see returning to pre-pandemic levels, especially if there are lower headcounts, and more travelling to and from work and business travels involved.""The poll unearthed other downsides as well - 36 per cent saying their mental health had worsened.Mental health has been under the spotlight since the pandemic started and the survey found that 31 per cent reported their mental well-being had ""somewhat worsened"". Five per cent said it had worsened ""much more"".In October last year, the Government convened a Covid-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce in response to the needs of Singaporeans arising from the pandemic.In March, it was announced that the task force would be transformed into an inter-agency platform to oversee mental health and well-being efforts beyond the pandemic.The head of the task force, Professor Chua Hong Choon, declined to comment specifically on the finding in which 36 per cent of respondents in the survey acknowledged that their mental well-being had worsened.But he said that generally, there were several reasons why people's well-being may have worsened since the circuit breaker.""Humans are social animals and the circuit breaker heightened our loss of social connectedness, affecting people of all ages,"" said Prof Chua, who is also deputy group chief executive officer (clinical) of the National Healthcare Group.He said working adults may have seen relationships with colleagues fray and stress levels rise due to work-from-home arrangements. ""The social aspect of work was lost, teams were not able to bond and people were stressed out by technical issues at home,"" said Prof Chua.

Seniors could have experienced a sense of isolation because extended family members were unable to visit and they could not meet their friends regularly.""The disruption to our economy also affected the livelihoods and career opportunities of many residents, although timely support by the Government has helped to cushion the impact,"" he added.While the task force had previously presented plans to help tackle the issue, Prof Chua said that there were things people could do to help one another.In addition to looking out for one another's well-being, people could consider volunteering or participating in community mental health events to learn more about mental health issues, and encourage others to do so as well, he said.""In our daily lives, let's empathise and appreciate that many people are going through challenging periods. Be more understanding if there are delays, or things don't go as smoothly as before. Be kinder, more thoughtful, more patient,"" he added.The poll also revealed that while the pandemic has gone on longer than most people anticipated, even more people are willing to follow safe management measures than they were a year ago.Almost 80 per cent of respondents felt the pandemic would have ended by now.The survey also found a high level of confidence in Singapore's handling of the outbreak, with 24 per cent strongly agreeing that the country has the pandemic under control while 53 per cent somewhat agreed. The remaining 23 per cent either indicated a neutral response or disagreed with this sentiment.But rather than being complacent, 62 per cent said they were now more likely to wear their masks properly than during the circuit breaker period.Similarly, 54 per cent were more likely to observe a 1m safe distance from others now than a year ago while 34 per cent said there was no change in their likelihood of doing this.The poll also noted that 35 per cent said they were now more likely to see a doctor for only mild symptoms while 44 per cent said there was no change in their likelihood of doing this.The notion that safe management measures are excessive and should be relaxed was rejected by 39 per cent, while 24 per cent agreed.This was in contrast to a survey conducted by ST last August, which found that 44 per cent of people were getting tired of following health measures.Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, the vice-dean (global health) and programme leader (infectious diseases) at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, pointed out that last August, there was no obvious end in sight for safe management measures.But with vaccines now being rolled out, people can more clearly see that restrictions will likely be relaxed in the near future.He added that pandemic fatigue is more likely to occur based on cultural factors, uncertainty and multiple episodes of stepping up or down of restrictions.But since the circuit breaker, Singapore has generally not experienced the need to ramp up safe management measures and instead has progressively relaxed them.""That gives most people the motivation to tolerate and adapt to existing measures for a longer period,"" said Prof Hsu.Professor Josip Car, the director of the Centre of Population Health Sciences at Nanyang Technological University's Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, called the recent survey results ""a big win for Singapore"".

He said: ""It shows that the coordinated communications around the virus and safe management measures have had a successful impact on people.""While there have been elements of public criticism, which is expected and necessary to have in good governance, those statistics reflect the understanding and cooperation of the people towards the measures laid out.""Prof Car added that people could also have seen how safe management measures helped curb the spread of the virus over the past year, which may have motivated them to want to continue observing the rules.Professor Dale Fisher from the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine's Department of Medicine agreed. ""I think there has been very responsible messaging in Singapore and a good relationship between the community and the leadership helps people understand the need to sustain efforts.""Community engagement is arguably the most important component of any outbreak response.""He called for people to still get tested even if they have mild symptoms, as this is key to determining if they have Covid-19 or another viral infection.Prof Car said it might be worth examining the concerns of the 23 per cent who did not feel Singapore has the pandemic under control.""It also shows that there are no laurels to rest on - having a pandemic 'under control' is quite different from exiting it,"" he said.""I anticipate that to be in the next step: People would be understandably looking towards a clear pandemic exit strategy for Singapore.""",True

Ask a peer, a counsellor, talk to a professional, or seek medical assistance,"" he said.Although the pandemic has affected everyone in all age groups, there has been a lot of buzz about the impact on youth .Some have had to adjust to home-based learning against the backdrop of difficult family situations, while others have had to worry about finding a job after graduation during the worst recession in Singapore since independence.Questions have been raised online about the resilience of the younger generation to cope with the crisis.But Ms Lee said that it was unfair to compare the younger generation to the older one.""Every generation have their own unique challenges and stresses in life,"" she said, pointing out, for instance, that the pandemic has resulted in a lot of things becoming digitised and youth may be better at adapting to this than the older generation.In fact, she added, this has presented an opportunity for both generations to learn from each other on how to cope.Seniors could share their own experiences thereby teaching youth that setbacks in life are common and do not necessarily mean the end, and that good things can arise from adversity.""That may lend hope and inspiration, and serve as a reminder that there can be good that comes out of failures,"" said Ms Lee.At the same time, the older generation can learn about how the young have come up with new solutions to tackle new issues generated by the pandemic, including on staying connected using technology, or on how to support one's peers with mental health issues.Dr Lee said that there were a range of signs for people to look out for to indicate if anyone may be suffering mental issues because of the pandemic.Samaritans of Singapore: 1800-221-4444National Care Hotline: 1800-202-6868Institute of Mental Health's Mental Health Helpline: 6389-2222Silver Ribbon Singapore: 6385-3714Tinkle Friend: 1800-274-4788Agency for Integrated Care Hotline: 1800-650-6060SOS Care Text service available through Facebook Messenger on the SOS official Facebook pageTheir sleep may be affected, or they may develop a host of other symptoms like palpitations, gastric discomfort, headaches. Others may feel episodes of anxiety during which they may feel breathless or as if they are going to die.Dr Lee pointed out that people did not necessarily have to experience a major crisis like getting retrenched to develop such symptoms, as different aspects of the pandemic have impacted people in different ways.If someone notices a friend or loved one with such symptoms, they should check in on them regularly, and try to help mitigate potential stressors if possible, he said.For instance, family members could help each other through financial difficulties, said Dr Lee. It was also important for people to know the various mental health resources available, so they can recommend them.Both Dr Lee and Ms Lee referred to the many good opportunities for growth and improvements in the national mental health landscape in these tough times.""Don't waste a good crisis... although it's cliche, we will pull through. But how we pull through and what we gain from this experience is very important,"" said Dr Lee.Such gains include knowing how to better relate to one's family, how to cope with difficult times, and knowing where to find mental health resources.The experts also pointed to online seminars and courses on mental health and self-care, as well as new resources and helplines that the Government, private organisations and people in the community created in response to the pandemic.These include the National Care Hotline, which provides support over the phone to individuals with Covid-19 related issues, and mindline.sg, a website that consolidates access to various Covid-19 resources.""Even after you've learned how to identify someone in distress and reach out, and link this person with help, post-Covid, these are skills that you can continue to use,"" said Dr Lee.Ms Lee added that the pandemic has also highlighted the importance of paying attention to one's own mental health as well as that of everyone else around.She said: ""I'm hoping the good that can come out of this pandemic is people being more mindful about taking care of themselves, looking out for those around them, and also being more mindful with creating a safe space, not just for ourselves but people around us as well.""",True

Almost 80 per cent said they faced ""overwhelming stress"" at least once a month or more frequently, with 28 per cent experiencing this weekly and 11 per cent daily.The results of the survey, conducted by the communications consultancy Sandpiper Communications, were released on Friday (Oct 9), ahead of World Mental Health Day on Saturday.It found that Gen Z's top source of overwhelming stress in general was family pressures, with 65 per cent of respondents citing this as a factor.This was followed by career pressures (48 per cent) and relationships with friends (41 per cent).In terms of stressors related to Covid-19, the survey found that economic and lifestyle impacts from the pandemic were perceived to have a greater influence on Gen Z's mental health and wellbeing compared with health-related impacts.Over seven in 10 said the economic fallout of the virus negatively affected their mental health, while slightly fewer - 68 per cent - said they felt negatively affected by travel bans.These concerns outranked worries about actual Covid-19 infections. About 62 per cent said they were worried about friends and family getting infected while 58 per cent were worried about getting infected themselves.Respondents were mixed on the effect of social media on their mental health, with nearly a quarter saying it had helped their mental health and wellbeing while just over a third said it had a negative influence.Out of those who said social media had a positive impact on their mental health, almost seven in 10 said this was because it helped them connect with family and friends. Two-thirds said social media was a source of distraction to pass the time and the same proportion reported increased boredom during the pandemic.Social media as a source of news was both a boon and a bane for Gen Z, according to the survey.Almost six in 10 of those who said it had a positive effect on their mental health said it was because it was their biggest source of news.At the same time, the influx of negative stories was the biggest reason for those who said social media had negatively impacted them, with 61 per cent citing it as a factor.Almost half of the group that said social media had worsened their mental health cited the lack of real connection with friends and loved ones.About 38 per cent said social media inadvertently pressured them to be constantly busy despite feeling bad about the pandemic situation.The pandemic may also have pushed respondents towards making more responsible decisions, the survey found.Asked how Covid-19 affected their future plans, 46 per cent said they would increase their focus on saving while 30 per cent said they had increased their commitments to their studies or learnt a new skill during the pandemic.The survey was conducted online in September.Ms Emma Smith, chief executive of Sandpiper Communications, said in a statement that young people are among those most impacted by the coronavirus and will need to live with the social and economic impacts for many years to come, during the prime of their lives and careers.""As we mark World Mental Health Day, it's important we understand how the pandemic is affecting them and what opportunities exist for better communication and support,"" she added.""It is concerning that despite Gen Zs suffering increased mental health and wellbeing pressures during Covid-19, they still struggle to talk about these issues.""While the increasing focus on betterment can be seen as a positive outtake from Covid-19, there's also a risk that without strong communications, openness and transparency around mental wellbeing, it may mask deeper issues.""",True

We also need to engage them and help their children to have digital literacy because we want a healthy cyberspace in the future,"" Dr Wan Rizal told reporters on the sidelines of the launch of M3 @ Jalan Besar on Sunday (Feb 7).Mr Mohamed Shah Reza, who chairs the programme, said the Covid-19 pandemic has shown that there is a gap in digital skills among seniors.""There is an opportunity to bridge the young and old... We will engage them and see how we can move forward even stronger with our digital efforts,"" he said.The programme's team also includes 25 volunteers from various professions and business sectors, as well as representatives from Mendaki, Muis and seven Jalan Besar Community Clubs' Malay Activity Executive Committees.The initiative kicked off on Sunday with a charity drive.

So when the conversation continues, the positive language we use, and the encouragement that we put in place for us to talk about mental health, will very soon cascade down to various levels of leadership.""To me, it is about listening to them, knowing what to say to them, knowing what not to say to them.

Also, as many neurodivergent students may suffer from sensory overload, allowing students to step out of the classroom whenever they need to can benefit their overall learning experience.The people around them can also make the classroom a more inclusive space through their daily actions.As a neurodivergent individual myself, I know that we may sometimes behave differently from neurotypical people.But we go to school for the same reasons as everyone else - to learn and make friends.Instead of judging us, students can learn to be patient and more accepting by talking to us and learning more about our conditions.Through clear communication, students will be able to understand their neurodivergent peers better and can better accommodate their needs.Ultimately, the classroom should be a safe space for all students.

That lasted for about two months or so.Singapore is now in the disillusionment phase, and more cases of anxiety and depression can be expected in the coming months, Dr Chee said.""We certainly entered it in March as the dorm workers' cases increased and it was becoming more obvious that our overall economic recovery was dependent not only on our ability to contain our imported and locally-transmitted cases, but how well other countries managed their outbreaks and responses too,"" she said.Singapore has now had nearly 56,000 cases of Covid-19, and 27 deaths from Covid-19 complications and 15 who tested positive but died of other causes.Dr Chee said Singapore's recovery phase - which comes right after the disillusionment phase - will get under way here when there is pandemic control and economic recovery.At the moment, this phase seems to hinge on the availability of a safe, effective and well-distributed vaccine, she said.These phases were originally described in a manual for mental health and human service workers during times of a disaster, by the Substance Abuse And Mental Health Services Administration in the United States.""Without a clear indication of when the situation will improve, the prolonged exposure to these stressors and the impact of the pandemic may take a toll on one's mental health,"" said the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) chief executive Gasper Tan.These may then lead to pronounced feelings of worthlessness and helplessness, he said.SOS started a text messaging-based service in July, some three months ahead of its planned launch, to help address some of the mental health needs in the community.Data on increased mental health cases due to the pandemic may not be available yet, but calls to help hotlines have risen.During the circuit breaker period, calls to the SOS hotline rose from 3,826 in March to 4,319 in April and 4,265 in May. The April and May figures are about 30 to 35 per cent higher than a year ago.June saw fewer calls logged - 3,831 - but this is still higher than the 2,863 calls in the same month a year ago.The National Care hotline, which was launched in April to provide emotional and psychological support to those facing difficulties during the pandemic, has already received 26,000 calls.A spokesman from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), which operates the hotline that is manned by trained volunteers, said the majority of the callers are aged above 21, and their top concerns include ""mental health, marital and family issues, emotional support needed and financial or employment worries"".Dr Goh Kah Hong, head and senior consultant of psychological medicine at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, said his department is seeing higher demand for its services.""The need stems partly from the backlog of circuit breaker measures, but there is a real increase in the number of people seeking help,"" he said.""This can perhaps be explained by the usual under-reporting of mental health issues. People are seeking help now because what they would have usually put up with has become too overwhelming to just bottle up.""Dr Goh said he expects the pandemic to have a ""long tail"" because of the ramifications of prolonged stress and social isolation.""With so much uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, it is hard to predict how long people will continue to struggle when it wraps up,"" he said.""In terms of coping with the rise in demand, we are relying on good old team work and coordination, not just within our hospital but with our community partners,"" said Dr Goh.MSF chief psychologist Vivienne Ng said that apart from some people who may experience psychological distress, there are also vulnerable groups such as those with disability, people with mental health needs, and the elderly, who may be isolated at home and require additional emotional support and access to specialised services.""Individuals with financial problems and/or who are experiencing unemployment, as well as those with caring responsibilities for young children, elderly, or individuals with special needs may also feel additional stress during this period.""She advises people to talk to friends or family if they feel distressed.""If you find yourself not able to function daily - having a poor appetite, or being unable to sleep properly, concentrate, low mood, for instance - please seek help early from a mental health practitioner,"" she said.Samaritans of Singapore: 1800-221-4444National CareHotline: 1800-202-6868Institute of Mental Health's Mental Health Helpline: 6389-2222Silver Ribbon Singapore: 6385-3714Singapore Association for Mental Health: 1800-283-7019Tinkle Friend: 1800-274-4788SOS Care Text service is available through Facebook Messenger on the SOS official Facebook page",True

Read more at str.sg/purposeMr Neo Eng Chuan, founder and principal psychologist of counselling and psychological private practice Caper Spring, adds that being confined at home can put a strain on distressed romantic or familial relationships as tension is compounded over time. People also have fewer options to help them cope, such as going to work, meeting friends or exercising, he says.And for those with mental health issues, it was a ""big blow"" when psychological treatment was omitted from a list of essential services allowed to operate under the circuit breaker, says Ms K., who juggles freelance writing and running the non-profit online publication.""Our mission has always been to let people know they are not alone, especially now when people are behind closed doors. I hope the stories will reassure people that it is okay to struggle during this time,"" she adds.Meanwhile, staff at Clarity Singapore, which also runs youth platform The Yes Initiative, have also adapted swiftly over the past few months, taking existing programmes online and even launching new ones.In April, midway through a free eight-week programme for youth with mental health conditions called Project Bloom, facilitators shifted the programme online to comply with circuit breaker measures.And in May, they moved twice-yearly in-person mental health workshops online and increased their frequency to once a month.These workshops, which previously cost $15 for an introductory session and three small-group sessions, used to see 15 to 30 people each time.

Now, the free 90-minute sessions attract between 40 and 70 participants. Sessions target those with mental health conditions - such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety and depression - as well as their caregivers.""We want to reach out to people who are hesitant about seeking help when it comes to mental health. Online, it is less intimidating as people can ask questions in the chat box and don't have to show their faces in the video,"" says intervention programmes manager Rebecca Oh.The success of venturing online has sparked new experiments, such as piloting a new programme for those suffering from skin-related mental health issues.Ms Oh explains that there is a link between conditions such as eczema and acne, and mental wellness. Sufferers may have trouble sleeping or lack the confidence to go to school.""We heard feedback that there aren't any avenues for such specialised support in Singapore and want to plug this gap,"" she says, adding that the organisation intends to run the workshop on a recurring basis.Down the line, they want to offer both online and offline programmes to continue providing accessible help to the community.Beyond the practical help they can offer, these mental health advocates agree that online platforms are a way to reduce stigma surrounding various conditions.Ms K. says: ""Sharing stories empowers the writers and lets people see them as more than their condition. This not only promotes empathy, but also bridges the gap between them and society at large.""",True

They may even see little future for themselves and their families,"" Madam Halimah said in a Facebook post on Sunday (Oct 11).Mental health issues go beyond the ""terrible pressure and pain inflicted on families"", and can carry an economic cost too, in the form of higher medical costs and higher workforce absenteeism rates, she added.The task force was announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Saturday, when he spoke at a World Health Organisation virtual event to mark World Mental Health Day.The task force was convened by the Ministry of Health and the Institute of Mental Health and it will review the psycho-social impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the population.It will also take stock of the initiatives introduced across the Government to address the impact so far and identify gaps that will need to be addressed to better meet the mental health needs of the population during this time.Its members include representatives from the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Social and Family Development, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, Health Promotion Board, Agency for Integrated Care, People's Association and the National Council of Social Service.In her Facebook post on Sunday, Madam Halimah stressed that the younger generation is growing up in a different environment and face different challenges when it comes to their mental health.""They are constantly bombarded by made-up feel-good stories on the Internet, which in comparison make their lives look so mundane and miserable,"" she said.However, she added that building mental resilience is a lifelong affair and young people must be taught how to deal with failures and to bounce back after setbacks.Samaritans of Singapore: 1800-221-4444National Care Hotline: 1800-202-6868Institute of Mental Health's Mental Health Helpline: 6389-2222Silver Ribbon Singapore: 6385-3714Tinkle Friend: 1800-274-4788Agency for Integrated Care Hotline: 1800-650-6060SOS Care Text service available through Facebook Messenger on the SOS official Facebook pageSupport at at home, in schools, workplace and in the community is crucial for recovery to take place.She urged Singaporeans to be kind and courteous in their interactions with one another.""We are all in the same boat.

This inaccurate prediction of our emotion responses is called impact bias in social psychology.One reason for this bias is that we are often unaware that our psychological defence mechanisms will automatically come into play to help us better cope with reality.Many of us picked up hobbies like music, art and gardening during the circuit breaker period. Some may argue that we did so because we were bored at home. But subconsciously, we may have taken up such hobbies to help funnel out our negative emotions.Research has also found that when we try to predict the future, we focus more on material goods rather than relationships. But social support also defines our level of life satisfaction extensively.The music video for charity song Stuck With U by Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber shows real-life clips of people all over the world cuddling, dancing and laughing with their loved ones while stuck at home. It demonstrates that life's difficulties are not that intimidating when we are surrounded by family and friends.Also, we focus too much on how our life will be different after a life crisis, but overlook how the new life will be similar to the old one.People should become aware that as human beings, we tend to overestimate the impact of a future event. We should stay optimistic, and have confidence in our ability to recover quickly from difficulties in life.Bi Yue",True
96,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/parents-and-experts-tell-of-challenges-and-silver-linings-in-raising,"Challenges, silver linings in raising newborns amid Covid-19 pandemic","Jun 28, 2021","SINGAPORE - The birth of a child is usually a time for celebration, but the Covid-19 pandemic has presented parents of newborns with a new set of challenges.A lack of social support, isolation at home and worries about hygiene are among the key concerns, said parents and experts.When Mr Bryan Tan's fourth child was born in March, he was hit by the contrast with when his first three children - now aged 11, seven and five - were born. Then his family and friends would visit often and play with his children.Mr Tan, 45, chief executive of the Centre for Fathering and the Dads for Life movement, said: ""It was harder for the rest of our family and friends to celebrate the arrival of our newborn. We missed that community involvement.""With travel restrictions in place, parents are also concerned that their children have limited bonding opportunities with overseas family and friends.Clinical psychologist Haanusia Prithivi Raj, 36, whose youngest child is three months old, said: ""I worry that my aged grandmothers who live overseas might not have a chance to meet my newborn any time soon.""Isolation during the pandemic can also make stay-at-home parents feel more alone and stressed.Ms Belle Gan, 32, who gave birth to her second child last July, said the lack of social interaction has taken a toll on her mental well-being, especially because she is left at home with a newborn child.""It's rather tiring and lonely,"" said the stay-at-home mother, who has to breastfeed her daughter every two hours.Associate Professor Helen Chen Yu, a senior consultant and head of the department of psychological medicine at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, said that when mothers are restricted to staying at home for safety, it can feel like their confinement is a never-ending one.The pandemic has also heightened parents' concerns about hygiene and safety.Events manager Derrick Sim, 31, and his wife Ruby Liang, 34, had their youngest child last June. They worried about exposing their newborn daughter to people, in case she contracted Covid-19.The couple, who also have two boys aged four and seven, avoid taking the family to places visited by those with Covid-19.Parents also find themselves more hygiene-conscious after returning home.""I'm more mindful about sanitising myself before I get close to my newborn,"" said Mr Tan.Prof Chen said mothers have expressed worries about becoming infected and what that would mean for their babies. Some have even resorted to wearing masks and gloves at home while caring for their babies, she added.But parents should also strike a balance between keeping the environment safe and not being too obsessed with cleanliness, which might take the fun out of experiencing the world for their little ones, said Prof Chen.Amid the challenges, there have also been silver linings that come with raising a newborn child during the pandemic.Work-from-home arrangements have given both parents opportunities to get more involved in raising their children together.Ms Gan said her husband now has more time to take their four-year-old son out to play while she takes care of their infant daughter. ""Before the pandemic, it was practically just me taking care of my son. And my husband would go to work and come back at night,"" she said.Separately, Mr Sim said: ""With this work-from-home arrangement, I am able to spend more time at home and be more involved in my daughter's growing-up years.""Parents have had to be more proactive in taking care of their own well-being as well.Ms Gan said that when she found herself staying at home more often, she spent more time on macrame - a type of craft that involves using knots to create textiles - as it helped her to stay calm.Remaining grateful during these challenging times has helped parents to manage their concerns.Ms Raj said: ""I am just glad that the pandemic happened in an era when we have good healthcare and we can still stay in touch with our loved ones despite the distance. That brings me solace and helps me stay hopeful about the future.""Experts offer some tips for parents of newborns to ensure they take care of themselves while caring for the baby.Something as simple as a short walk outdoors or a soothing shower can lift the spirits, said Associate Professor Helen Chen Yu, a senior consultant and head of the department of psychological medicine at KK Women's and Children's Hospital.Ms Haanusia Prithivi Raj, a senior clinical psychologist at the Institute of Mental Health's department of developmental psychiatry, said it is normal for parents to feel overwhelmed with caregiving. So, sometimes it is okay to leave the house messy and the laundry undone, she added.Mr Bryan Tan, a father of four and chief executive of the Centre for Fathering and the Dads for Life movement, said: ""It's important to be gentle on ourselves, and not feel guilty or ashamed when we let the TV become the nanny.""Ms Raj said: ""A short video call to a loved one makes a big difference to your day.""Don't be shy to ask family and friends for help, said Ms Raj. If possible, ask family members and friends to babysit or help run errands so that you can get a break, she added.Ms Raj said good communication can help new mums feel that they are getting more support and are being cared for, and that contributes to developing healthy relationships in the family.Ms Belle Gan, a mother of two, said more time together with her husband during the pandemic has helped them communicate better and align their parenting styles.It is vital to ensure that household chores are divided so that no one feels burned out, said Ms Raj.Prof Chen said fathers need to be encouraged to be supportive and participate more in taking care of the baby.A quick and easy self-check is for a person to ask himself if he has been feeling low and has lost interest or pleasure in the usual activities for much of the last two weeks, said Prof Chen.Ms Raj said: ""Do not be afraid to seek help. These mental health issues are more common than we think.""Correction note: An earlier version of this story gave Associate Professor Helen Chen Yu's title as Assistant Professor.

Mindset is a charity organisation that sources for job opportunities for recovering mental health patients.""All of us, if we're honest with ourselves, have struggled with mental health at some point in our lives even if we're not diagnosed with anything. So we hope the whole ecosystem of the workforce can be more compassionate towards those who were,"" said Mr Tan.Mr Tan also said that a lot of professionals who had struggled with mental health issues had returned successfully to their previous roles, proving that they are qualified for ""quality jobs"".""Sometimes we think entry-level jobs are the only way for them to join the workforce again,"" he said.Job Club director, Ms Joycelyn Neo, said it sent job placement officers and vocational specialists to workplaces to educate employers and follow up with clients. Awareness workshops are also conducted yearly for the human resources directors of their partner employers.IMH outpatient Abel Goh, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1998 when he was 16, is among those helped by the Job Club. The 37-year-old has been working in the F&B industry for the last four years.Mr Goh said that the club played a big role in helping find a suitable job for him, and regularly checks to see if he is coping well. He is also grateful towards his employer who has tailored his job scope and working hours to meet his needs.""Crowds make me feel very anxious. I talked to my case manager (from Job Club) who helped me explain to my employer and he was very understanding. So I can't do cashier jobs but I can still help clean the tables and take out the rubbish, and now I'm training in other areas too.""""It's not that I cannot do a job, it's just that I'm still learning,"" Mr Goh said.Correction note: This article has been edited for clarity.",True

These include students with special needs, as well as those in secondary schools and institutes of higher learning.“I'll have more time to focus on my studies and won’t have to ask my Dad for an allowance anymore,” Mr Ho said.Another $100,000 will be used to produce a play about mental wellness which the CDC hopes will strengthen mental resilience in youth and promote support networks. The play will be screened for free at schools and institutes of higher learning within the South East District.A further $80,000 will be set aside for mental wellness training and workshops to raise awareness on how people can support patients and their caregivers.Lastly, $300,000 will be used to create community attachment opportunities for youths aged 18 to 35 who may have trouble finding employment in the recession. With a monthly stipend of $1,000, they will be guided by grassroots leaders to identify problems in the community and roll out projects to solve them.Mayor of South East District Fahmi Aliman said that while Covid-19 has deeply affected employment in Singapore, there are other impacts that may not be as apparent, such as its toll on mental health or when a family cannot afford education for their children.“The Apricot Support for the Community Fund is timely and will definitely benefit many groups within the community, and South East CDC will work with our ground partners to connect them to the assistance they require,” Mr Fahmi said.",True

One time, I had an outburst after an exam paper because I felt it was so difficult and I felt my parents expectations and my own expectations were very high.""

The rooms are also equipped with a panic button for students to alert a counsellor in times of emergency.The polytechnic said that before the Covid-19 pandemic, around 20 to 30 students visited the Student Care Centre daily for a variety of reasons - financial aid queries, counselling matters, scholarships, and student support issues such as shuttle bus services, as well as to borrow assistive technology equipment.Madam Halimah also visited the polytechnic's agriculture technology laboratory during her visit on Thursday.The lab, which uses technology to optimise plant growth, is used mainly by students in its School of Applied Science. The lab also hosts Continuing Education and Training (CET) adult learners.It was launched in January last year.

""This lab provides a platform for students to gain real experience in the needs of the agritech industry. So I think in this way, RP is supporting our goal of 30 by 30 and helping to grow the industry,"" Madam Halimah said.The 30 by 30 goal is for Singapore to produce 30 per cent of its nutritional needs locally by 2030.""This is really the need of the future... The normal way of growing food is no longer going to be very sustainable in the long term, because of the tremendous use of land, energy and water.""So we need to come up with urban solutions in farming,"" added the President.
