16,'More support needed for DV victims during lockdown',"The Mayor “must do more” to protect domestic abuse victims,  after data revealed the crime figured in 10% of offences in the capital  – even before lockdown, according to a London Assembly report.There were 46,000 domestic abuse offences in the capital in 2011, but that figure surged to 89,000 last year – a 93% increase in less than a decade. The problem is particularly stark as the UK faces strict restrictions to control the spread of coronavirus. Other countries living under Covid-19 lockdown have reported increases in domestic abuse and the National Domestic Abuse helpline has had 25% more calls since the new rules came into force in Britain, according to charity Refuge.London Assembly police and crime committee chairman Unmesh Desai said the new report would “keep pressure on the Mayor” at a crucial time. He said: “With the measures taken by Government to fight Covid-19 and people being urged to stay at home, we need to ensure there are support services in place for victims of domestic abuse.”A spokesperson for Sadiq Khan said: “Other countries have seen a rise in domestic violence incidents when lockdown restriction have been put in place. “This is why the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime is urgently working with refuges and vital support services, alongside the Met Police, to support victims of domestic abuse to find safe spaces and to continue to access lifesaving support. “While we have not yet seen an increase in reports in London, we must ensure services have the support they need to support domestic abuse victims in the coming weeks and months.”",domestic abuse,BBC

BBCRefuge says there's also been a daily rise in people accessing the helpline's website, and last week that figure was up by 150%.The West Midlands Deputy Chief Constable, Louisa Rolfe, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for domestic abuse, encouraged women and men facing abuse at home during lockdown to seek help. We would always seek to remove the perpetrator because often victims in their home where family, friends and neighbours can look out for the victim are much safer than if we remove them. However we do know in certain circumstances sometimes victims need to flee their home and we will be working with refuge providers to ensure that they have access to safe accommodation.""Deputy Chief Constable Louisa RolfeWest Midlands Police",domestic abuse,BBC
19,Coronavirus: Domestic abuse calls up,"The National Domestic Abuse helpline has seen a 25% increase in calls and online requests for help since the lockdown, the charity Refuge says.It received hundreds more calls last week compared with two weeks earlier, the charity, which runs the helpline said.Campaigners have warned the restrictions could heighten domestic tensions and cut off escape routes.The charity said pressure on other services and awareness campaigns could have also led to the increase.One woman, who fled her abuser a few days ago, told the BBC life had become intolerable since the lockdown started.""Tara"", who asked the BBC not to use her real name, said she had been suffering mental and physical abuse from her partner for six months.When the lockdown began things became markedly worse.To start with the abuse was subtle: ""Isolating me from my family and friends… thinking I'm cheating on him when I'm with him all the time… just controlling.""Her abuser deleted her social media accounts and stopped her from seeing family.She says he was ""mentally abusive, verbally and obviously hitting me… recently it's obviously been getting worse, since the lockdown.""""It's been bad… I didn't care if I didn't wake up like from the night before... I just knew what was going to happen the next day, I just wanted the days to go past.""As soon as he gets up, he tries to cause an argument out of nothing, and if I fire back he'll just hit me.""Tara has now fled to a refuge in Wales, and is being supported by Llamau, a charity for young people and vulnerable women.
