1,1,1,Capitalism and Private firms during covid. Work from home is abused in India.,281.0,gsmest,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gsmest/capitalism_and_private_firms_during_covid_work/,86.0,1590757333.0,"My friend works from 8:30 to 17:30. Meanwhile every two hours his 6 yers old daughter comes and tries to tell him something. Talk with him. Show him the drawing she made. However he's on a meeting mostly. The 6 year old is unable to understand why her father is not talking with her inspite of being at home. She also thinks her father does not like her drawings. She's upset.

By week two, the 6 yr old realises that her father is working. So she comes at 17:30 sharp. However, the Private MNCs schedule a meeting at 18:30 to 20:00 so that the foreign peers are comfortable with their timings. And the meeting timings are not included in the office time.

With WFH most Indians (with laptop based work) would have thought that their travel time of about 2 to 3:hours would significantly reduce and improve their quality of life. But Private organisations think people should work 24×7 because they are at home. Forget the concept of leave during WFH. Because already you are at home. A privilege which was only given to the rich CEO. How dare you ask for leave!

This is ridiculous. Inhuman. They should understand that WFH only changes the location. Saddism at its peak.

Week 3: The 6 year old says ""Your boss is bad. Give the phone, I'll tell him to not call after 17:30"". 

Its silly that many grown-ups act like they don't understand what this 6 year old understood in 3~4 weeks. Its like ""Nobody panics when things go according to plan"".",2020.0,5.0,29.0,18:47:13,abuse,30

He had shared a video about a black man being racially profiled. While the video had some merit, the caption was misleading (they said the black guy was an FBI agent). So I shared the fact-checked version of the video to him, and he personally messaged me by calling me a Dalit killer. Since he was my childhood friend, at first I thought he was just jostling around, but then shit started getting very serious. He started abusing me and my family for the Palestinian crisis for some reason. He said I did nothing when he was racially abused in school (we studied in Kuwait) and said something about another Pakistani friend (who is my oldest friend). I contacted that friend separately and he said he was never racially abused in school. Anyways, this guy then starts abusing me for voting for Modi, which I said I didn't do. Then he abuses me for being a racist Dalit Killing Hindu, to which I said I am an atheist. Then he accuses me of falling for propaganda, to which I said I was doing the fact-checking. It seemed eerily similar to talking to a bhakt.

The guy was profiling me with the logic that since a lot of Hindus are racist, I am racist too. I kept telling him I am not even Hindu anymore, but he kept hammering that point. I told him he sounds no different from the racist people we have in India when he paints me as a racist Dalit killing fascist because other Hindus are painted that way nowadays. I told him, just because people say Muslims or Pakistanis are terrorists, obviously, all of them are not, but he keeps calling me a Dalit killer and saying that I will not eat meals with them because Hinduism is equal to racism.

Any retort of mine would just be flatly ignored, and he would just drone on and on about India deserving what it gets. I kept trying to understand where this anger is coming from since he is a good friend, but it was getting clearer to me that he has completely lost it.

He then proceeded to insult me some more and was basically quoting things that sounded like WhatsApp forwards (which his Pakistani version of Bhakts might be spreading around, I don't know). He also told me he facts checks things by talking to people on the street and not Google, and I am a murderer. By now I was sure this is not a discussion, so I wished him and his family well and said bye. He told me, he never wants to talk to me ever again and blocked me. All this started because I fact-checked his fake news.

I mean, I can clearly see this guy is disturbed and probably mentally ill, and fed a lot of propaganda, and he just needs to vent it out on someone, but man, it was an eye-opener to the fact that Pakistani folks have their own version of godi media/WhatsApp forwards which affect some people. I mean, the other Pakistani friend of mine, is completely normal. When I spoke this friend and told him about the other guy (we three were close, but those two were closer growing up) and mentioned details of the conversation, we saw a pattern where it seemed like this guy seems like he is being molded to join some ""organization"" (if you catch my drift). Apparently, over the past couple of years, he has become extremely religious. Also, the fact that he is away from Pakistan/Kuwait (basically his home), you tend to feel for the place you belong to and that adds to depressing news that is surrounding us all the time.

So, I a\[m\] 20 and my girl\[f\]riend is current almost 18. We have been in a relationship for over two years now. Her family is affluent, meaning her dad is a lawyer and she lives in a small town so it's a big deal and her uncle is settled in UK, you know, the usual. However, her family is extremely political. No one, does anything without thinking of the familial political outcome of it. Well, my girlfriend, lets call her Remy, developed BPD (clinical) from years of childhood trauma seeing her alcoholic dad fight with her mom. Her mom is the type who does everything for social validation. Remy wants to study Bsc but her mum wants has to do Btech just because her nephew is doing the same and Bsc is not considered to be a socially valid thing to do. The reason I am having to seek you lovely people's advice is because of what has been happening over the week mainly because her mum is home 24/7 now.

It all started with remy talking to her best friend (male) over phone. Lot of shit went down, including humiliating character assassination. Now remember she is someone who is going through BPD and has ran out of antideps and is neither being able to visit her doc. And just today she couldn't hold it in anymore and just burst out in front of her mum. Calling her out for not giving her a fair childhood and that sort of things.

I asked her to calm down and keep her head low till she's at least earning on her own, she listened to me and shut up.

So she teaches her baby brother in the evening, he's in upper kindergarten right now and her mum dragged this little child by his hair out of her room, that was truly traumatising.

This has been going on for so long. What options do I have to put an end to all of this? Please suggest.

**In a weird turn of events, her mom apologised and said she lost her cool that's why she did all she did. I didn't accept it as I cannot see my girlfriend being treated like that.**

11,11,11,Police officer verbally abused me when dropping my sister at her workplace who is a bank officer and is compelled to work in this corona curfew,255.0,gc2ukh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gc2ukh/police_officer_verbally_abused_me_when_dropping/,71.0,1588435734.0,"Here is the background of the incident. 

Corona virus has started spreading like wildfire in Chennai. But as you may all aware Banks are almost fully functional as per government directive. But what most of you may not be aware is that the Banks have not arranged any kind of transport assistance to it's employees. So, it has fallen upon me to pickup and drop off  my sister, who is an officer at a PSB, from and to the bank which is situated 8 KMs away from our residence.

This frequent commutation has been a nightmarish experience from day-1. On the way, we are usually stopped by police at one or two check points. Bank has provided me with a permission letter with my vehicle details. But Police have never been friendly or patient. Every single experience with the police have been very harsh. They always speak in a very arrogant and disrespectful manner. It is hard to explain them my reason for traveling, especially when driving without my sister on the way back home in the morning or on the way to bank in the evening.

Today morning, we were stopped on the way to bank, my sister displayed her ID Card to the police. The police person in white uniform said something, I couldn't hear him properly. I was wearing a mask within my helmet. He was also wearing a mask. So, I moved my bike a bit to get a little bit closer to him so that I can hear him. He immediately started shouting - ""Mutta Payale, Mutta Payale, angaye niruthuda"". It could be translated as, ""Dumb F###er, stop right there, idiot!"".

It made me so furious. But I knew I can't say anything. We explained politely that we are going to bank. He then checked my driving licence. I know if I questioned why he is being impolite, I will end up having my bike confiscated for some innovative reason. After ensuring everything was okay, he let us go and movee away from us. When I was about to start the bike, another police person in Khaki stopped and inquired us again. I had to explain the story again before he let us move.

This is not an isolated incident. Similar incidents are occuring repeatedly. Two things about this makes me outrageous.

1.) Why aren't the Banks not arranging safe commutation for its employees, especially for women employees ? Am I getting paid to go through such an ordeal every single time ? 

2.) How can police be so arrogant without any impunity ? I just can't stand this fact. Why do they have to showcase their power every single time ? Yes, I agree. We are all slaves ane have to bear silently all the harrasment done by the police. But I still can't digest the reality that Police can say or do whatever they want, and we can't do anything about that. He abused me. He didn't even say sorry. He didn't hesitate for a moment to abuse me. He didn't even feel the need to apologise. And you know what, yet I couldn't say a single word. Not a single word. If I had asked him to apologise, it would have only made the situation more worse. 

And my worst fear is that some people might tell me that ""It's no big deal"". That is, police harrasments are taken for granted. That is what making me more outrageous. This is the kind of atmosphere that allows the police abuse to flourish. This is not fair.

2. Elephants used as religious props

If any news of cow abuse got out, I’m pretty sure the country would be outraged and laws would be enacted to prevent any such behaviour. Why isn’t it the same for the Elephant which is also considered to be a holy animal to Hindus?

Is there a hierarchy of holy animals where cows sit at the top of the hierarchy and elephants at the very bottom?

Hi All, 

Sharing the story beforehand:

I am the younger son of 2 siblings to a wonderful set of parents who are in the super-senior citizen category (75 & 70 Year Old). 

My elder brother (aged 34) who is married has continuously harassed, abused and beat my parents whenever there's an argument that turns into a heated argument. His wife has never supported nor condoned his acts. I have a 2 years old video proof of him pushing my father.

Could someone suggest what legal options i have to ensure this stops? Also, as it goes with Indian parents and 'respect', my parents have strictly said no to any involvement of outside party. 

All our relatives at some point or the other have tried to talk sense into this elder brother, however it is only temporary. 

&#x200B;

I know whatever i have written might be like a haphazardly jotted down note, but my current state of mind doesn't give me the luxury to write much about whatever is happening with my parents.

Thanks",2020.0,5.0,5.0,06:20:03,abuse,75

Hi reddit.

For context, I am 20F and my cousin is 28M now. I was 15/16 when this happened and he was 24. I live in the states, but my family is really indian (culturally) so I thought I would get the best opinion here. 

I've made a post about my sexual abuse story: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dlq0s1/was_i_molested_by_my_cousin_i_dont_know_if_i_am/). I would suggest at least skimming over it but it is not necessary. Long story short, when I was 16, my cousin snuck in the room several times at times and touched me inappropriately (boobs (fondling and pinching my nipples) and my hip (I think he tried to touch my ""area"" but  I started getting more aggressive and he stopped, but he might have when I was sleeping). For those of you asking why I didn't stop him after the first time, I was scared of not being believed but I did tell him to stop several times and he wouldn't. Anyway. Recently I have been doing a lot of emotionally processing and healing, and this trauma is at the root of most of my mental health issues. I was extremely angry and resentful towards him for 4 years (rightfully so) but it took a huge toll on my mental health and didn't allow me to heal from this. I'm conflicted because he is not a ""bad"" person. Yes, he did a monstrous thing but he is not a monster and that is making this so confusing and even more difficult. Our family is very close so I've been around him A LOT these past few years, and we've had a lot of great moments together and I *almost* forgot what happened for a split second every time. I want to forgive him, especially for myself, but I don't know how to do that. Personally, I know that I need to have a conversation with him about this but I don't know how to bring this up. I don't even know if he remembers or if he will admit to it, but I think I'm prepared for both of those outcomes. My question is, is he worthy of forgiveness?

I have been a member of this community for so long and I love this community for its progressive thoughts. I wanted to get something off my chest and also ask you folks' opinion.

I have held this off inside me for too long but today want to put it out. My father is a narcissist and manipulative person. He hasn't worked in his entire life and has only done few menial jobs for very less time. My mother has struggled hard to raise me by securing a government job with her father's and brother's efforts.

However, father has been abusive and manipulative to her and she has put up with it because of Indian society, chaar log kya kahenge bla bla. I hadn't recognised this before or tried to ignore it thinking it will be ok later and also I stay away from them since I work in a faraway city and visit them once in a while.  This time due to corona effect I had to travel since I stay alone and can't cook for shit.

Today morning again he started with his bullshit about some silly reason to her and I couldn't hold any longer and got into an argument with him to defend her. The shouting match prevailed and neighbour could hear us. After this, I realized that this is not good so I sat and tried to reason with him for almost three hours and also apologised for shouting at him. But he got only defensive and never discussed his actual feeling out but instead started blaming me and my mother about everything. It's strange that he doesn't even recognize that it is her and to some extent my hard work that is putting the food on the table.

I don't know how I will continue for remaining 15-16 days like this and how to help my mother also. Any thoughts and suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading the long post.",2020.0,3.0,30.0,21:41:16,abuse,15

A guy from my college shared this in our alumni group yesterday. Just wanted to share this because I was shocked to read this and I thought others should know about this incident. And in the case anyone could help the guy it would be great too.*


**PART: 1**

This write-up is about an incident that happened yesterday with me. I was on my week-off and having lunch. Suddenly, I got a call from one of our caretakers (I work for a Property Management Firm) that few tenants and the caretaker had a fight. So, I left on the spot for the PG, where I witnessed our caretaker with bruises and swelling on her body. She claimed that 3 girls living in our PG abused her over a dispute of broken Washing Machine. Then, I received a call on the caretaker's phone and we were asked to bring the caretaker to the Police Station.

**PART: 2**

We were inside the Police Station and those three tenants were there already along with an FIR on the caretaker for physical assault and on me for demanding rent(few people think Government has ordered the landlord to not ask for rent, but if you check MHA orders it is applicable only for daily wage workers and migrant labor) during the lockdown. I tried to explain the situation to the inspector but it seemed the leverage of being a female already took over the scene and they were just trying to put everything on the caretaker while asking me to keep my mouth shut. So, to keep the proof of this discussion and how they are conducting the investigation of the case, I took my phone out and started recording it.

**PART: 3**

The next moment, I realized it was a huge mistake. The environment and the way of communicating inside the Police Station changed suddenly. First, a lady cop grabbed my phone. Then, I got 2 tight slaps from the inspector while calling me ""TERI MAA KI CH*T JYADA SHYANA BANTA HAI"". I was asked to remove my shoes, socks, bags, specs, empty my pockets, and cut my Holy Threads. They closed the doors and two cops came with two bats.
One of them came to me and asked to keep my hands in the front. Then his bat went at an angle of 150 degrees (which literally frightened the shit out of me) and in the next two seconds, it touched my palms. Then one more, then on the forearms and then on the legs. The pain of failing law inside the temple of law-keepers was hurting more than the pain of those smacks.
Then came the caretaker's turn and since she refused to put her hands forward, two MALE cops started hitting her with a bat on HER foot. I was shocked because till then I was in the dark that a male cop cannot even touch a female suspect!?

**PART: 4**

2-3 hours passed, I guess it was the time when people change shifts there. One of their senior came. So, they updated him about why we were there. The moment he heard I was making a video inside the Police Station, his exact words were ""KYON BE SUAR KI AULAD, JYADA CHARBI CHADI H TUJHE. MAA KE L*UDE"". While he was saying all this to me another cop was hitting me with my phone on head and forearm. 

**PART: 5**

For another next 2-3 hours the same situation went on, new cops kept coming and abusing and showing the bat to threaten me. Finally, they let us go around 10:00 PM but they kept both of our mobile phones. They asked me to come again tomorrow to collect my phone while I am unsure if it is in their right to confiscate my phone. How can I know they are not going to abuse my Privacy Rights under IT Act or my Human Rights. How do I know they are not going to beat me again without any actual basis.

Why am I writing this here... Although I feel disgusted with how our law keepers are manipulating the law, I still have some faith in my fellow alumni who are a part of this system. Those who are actually working inside this system to make it better for common people. I hope this story will reach to the right ears.",2020.0,5.0,30.0,04:16:10,abuse,10

I don't know what is happening to me but I am going to give my best shot at explaining everything and I am sure you'll get the jist. 
Somedays, i wake up(Never past 8, usually 7) in a good mood even though my parents taunt me right away but that doesn't affect my mood drastically, I go on with my day make some breakfast, clean my room and start with my lectures(I study and teach occasionally ; just enough so I can clear my expenses and pay for my own education.), Usually around evening I feel a sudden jolt of sadness and nothing brings me up, my head hurts, i loose my appetite completely and cry curled up in a corner of my room, i shut the room so my parents dont walk in I cry just enough wash my face with the drinking water I have and go on like nothing happened(I know not a big deal happens to everyone once in a while) but with me it's almost every other day. 
Now I know you need some background and context for this whole thing to sit right ill just give you a short summary about all aspects of my life :
Education : was a average student; but am pursuing 3 degrees right now and have completed at least 1 or 2 out of 3/4 levels in all of them, its a lot but my father made it clear how I am too old to study and if i dont do it now I can obviously not do anything later on and will work as a sweeper in his business. 

Parents : I have sibling and the relationship my parents share with me is completely the opposite with her. (So for example and I swear on my life each and everything is true : I was slapped in the middle of a wedding in front of all my relatives, had shoes thrown at my face in a fit of rage, belt and other small things just because i answered back or denied to do something, while with my sibling its the opposite as my sibling gets appreciated if she speaks back and is a rebel and the only single reason for that is because she is really good at studying, while I am genuinely glad how her life is better, I have been criticized and taunted for almost everything that comes out of my mouth) (They called my friends useless idiots the first time they came home and obviously I never asked them to repeat that ever) 
Yes, i think now that my father emotionally abuses people but as of now, i have to live in his house for a lot of reasons i can explain and a few i can't so lets leave it at that.
Back to the problem at hand, 
I cry randomly at all hours of the day
I get very silly and dark thoughts, I had saved some money to see a doctor and was diagnosed with severe depression and prescribed sleeping medication. 
The thing is I visited more doctors and did more counseling but none of it seems to work out
I have obviously tried talking to my parents but they just shut off when they hear phycological problems or mental/emotional problems. 
I tried to talk to them about being neutral in my life of at the least stop being flat out negative, tear my confidence up more but that just resulted in me sharing my problems and they using it against me in every argument for sometime after that so I obviously stopped doing that. 
I tried keeping a journal but that was snooped through so that stopped. 
I don't know why I sometimes wake up at 3 in the morning with horrible chest pain and cry and sleep after an hour. Yes i dont know why i cried while typing this message. I dont know how somedays are so okay while the rest so depressing. I am going one day at a time right now but felt like sharing everything. 
If anything triggers you please just go away because i really dont want to hear how I am ungrateful for having parents or any such bullshit.
Edit : Also : I got a few online consultations because corona and they are cheaper as well and an idiot of a doctor just threw in the word bipolar and I am scared as shit now.",2020.0,5.0,29.0,04:19:51,abuse,22

It's natural for the movement to have some criticism and strong resistance indeed. But problem arises when the extremists are hijacking the movement to promote their personal agenda like with every other movement. Social media is fuelling the rise of extremists everywhere, from politics to religion to individual movements. Extremists appeal the masses, their fiery content spreads faster than coronavirus on the social media platform. 

I am a Man and a Feminist, I believe in equality. I have worked with organisations against domestic abuse of women, I even refain from using the Nazi word to refer to the extreme feminists. But the recent #boislockerroom controversy saw posts of such extreme feminists with their generalized derogatory view about a particular gender and populist rhetoric like ""Oppressors don't deserve equality"", ""Equality for oppressors is a form of oppression"" mixed with their own personal biases and agenda. 

Now don't get me wrong here, I am not shooting down claims of these people, I absolutely have no idea what they have been though. But it's merely my observation how social media is spreading views of such extremists. Such posts tends to attract more people, it tends to create divide amongst others (When my female friends shared posts like ""Even you are responsible because you benefit from the system and you don't prevent others from enforcing it""), It helps to propagate exactly the same thing they are fighting against, Patriarchy.

I want to provide some more context to this ""very easy"" strategy. My goal is not to discourage anyone from immigrating but to provide awareness of the challenges most commonly faced by Indians that the student route to obtaining permanent residency status in Canada.

**Context**

College and university in Canada are two very different things. Colleges offer diplomas, certificates, and maybe some 3 year degrees. Universities offer 4 years degrees (BA, BSc. etc.) and Masters/PhD/Medical/Law etc. programs. In Canada colleges are popular with people already in the workforce, university graduates looking for specific skill certifications, and people looking to enter non-office jobs. Until recently most international students in Canada enrolled in universities not colleges. But recent changes have opened up a new route of enrolling is college diploma programs where upon graduation they hope to fulfill the requirement of 1 year work in Canada (any field) after which they can apply for permanent residency.

This has led to a huge increase in international students from India. Up until the early 2010s India, China, and Philippines all sent around ~30,000 immigrants to Canada a year. Now China and the Philippines remain at ~30,000 while India has shot up to ~85,000. This boom has had implications potential Indian students should be aware of which I will now discuss.

**The Trap Some Indian Students Enter**

Canada is a great country, no doubt. But when it comes to living here there are some challenges. Those challenges are...

1. Limited Job Market: it's a small country, very spread out
2. Competitive Job Market: huge number of recent immigrants + a decline in some sectors like oil means competition for any type of job even low-pay ones can be surprisingly strong
3. Expensive housing: Cities like Toronto and Vancouver are extremely expensive, small towns and cities are cheaper, but the job market is worse. Also the influx in students mean many areas surrounding colleges are now expensive due to high demand. 
4. The lack of recognition for Indian education or experience: Unfortunately Indian education is not respected here, and I've seen Indians with Masters degrees and job experience have to enroll in bachelor programs all over again. Only exception is if you've experience with a multi-national company, one that the typical Canadian will have heard of. The doctor driving a taxi stereotype is not a joke, it's extremely common.

Unfortunately many students do not fully understand the situation they are entering. So they enter the following trap.

1. Your family takes on expensive loans or sells property to send you to Canada to do your education
2. You enroll in a diploma course from a small college somewhere that has limited value and recognition
3. You graduate and enter Canada's very competitive job market and find white collar jobs are next to impossible to land, and you must settle for blue collar ones (trucking, factory, fast food, drivers and delivery men, women may also do maid/elder care jobs). An article on Canadian factories that hire only immigrants and how they're treated. https://projects.thestar.com/temp-employment-agencies/ 
4. Because your parents spent so much money to send you here you cannot just come back, but you find yourself stuck at the bottom of the ladder. Living costs are high and there may be an expectation to send money home so saving money is a challenge too.

Now of course every student comes thinking they will make it, and they will work as hard as it takes. Which is great, but most of the students trapped in what I just described thought that way too. You may also say low wage work in Canada is still better than India. Possibly, but it's definitely not an easy life when you spend every day working at multiple low wage jobs just to make ends meet. I've heard some say if they worked this intensely in India they could've probably ended up somewhere better. 

For Canadian colleges these students pay much higher tuition than domestic students so they bring in a lot of additional revenue for the country, further more Canada has fewer young people and university is becoming more popular than college. Many colleges have no been recruiting Indian students just for the higher tuition they pay, so they can survive and avoid declining enrollment.

**Backlash**

Furthermore the enormous sudden influx of Indian students has created some backlash. In small towns these students can overwhelm the local job market competing with the local working class population, and making the limited job pool even more competitive. 

In cities the students usually settle in older Indian neighborhoods home to pre-2010 immigrants and Canadian born Indians (who are called Indian-Canadians). Here too job competition increases and the result is the older Indian community has also become hostile against Indian students. Several articles in Canadian and Indian media have described the tension between Indian-Canadians and Indian students. This often combines with accusations of crime and deviancy. Here is one article: https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/douglas-todd-indo-canadians-in-uproar-over-surge-of-foreign-students/

The good news is even with this Canada is extremely friendly to Indians and things like violence against immigrants is ultra-rare.

**COVID-19**

COVID-19 has resulted in millions of jobs lost, the worst Canada has seen in 100 years. If the job market was competitive before it will be ultra-competitive for the future and international students will find themselves at the bottom of the hiring process. Here's an article: https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2020/05/08/they-hoped-for-jobs-and-to-immigrate-to-canada-for-international-students-the-pandemic-has-dimmed-that-hope.html

This situation will take at minimum 5 years to rectify, especially when you consider how many businesses have shut down permanently and how many Canadians who have never been unemployed before are now desperately looking for work.

**Advice for Potential Students**

1. **Consider a graduate program from a University**: The college route is the fastest and simplest but also leaves you with the least valuable certification. In a country where even domestic MBAs spend 2-3 years looking for a good position a business diploma from a small college no one has heard of will not impress anybody. Maybe your fine doing blue collar jobs instead of an office job, okay but remember COVID-19 created 2.5 million unemployed Canadians who you will now compete with in addition to thousands of fellow students. Doing a degree in India, from a reputed school, and then doing a Masters in Canada is the best route for securing good employment. It might take a few years but it's a better chance of success. In Canada job experience is highly valued so select Masters programs that include mandatory internships or co-op place mats. It will give you the Canadian experience that can be so hard to get for immigrants. PS. Cheating is hard in Canada, and professors have little sympathy for sob stories about how you need to pass because you can't go back to India empty handed. As more cases come to light schools are cracking down, and the press is harming the reputation of hard working students. https://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/news-story/9615483-they-passed-the-admissions-test-but-they-were-failing-in-class-how-niagara-college-tackled-an-international-student-crisis/

2. **Maybe hold off on Coming Here till a few Years After COVID-19**: The job market in India has been hit by COVID-19 sparking interest in going abroad, but recognize the job market in Canada is pretty awful right now too. No sense in dropping huge sums to end up in a foreign country unemployed, or just barely scrapping by on a low wage job with no security.

3. **Job Prep from Day 1**: Look out for any opportunities for internships, job training, certificates programs from day 1. Don't think of this as something to worry about after graduation. In many cases this can be the difference between success and failure. I've seen several Indian student spend their student years not especially focused and then spend 3 years after graduation working 14 hours a day working 3 different retail jobs.

4. **Network Outside the Indian Student Community**: The broader your network the more unique opportunities pop up. It can be a challenged, cultural barriers exist and it can be much easier to settle in a friend circle of fellow Indian students. There's also the challenge that some Canadians and Indian-Canadians look down on immigrants. But if you make an effort you will find new friends.

5. **Avoid Crime**: Goes without saying, but increasingly a few students have entered illegal sectors like drug trade our of desperation or frustration. Sooner or later this will end very badly for you, and increasingly incidents like this have resulted in some landlords refusing to rent to male Indians students in some small towns on the USA/Canada border. One example, some Indian students got into a drunk public fight over a petty issue. Someone recorded it and it went viral, police identified them and they were deported. Imagine your parents selling their land to send you to Canada and you got sent back because you got in a fight over something useless. Furthermore, such incidents have drawn negative attention to Indians and Indian neighborhoods. This may come as a surprise to many Indians who often believe their own hype and think the whole world thinks of Indians as a much of super smart hard workers. See this story on how Canada's largest Indian majority region now deals with the reputation of being a ghetto. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/brampton-a-story-of-political-importance-power-and-ethnic-enclaves/article30273820/

6. **Don't Trust Someone Just Because They're Your Community**: When you're in a foreign country it can be exciting and comforting to meet people from your state, district, caste, religion etc. But many times Indian students find themselves being cheated or abused by employers who come from their very community. So exercise caution, learn your rights, and don't put blind faith in an employer or new friend just because you've similar backgrounds. Thanks u/lovefun8in for bringing this up.

Of course this is not to say every Indian in Canada fails. There is a huge middle class community Indian community in Canada and Indian professionals are found in every field. This caution is more to avoid you making common mistakes then to say just don't come here.

I'll start by saying that I worked at the company for not more than 3 month, I had prior experience (which in the hindsight really helped me)

So when I joined, Byju was in process of mass hiring, the entire ""interview"" was a joke, just a couple of questions that they picked up online. After accepting we were called to their Bangalore Headquarters for training for a week, (Flight and Accommodation at Oyo which was paid for by the company btw). 
The ""training"" is basically where they painted a rosy picture and told us how we are not supposed to call ourselves salesmen but from now onward, we are **education counselors**.

During that period I could gather that, most of the people were freshers who came from towns and villages looking at the pay package or those from cities with poor acads, so major co's weren't hiring them because of that. I have nothing against that, but the managers know that people might be desperate enough to stick around and they made use of that knowledge.

A total of 12+ people including myself were transferred to our base city. There, we actually got to know the real picture regarding the work. That is where we were told what kind of hell we were entering into

1.  Wednesday to Friday was office time and 1 client meeting after that.
1.  Saturday and Sunday was only client meets entire day, atleast 3-4 client meets per day.


* We were supposed to call potential leads/customers during the day, say from 10am to 6pm ( Wed, Th, Fri )

* After 6 pm, we were supposed to have client meeting every single day, which would run upto atleast 9 pm, but it could go upto 11-12 am if you complete the sale, and another hour to travel home. This was basically the same schedule everyday.

* During the weekend, if you are not able to set up a client meet, or if you dont make a sale, you are supposed to come back to the office, first the manager will have a shoutfest with you in front of other managers and then you are forced to keep calling clients until the manager says its ok to leave. 

* You are supposed to get Monday **AND** Tuesday off, but even during those days, you are forced to work from home, asked to call clients from your private number, which eventually gets registered as spam. 

* Even when the company was supposed to have a holiday, they would ask us to come and work. The Bangalore HO would always get that holiday as day off day, but the sales offices were treated like step children, we could see it in our calendar but they would still ask us to come to work.

**We haven't even talked about the managers yet.**

The requirement to become a manager? As a salesman get your total sales up to 1 cr or 1.2cr or near by and you are eligible to be a manager, breeze past the interview and boom you are now a manager.
No real management training, nothing is taught. how do you expect them to not turn out like what you have seen on twitter.
After *Managers* there are *Senior Managers*, after that couple more arbitrary titles then comes the *AVP*. Which is basically all riding on the sales numbers that your team provides. that's the only requirement to climb up.

**A good salesman doesnt necessarily make a good manager**

The job of the manager/snr manager/avp is to keep shouting on those below so that they somehow make the sale. 

During my tenure, there was not a single HR person posted in my office, which is shady in itself.

* They give you a script to follow during your calls as well as during you sales meetings, you are supposed to pretend to be someone you are not (education counselor) so that the parents trust you. They even give you a card with that printed on it to look more legit. Most of the guys around, would need an actual education counselor themselves, if they were any real questions.

* If you are lucky enough to close the sale, the financial side is even worse. they use financial services that provide loans to parent which are basically loan sharks.

* Byju has 15 days return policy, after which you can not return your products, most salespeople do not mention it, as long as the sale gets reported in that weeks stats they are fine with it, even if its eventually returned, it doesnt matter.


This all is tolerated because the pay that you can earn is almost equivalent to what you get at a bschool. I have seen people, in a **single month**, picking up **1 - 1.5L in just sales commission**, thats on top of the salary (which i believe they have now reduced)

And these managers know money is why people stick around and its why they lord it over their heads, every single response is **""Company paisa de rahi hai na, chup chaap kaam karo""**

They take the top salespeople to various trips, if you complete a certain target amount of sales during stipulated time. This is the worst time to be a employee. the pressure is immense, and your manager's trip depends on your stats as well, double that, then your snr manager so triple that, then avp so quadruple that.

The kind of pressure people are put under is unbearable, the work environment is toxic. I knew that this was not right, and I never took shit from the managers, but the freshers or people who are unaware how a corporate office works used to cower in front of these so called managers, who used to abuse just like what you have heard on twitter.

65,65,88,Why do men's rights activists blame women and feminism?,33.0,gijpdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gijpdc/why_do_mens_rights_activists_blame_women_and/,64.0,1589344231.0," 

So I obsessively watched videos about the men's rights movement, TED talks, interviews and videos where the male privilege was being treated as a myth. I watched the MRA Deepika Bhardwaj give a long TED talk with various statistics about false rape cases, dowry and harassment cases etc. A documentary filmmaker named Cassie Jaye (who made the film ""The Red Pill"") claims that MRAs do not hate feminism and do not seek to discredit the women's rights movement. There were a whole of facts about how there are examples of male victimization - unfair imprisonment terms, custody battles, punishment for the same crimes, leniency at workplaces, no acknowledgement of domestic abuse against men etc.

The thing is, I completely agree with all of the above and understand that men suffer and need better legal protection. We as a society need to become more sensitive to men's issues and problems.

What I do NOT understand is, why do so many MRAs and men in general blame women and feminism for the suffering men go through? As though all the problems that men have, were directly caused by women? I did not see a single MRA actually addressing the root of the problem, which essentially is nothing but patriarchy. A system that dehumanizes men and manufactures them as macho, Uber-strong, righteous and ""mard ko dard nahi hota"" robots who can never be victims of any abuse or crime. A system that enjoys seeing women as victims and even capitalizes on it. A system, which teaches women that their ""honour"" lies in their vagina and losing their virginity is far worse than rape itself. A system that tells men that they cannot have feelings. Are men's rights activists actually going to address that? Why don't we see false rape cases in societies that have far greater gender equality?

Why don't MRAs cite statistics of violence propagated by men against men, both physical and sexual? I see physical violence around me escalate to the point of drawing blood very frequently, more often than not over trivial issues like parking or traffic. Policemen beat up criminals like mad people. Fathers beat up their sons. Little boys are being beaten and raped inside their homes by other men (their fathers, relatives or older friends generally), there is rampant rape and violence within jails and lock-ups and even highly revered institutions like the army. Men of lower social class being raped by men of upper social class. Men of lower castes being raped by men from upper castes. Heck, male teenagers bullying other vulnerable teenagers to extreme points. Sons are being tortured by their fathers, co-erced and pressured into hiding their sexuality and gender identity. Who is going to talk about all this? Are we going to blame women and feminism for this too? Where are the statistics for crimes against men by men? Or are we so hell bent on blaming women and feminism that it's just easier to turn a blind eye to everything else?

And that is one of the most ignorant statements I've ever heard. I liked the roast. It was subtle and didn't have any abusive slurs in it. Unlike Carry's loud, obscene and obnoxious ones. I may be a little biased here because I've never been a fan of Carry. I see him merely as another Shitposting YouTuber with a very huge fan following. No hate, but his content is stupid and just ""noise"" in my opinion.

I'm curious to know what the people of this thread think of it as long as y'all are respectful and make sense.

**EDIT** 
Alright, so a lot of you asked - *Why am I calling a nation of more than a billion people dumb/generalising them?*

I'm not. It was a hyperbole. It was an exaggeration because *most* dislikes on that video are either from Carry's fans (out their blind loyalty to him) or the BJP IT cell (as someone in the comments rightly pointed out) because Kamra is anti-BJP. The segment of people (like **some** of you) who genuinely think the roast was sub-standard are quite few in number. How do I know that? Go through the comment section of that video. People who can articulate their discontentment with something rarely ever do it through blatant hate. The disproportionate amount of flak the video got so quickly was something. 

And no, I don't think Carry being shitty consequently makes Kamra funny. However, _I_ found him funny, hence why I constructed my argument around how Carry's sense of humour is obscene, loud and obnoxious to _me_. You may be into both of their content, but that figure is not so large on the internet. And yes, that's unpopular, too IMO.

If your justification for not liking the roast is within **reason**, I respect that so don't take this post as an attack to your intellect. I should've made that clear in my original update. 

I would, however, take the liberty of calling Carry's fanbase immature *primarily* because they made an issue out of nothing amidst a pandemic and everything else happening in the country. (: If you didn't take part in that movement or tried to justify the contents of his video - don't take it^this as an attack to your intellect either. 

I made this post to understand what the poeple of Reddit thought of it because the comment section of that video is a shitshow. I still think it's a non-issue and shouldn't have gotten the amount of attention it did. The fact that _it did, infact, get copious amounts of attention_ didn't settle well with me.

As i am growing up, i am realizing i should express myself more, i should accept what is wrong is happening around me.

This started since the very beginning of my school, I was a bright student good in studies, topper of class. My family is typical indian orthodox muslim type. Things were going good until I reached 6th std. Because of dominant and self centered nature of my father, who never spent time with me in my childhood, (even though, he didn't had that much work) and always brags about saving money, money is evrything, money and money only, I understand he has seen a different side of life, and he was a from a pretty poor family where there no such things as ""opinion"" or ""liberal"" views existed. Not to mention, I cannot go against his views, he is always right in everything, I cannot say a word against his views, whatever he decides for me is final, if i rebel, he would turn voilent, and break things around, make a wreck -o- shit atmoshpere around house. My elder brother, who is a big hypocrite, always stands by my fathers side, no matter what, and my mother, who outright favours my elder brother over me (she even accepted it). There was once incident were we went outside to buy some clothes, and in some store we were choosing some clothes, and co-incidently, me and my brother chose the same shirt, but to my surprise, they snatched that from me, and gave it too him saying ""you are younger, you don't need this now"" is that really an excuse? And this is just one incident of 1000s. They favour him for everything, there typical mentality is that ""the older one should be the first priority"". Coming back to my dad, he thinks parents have done some kind of favour to kids by raising and feeding them, so I owe everything to him, I should not spend my own money however I want, I never bought anything without taking his permission, even for stupid things like toothbrush, and this will surprise you, that I am 21 now. I made my way through, I made all my documents, from driving license to pancard, he didn't helped me out in anything. His problems are problems, and mines are just childish.

He has cardiac heart disease, millions times I have told him he should stop smoking, but he shuts me up by saying ""I smoke with my money"". And the other moment if he gets any stroke or hard breathing problems, than I should look after him, or else I am a spoilt kid. 

Whenever there is an argument between him and me, the talk always heats up and turns voilent then my hypocrite bro and mum always bashes on me for argument.

The thing is, my parents always wants to know where I am going, who I am talking to, I never stayed out of the house for more than 5 hours, I never night outed, I never smoked, drinked, partied (even though, I am happy about this decision). I work in a pretty decent company, but the payout is low, cause I am a fresher. And I cannot even think, about moving out, that will only lead to another emotional black mail, verbal abuse. And also I am not financialy ready yet.

List is endless, I cannot tell you how orthodoxic and hypocrisy I face everyday, The taunts for no reason, the verbal abuses everyday.

Last but not the least, I am typing this from my moms phone, I lost my phone in an accident, its been 7 months I dont have a phone, because my dad will decide when and how and which phone I will buy.

Sorry for extremely long post, but I wanted to express.

### Tl;dr

Resident Welfare Associations ('RWAs') have nominated themselves as the first line of defence against the coronavirus pandemic. Media reports suggest that RWAs are going well beyond the guidelines issued by the government and mandating use of Aarogya Setu by residents and visitors including domestic workers, drivers, delivery personnel and other service providers. Such measures may be well intentioned but they are illegal because the bottom line is that RWAs are private self-administration bodies which lack the power to issue rules restricting the freedom of movement and right to livelihood of individuals.

Media reports indicate that Resident Welfare Associations (‘RWAs’) in several cities have made use of the Aarogya Setu mobile app a precondition for residents and visitors such as domestic workers, drivers, delivery persons, service providers etc. As you may know, Aarogya Setu is a COVID-19 surveillance app launched by the Indian government which has been heavily criticized for privacy, security and exclusion related concerns.  IFF has opposed mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu on the[ **litigation**](https://internetfreedom.in/kerala-hc-hears-challenges-against-mandatory-imposition-of-aarogya-setu/),[ **policy**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-studied-the-protocol-and-no-this-doesnt-sufficiently-protect-your-privacy/),[ **RTI**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-through-the-right-to-information-lens/) and[ **public advocacy**](https://internetfreedom.in/45-organizations-and-105-prominent-individuals-push-back-against-the-coercion-of-aarogya-setu/)fronts. But before we delve into the legality of rules made by RWAs which mandate use of Aarogya Setu, let us first understand what is the legal status of RWAs themselves. 

A Resident Welfare Association is a voluntary body formed by the residents for the residents. It is a self-financed and self- managed association registered under the Society Registration Act, 1860 (subject to state-level amendments). The primary purpose of such an association is to represent the interests of residents of a specific locality/complex and perform the following illustrative functions:

* Represent the residents before the governmental authorities;
* Collect money for maintenance of common areas;
* Establish good public infrastructure for the residents;
* Organize workshops and cultural functions etc.

The government may also issue guidelines to RWAs as seen in the context of the [**Bhagidari Scheme**](http://www.rwabhagidari.com/registerRWA.htm) in Delhi, which aims to promote broad-based civic participation in local governance. The formation of an RWA has also been made mandatory under Section 19(9) of the Real estate (Regulations & Development) Act, 2016.

RWAs are governed by their Memorandum of Association (MoA)/ by laws which contain their objectives and functions. While the by-laws are binding amongst the residents, they lack statutory character and do not have the force of law as [**clarified**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1900075/) by the Bombay High Court. For similar reasons, RWAs cannot issue directions prohibiting residents from keeping pet animals in violation of [**guidelines**](http://www.awbi.org/awbi-pdf/pet_dog_circular_26_2_2015.pdf) issued by the Animal Welfare Board of India under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.

### RWAs turn mini-sovereigns during COVID 19

The role of RWAs during the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial to ensure that residents and visitors are adhering to government guidelines relating to wearing masks and maintaining physical distance in common areas. RWAs are also responsible for maintaining sanitation of common areas and facilitating supply of essential commodities in their locality. Recognizing the importance of RWAs as stakeholders, the National Centre for Disease Control has issued an [**advisory for RWAs**](https://ncdc.gov.in/WriteReadData/l892s/3931246121585916767.pdf) to support and complement governmental efforts to contain spread of the virus. 

However, RWAs are slowly morphing from private self-administration bodies to mini-sovereigns in their own right. Several RWAs have taken it upon themselves to impose restrictions which as this [**news report**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/lockdown-is-easing-but-many-rwas-seem-not-to-have-noticed/) notes, *‘‘make even the stringent terms of the lockdown pale in comparison.”* For example, an RWA in [**Gurugram**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/gurugram-rwa-insists-on-covid-report/articleshow/75837887.cms) has asked its residents to have their domestic help tested for COVID-19 before they can be allowed into the premises. This is clearly inconsistent with testing guidelines framed by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) - the only competent authority for frame guidelines for COVID-19 testing. In another instance in [**Noida**](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/apr/24/denied-medicine-for-parents-claims-noida-man-as-society-seeks-aarogya-setu-2134781.html), permission to enter a housing complex will be granted only if the entrant has a ‘green’ status on the Aarogya Setu app.  


The most recent [**order**](https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/MHAOrderDt_30052020.pdf) issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on 30 May 2020 states that use of Aarogya Setu should be encouraged by employers on a “best efforts” basis and district authorities may “advise” individuals to install the app. The terminology used in these guidelines makes it abundantly clear that RWAs have not been authorized by the government to mandate use of Aarogya Setu among residents and visitors, and they do not have any authority to prohibit entry to residential colonies on this ground.  


As we have explained earlier, COVID-19 surveillance apps are susceptible to false positives and false negatives because of inherent limitations of bluetooth technology which is not a perfect proxy for virus exposure. If RWAs were allowed to force residents and visitors to download the Aarogya Setu app and allow entry based on the status displayed on the app, it could lead to wrongful confinement of certain residents and deprivation of livelihood of working class service providers. Residents who are shown by the app to be at risk of COVID-19 could be prohibited from leaving their house or accessing common areas. Further, domestic workers, drivers, delivery persons and other service providers could also be prohibited from entering the colony to do their jobs based on their status on the app.

### What can an ordinary resident do?

If you find yourself in a situation with an overzealous RWA, first ask them for a copy of the by-laws and the rules and details of the procedure by which they were adopted. The RWA’s MoA and by-laws will contain the procedure for amending existing rules or adding new rules. Generally, new rules or amendments cannot be made without a General Body Meeting. If the rule making procedure has been flouted, the rules will be invalid.

We also encourage you to have a constructive dialogue with your RWA representatives highlighting concerns about accuracy and privacy of the Aarogya Setu app and explain that official MHA guidelines do not authorize RWAs to require mandatory use of Aarogya Setu. Any rules which are inconsistent with governmental guidelines may be an abuse of power by the RWA and can be challenged in court. Any resident who is aggrieved by  arbitrary and unreasonable actions of an RWA can file a suit under Section 6 of the Societies Registration Act, 1860. The RWA can be sued in the local civil court in the name of the President or Secretary.

### Representation to Government

We recognize that individual residents and working class service providers may not always have the bargaining power to negotiate with RWAs or approach courts. Therefore, we have written to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, the National Real Estate Development Council and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare seeking issuance of an advisory which clarifies that use of the Aarogya Setu mobile app cannot be made a precondition for entering residential colonies.

As researchers at the Centre for Internet and Society note in their [**recent article**](https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/essay-watching-corona-or-neighbours-introducing-2018lateral-surveillance2019-during-covid201919) on lateral surveillance, the COVID-19 pandemic has witnessed an increase in surveillance by private actors. Residential colonies cannot be controlled by RWAs as mini-sovereigns, and insofar as RWAs impose measures which are inconsistent with guidelines issued by the government, it amounts to vigilantism. During the COVID-19 crisis, the need of the hour is social solidarity and the government has a positive duty to prevent RWAs from engaging in intrusive and arbitrary practices which lack any basis in law and promote a culture of suspicion, stigma and exclusion.

Just finished “Paatal Lok” on Amazon Prime, and I can’t get it out of my head. This post has spoilers, so if you haven’t seen it,  stop reading here.

In one scene DCP Bhagat says that “What we call system is not garbage but a well-oiled machinery. If you resist it, you will be easily replaced”. According to me, this quote sums up the entire series for me.

Be it the lead Hathiram Chaudhary , Ansari or even Tyagi , we all are merely the small parts in the whole system where each of us , be it good or bad,  just playing our role. While much has written about excellent performances in this series, my aim through this post is to appreciate how real it seems when you start relating it with the news we read about every day from gang-rapes of young dalit women to arrest of gullible criminals. Is it the truth which we read everyday or we are just reading someone’s version, which may be fabricated to suit his/her agenda. It is disturbing to find out that we may never know the backstory of the person. 

It made me question my own notions about morality and what is a crime and what isn’t. For example, when Tope Singh takes a stand against the Upper-caste abusers in his village, is he a criminal or a just a common man who has decided not to take it anymore and resist.

Another interesting character arc for me was Hathiram Cahudhary, who is a meek police officer who has accepted himself as a loser but in the end becomes a confident , risk taking  person who decides to go against everyone in power who are at the top rung of so-called system.

But my favourite character in this series was Ansari. His attitude of being the right guy even after facing discrimination everyday because he is a Muslim, will forever inspire me. To sum up, in the world of Sanjeev Mehras, always try to be Ansari.

TLDR Edit: Its not for the faint of heart. Plus talk of it being leftist seems like the murmurings of snowflakes.

So I thought I'd find out what all the hulabaloo around this show is about. I'm a big Vipin Sharma fan so when I saw his name in the cast, I decided I was going to watch it. 

I did read that this is supposed to be neo noir, but I dont think I'm getting a neo noir feel. Feels more like a true crime series.

So. Is it good?

Yes. The pace is good. And the plot is interesting. The actors do a good job for the most part. The sets are frikkin perfect. It feels like they've shot all the scenes in actual locations rather than in studios. The attention to detail therein is also frikkin perfect.

The dialog is excellent. I dont usually enjoy swearing for the heck of it, but the swearing is so natural and so authentic at times, that the realism makes me burst out laughing. 

There are some failings tho, not unique to the show. All the actors seem to slip into polished english every now and again. The local accents are faulty too. This is the result of hiring talent from a very narrow pool IMO and its a grudge I have against the industry in toto. 

That said, the parallel threads are interesting. I enjoy police procedurals a lot which is why I often wish the show would switch back to following the police thread and leave out the others, but I understand thats just me. I'm not quite sure if I like the earnestness of the would be victim, i.e. the Journo, it doesnt seem very convincing, but its not because the actor lacks skill. I think they script is weak here. Plus the lady he's having an affair with, her character hasnt been developed at all. There seem to be no meaty roles for women in this series yet. I doubt it but maybe that will improve later.

Also I think Ansari is going to die. The goody-two-shoes character always dies, na? 

Do I recommend it? Yes! The first two episodes I'd rate very high. Possibly 8/10.

Edit: I havent noticed any leftist politics in this yet tbh.

Edit: Half way into the fourth episode now and I'llbe honest. This is difficult to watch. I take back my recommendation in part. Not because of any lack in quality, but because it is brutal - visually as well as mentally.

As for the politics. I think there are those that fear any mention of caste, queerness or discrimination in any context. The fear even mentioning things let alone speaking about justice or a progressive take on this. Those people are the ones calling this leftist in nature. I'll revisit this side of things once I watch it completely, but I'm pretty sure I'm on target here. 

The lack of intellectual caliber in the right is exasperating.

Edit: Two more episodes down and I am absolutely astounded by the balls this show has. Its covered so many taboo subjects. Domestic Violence? Check. Child Abuse? Check. Sexual abuse of children? Check. Plight of the homeless? Check. Discrimination of Muslims? Check. Hindu Terrorism? Check. Fake charges of terrorist? Check. Caste discrimination? Check. Caste based violence? Check. Rape use as a tool of caste based violence? Check. I am frikkin blown away. 

I have to revisit the charge of leftist narrative here and I think I cant understand it now. The right wing mind must be totally overloaded by depictions of the marginalized. And thats probably overheating it as well.

Final Edit: Just finished watching. The show is excellent. Propaganda is absent. If anything it pokes fun of us, the middle class, it pokes fun of us regularly and is kinda self aware tbh. To reiterate about the leftist narrative >!The ""leftist"" journalist turns from bring one of the protagonists to being an antagonist!< Its frikkin good man.

Final Edit +1: I understand that a lot of people are disappointed with the treatment of the character named Cheeni. I understand what it feels to have little or no representation in tv and film or have a negative one when it does happen. I think their complaints should be heard and the industry learn from this. 

Secondly, I real that some people think hindus have been unfairly portrayed in this series. It seems to be that hindus make up both the antagonists and the protagonists almost equally. You have characters that are negative as well as positive. I dont think their claims hold any weight.

Absolute final edit: read a leftist criticism of the series from someone actually knowledgeable on the subject - [Regressive Depiction of Caste & Bad Politics in ‘Paatal Lok’](https://www.thequint.com/entertainment/hot-on-web/regressive-depiction-of-caste-and-bad-politics-in-pataal-lok)",2020.0,5.0,26.0,03:11:55,abuse,10

I am so happy to see it being discussed healthily among indian community, bringing up issues which are normalized and forgotten. Often, I see posts and opinions, where a person agree that casteism/colorism is indeed a problem but it is not as bad as racism. I personally find discrimination in India is worse than racism around the world. I am happy to be corrected and told off, but please explain how following situations doesn't make you think discrimination in India is worse than racism in western world.

1. People who belong to low income, lower caste, certain religions are treated and respected differently. They are essentially second class citizens who have no voice and can't stand up for their basic human rights. They are not trusted and often discriminated in society.

how many of you let your kids play with someone from lower caste?

Let say you know this child of your domestic worker for many years. Would you hug, talk, treat, give advice in same way as you would to your nephew/niece or friend's child?

Would you let child of domestic worker/lower caste to have sleepover with your child?

Would you be completely ok if those kids date yours and marry them?

In south where I grew up, I was told to respect elders. There are respect words which is part of every sentence. I was also told that I can call domestic workers by their names and don't have to give them same respect. I find that unnatural. If this is not racism, then what is?

I have seen when someone is darker, people gossip behind their back as how they look like some one from lower caste and would amount for no good in life. I find innate racism in this implying that they are expected to be discriminated in all walks of life.

It is not long ago, that these people are considered dirty, dishonest and responsible for all crimes in the society. They are not allowed inside house, to share same utensiles, to enter temples, share food. All these still exists in some form around the country. For example, you can google for how someone got killed because they ate food in front of upper caste person and you are bound to find some recent news article. I find this worst form of racism.

2.  Most people do agree these problem exists with favoring lighter skin. But they don't think itshould be given priority like in USA, because darker skin people in India don't have to fear for their life. I disagree with this.

Darker skin people in India are perceived to be the only ones who rapes, steals and distupts society. They are more likely be arrestted and ill treated. If they have to choose between someone who is darker and lighter in bus for long ride, people choose lighter skin people. This can again look harmless on surface, but in grand scheme of things, they do feel less human and constant need to prove their innocence.

When cops have to choose someone to beat up in protest or lockdown, who do they choose? If you see those videos, you can see they target certain group of people in society and bystanders/viwers agreeing that those are indeed problemetic people, so they deserve it. Darker, poor teens are often seen taking responsibility of crimes because they don't want to be beaten to death. They do get killed sometimes in these chaos but easily forgotten and not talked about. How can you  be aware of this plight and still say it doesn't cause fear for  life in India?

Women from these communities are more prone to sexual violence, molestation and physical abuse. They are perceived to be easy targets because they don't have means to report or fight it, so often it goes unnoticed. Abuse/discrimination against women is bigger issue on its own, but it happens more to darker woman.

I outright hate that the original purpose for which the Bajrang Dal was created has been twisted by stupid assholes an has been converted into a large group of bullies. People around me are boycotting muslims because one idiot uploaded a video on TikTok which show him licking fruits to spread Covid-19. We too have racism, North Indian vs South Indian.

The education system here is a prank. Child abuse is taken as a joke; we have democracy at the centre but authoritarian parenting a home, children are being beaten like cattle in the name of discipline, wives harassed too. Parents force children to marry a girl of their choice. Indians do not know what privacy means, poke their noses where it doesn't belong and keep forcing themselves on others. It's ironic that violence is so widespread in the nation of Mahatma Gandhi. The concept of mental well-being is non-exisent. Depression and ADHD are considered cries for attention. People undergoing psychotherapy are labelled mad. Girls are blamed for being raped. Rape is rampant, child molestation more so while marital rape is justified by the society.

On the other hand, too much legal power is on the side of women. Prenups ae not valid costing unjustified amounts of possessions to husbands. False accusations of rape and dowry are destroying people. Reservation system has long since served it's purpose but it's still continuing unfairly because every politician is afraid to raise this issue.

I have a family member who is so fucking passive aggressive it has drove me crazy over the years without even realising what is happening because i wasnt able to put my finger on this word ""passive aggressive"". I finally realised how he is passive aggressive to a extent he will ruin anything for you before you even begin it if it means he wont be able to enjoy it or it will lead to him having less control on you. 

I live in his house so I do not have the option of leaving, but YEARS AND YEARS of this abuse while putting a lovely front has left me with TONS of issues. 

I have been slapped between marriage halls, slapped  or punched at relatives places for getting food on my clothes, slapped and threw my phone away because he ""caught"" me talking to friend late at night. 

I have no privacy. I wrote down a few feelings in a diary and went to pee and came back to him and his spouse waiting for me with the page of the diary open. 
I have had shoes thrown at me, hit with belts till they broke and what not. 

I swear this is not the worst part, the amount of PRESSURE i have towards my future made me want to do something to myself several times for a few moments of peace before I go gentle into that good night. 

There have been times when i felt like the best way to make them hurt was to do something to myself and I smiled for I knew how much grief and pain it would cause them. Trust me I am not being selfish. I have endured 1000times more bullshit and abuse then i have let on here. Its usually always emotional now because I am not longer a small boy who would easily succumb. 

I have sneaked into his phone and found so many incriminating shit that I could destroy his marriage. 
But a few days ago something happened and I finally saw everything for what it was and promised myself that I will get the DUCK out of here as soon as I can. 
I am studying for 3 very well respected and professional degrees and the moment i get a chance i will fuck off. 

Faqs - No one in my family came to my aid 
-At first they took his side later on They didn't interfere. 
- No i am not suicidal or anything so please dont even start. 
- If you are going to say or even hint if I am selfish please just get lost. 
I am posting this because I have so much pent up hurt, rage, and sadness with a hint of loneliness in me that letting it out felt like a good option.

Using a throwaway in case.

I am writing this as a frustrated individual, and looking for some sane advice.

For the backdrop, I got married 3 months ago, was an arranged marriage, I had known the girl for 7_8 months prior to the marriage.

She was sweet, caring, and we used to talk frequently after both sides had said yes. I found nothing really wrong with her behavior in that time.

Fast forward to after the marriage, and life has become hell pretty much, due to her thought process or whatever you might call it being completely messed up. I have good reason to now believe her to be controlling,  manipulative and a gaslighter.

A few points to illustrate :

1. She doesn't seem to care for me at all, anything I ask of her , she says no or doesn't pay attention at all. Whereas she is always asking small small things to be done by me.

2. She dislikes my parents, especially mom because she is a housewife and spends a higher amount of time in the kitchen than what my wife thinks is required. Shes actually called my mom an idiot in front of me for doing this.

3. Shes never interested in physical intimacy, always having some or the other reason to withhold sex, either it's her being tired or her periods being 4-5 days away (like wtf? ) ,most of the time she won't even talk to me unless she needs something or wants me to pay for something.

4. She spends most of her day on mobile or laptop, pretending to study online courses to help in her career, but mostly fails to clear assignments which are really simple, and again only calls me cause she needs help with them.

5. Hates my brother cause hes the pampered child and my parents are fools for spoiling him ( he isn't that spoilt )

6. Slaps me many times, pretending to be playful but I find it to be demeaning. Doesn't listen to my request to not do it.

7. Threats to kill herself if I ever talk to my parents about things.

8. Always me spending money, even though she has some herself aswell. Any gifts to send to anyone always are bought by me.

9. The rants, my god those rants, on days whenever some incident happens, like my mom being unwell or whatever. She will rant for hours before bedtime, and then blame her or me for keeping her up late ( wtf again )

There have been a lot more incidents like these...

I don't know why it came to this, i know that you guys are only hearing my side of the story, but I have only tried to be a caring husband, fulfill my wife's needs and only expected a bit of care and closeness in return. No idea what I should do, and these things have been weighing heavy on my mind past so many days.",2020.0,5.0,27.0,01:54:14,abuse,

Tl;dr at the bottom, but I request you to read the whole thing.

Hey everyone, this is a situation regarding my neighbour. She is 24 years old, has a 7 month old baby and she is also 4 months pregnant. She is not very intelligent and blindly trusts anyone. She met a guy 4 years ago through sms, classic fraud love story, and left everyone to be with him. She saw the guy for the first time when she arrived at the station. He was a 50 something dude, she regretted for a bit but had no choice and stayed with him, she feared returning would be fatal.

They married in a temple, the guy tore the documents, anything which would show their marriage as legitimate. She didn't stop, because she trusted him. He was usual abusive, he beat her and emotionally played her every time. Sometimes later she discovered that he has 2 other wives as well. So this guy would jump between wives, abuse them, leave them, stay with another and go back when he felt like it.

He moved this girl to a new place, adjacent to my apartment, we saw him beat her once, obviously intervened. Few days later the guy disappears. This girl thought he was kidnapped by his ex wife who allegedly threatened him to do so. The guy is also a lowly criminal, steals and sells the stolen stuff (yeah I live in a dump actually). Anyway later our suspicions were right, he dumped her.

He didn't leave her any money, when she called the society for help, they actually turner against her and wanted to evict her, they are waiting for the end of lockdown to do that. She tried police, they asked for money and threatened to arrest her instead, called her really inappropriate things. NCW also denied help, we tried local foundation and ngo, no one is willing to help and blaming her.

We even asked the girl to try and put the baby for adoption, she doesn't agree, can't blame her for that. But the baby drinks packaged milk, which we are providing right now. We have tried everything, I am broke as well or I would have helped her financially for sometime, but I quit my job at a very bad time.

So basically she is proper f**d if I put it bluntly, given time she can get back on her feet, but I'm more concerned about the baby, as she is very distraught, doesn't eat for few days, we actually force her. There's only so much anyone can bear before snapping. I am concerned that she might take her life if things don't work out.

When she pleaded with the guy for help you know what he said, ""that's your matter"". I've never wanted to hurt someone so bad before. So now we might have 5 days left before the lockdown ends, and people here will evict her for sure, forgot to mention that her rent is due as well. Is there anyway to help her get some shelter or some work? I've called so many places and they all turned out to be useless, if the police won't help, who would? And to be honest I've completely lost faith in humanity.

I was contacted by M/s Shaha Finlease Pvt. Ltd. (Company) having its registered office at Mumbai several times on account of a credit card amount of Rs. 25 lakhs (and this is appearing in CIBIL report as well) appearing in the name of a person whose name is closely similar to mine and who is at Hyderabad (mentioned in the email sent to me on various dates). The Company falsely claims that I had approached M/s Standard Chartered Bank (hereinafter referred as SCB) with a request for availing credit card facility(s) and executed a personal guarantee in favour of SCB. They have come with frivolous claims of the credit card facility being used by me with utter malafide intention neglected to repay the same on due dates. 

It has also been informed vide abovementioned emails that SCB vide a Deed of Assignment dated 09 February 2010, inter alia, assigned, sold, transferred and released the entire debt payable by this person under above mentioned Credit Card Facility along with security interest and underlying-security therein in favour of the Company.

Since June 2018, the Company has been repeatedly calling and sending emails and threats (a copy of call log from different numbers and emails are attached). I have time and again explained to them that there is perhaps a mistake in the identity as the names sound very similar. Through one of the calls, I was also told that there is a similarity in the date of birth. However, all other details such as father’s name, etc were different. Though I clarified that I had taken a credit card from SCB and used it during the years 1999 to around 2002 (the account was closed thereafter with all dues paid and the credit card returned), I have not taken any other credit card facility from SCB however, the calls continued. Further, I have never stayed at Hyderabad and the addressee in the email is not me. It is merely due to this similarity in the name.

Over the last couple of months, the harassment and threats became more frequent. On 6 March 2020, an advocate asked me questions on the same and told me to reach out to CIBIL. He does not seem to be associated with CIBIL or this company since his email id had @sc.com which goes to Standard Chartered. On 30 May 2020, I was told by my postman that someone was trying to reach out to my phone and was not able to connect. Hearing this, I took the number from the postman and dialed the same. To my surprise, I was told that the person speaking to me was from the Chennai branch of the Enforcement Directorate. He also threatened me saying that the ED is going to continue investigation in the case and harassed me while calling me names and abusing me on phone asking me to pay the credit card amount. . 

On general online search about the company, it looks like the Company routinely engages in this kind of behaviour and harasses people to pay debts they do not owe. There are multiple consumer complaints filed against them. 

While we have raised a dispute with CIBIL on these entries, (and even wrote to the Bank through the Ombudsman), is there something we could do? If this goes on for longer then I might as well file a complaint in the consumer forum. 

Thanks for reading!

My father is the longest tenured and senior-most economics professor in my state. He isnt very liked because of his shitty attitude [and he is abusive and tried to kill me and mom, said it various times here in my previous 2 accounts] but his craft is well respected by his peers.

When he for his MA Economics from Kalyani University with GOLD medal in 1981, he was also an upcoming CPM youth leader groomed to be a future party head. He was fairly connected and got an opportunity at a scholarship from Harvard University for his PHD.

All he had to do was somehow get rs 50000 in 80's rupees and go to the Interview where he was probably gonna get accepted. He was that good. And my Grandpa was a big gazetted officer for WB govt.

But he couldnt get the money from his father. They didnt have that much even with good govt salary. Raising 6 children took a lot.

My dad even with his Gold medal and connections couldnt get a loan from ANY bank to go to America. He missed the scholarship and joined the college where he still remains. 

He still talks about it to this day. I think thats part of a reason why he's so angry and abusive. he could have achieved even greater things in life but couldnt because of money.

I ask because although I’m 30 years old and my high school years are a thousand years behind me, I’ve always believed that part of the reason I used to get picked on and bullied by my peers in my teens so much is because they noticed how much certain teachers would pick on me and since children are impressionable, they thought it was ok to do the same. I think teachers saw me as an 'easy target' and got some of rush out of bullying me.

Children follow by example. If adults bully, children will do the same.

There have been so many instances of teachers simply acting unprofessional and mentally unstable when there is no reason to. Don’t get me wrong; I’m all for discipline but beating students up like you are training for a Rambo movie, verbally abusing a student like you’re some kinda raging alcoholic trying to win a screaming contest in a bar fight (you get the picture), mentally harassing a student because your husband hits on your student’s family friend’s older daughter at a mutual social gathering (yeah, that actually happened with me)....are all unacceptable :-| :-| :-|

They also mention that they are not minor and they do some job but they do not know what to do and so they want a solution to their situation. When they are suggested to leave such horrible parents, they make excuses that their father is sick or his brother is too young or he cannot go against his parent's wishes because he does not earn enough. 

I do not understand the mindset of these young Indian men. Do they lack a spine? Do they lack balls?  Why don't they dump their parents? Why don't they act like adults? Why do they remain subservient to their emotionally blackmailing, abusive parents? Why don't they want to be independent? Why don't they value freedom above everything?

Everyone you think is bad is just a victim. A Terrorist is a victim because what he does is what he is taught from child's age. A greedy banker is a victim because he never had enough money growing up. An abusive mother is a victim because she was abused growing up. They just pass along the ugliness they recieved. 

An example : A man beats his wife child because he is abused by his boss, because the boss was going through a divorce, which was the result of the boss's wife's adultery... And it goes on forever.

Here's an exercise : Pick out the worst person you know and then think why you think he is the worst, I can guarantee this, if you think about it long enough, without emotional bias, you will arrive at a reason that is completely understandable.

I have been told I have a way a with words, so here is a beautiful analogy.

You only encounter the perils of the path when you wish to make the journey to the peak. There is no point in blaming and ranting about the swamp, streams, insects and rock, along the way, or worse, act compulsively and hurt not only yourself but also the rock, and in the process setup a beaten path to those behind you. The way of the intellect would be to deal with them as methodically and efficiently as possible and continue the journey.. The other way would be the way of the yogi, You derive contentment without making the trip at all.

There is no Right and wrong, Good people and bad people, only victims amd winners.

If you are have a sufficient amount of knowledge and understanding, every emotion you recieve, be it anger, deceit, jealousy etc if refined thoroughly, it WILL turn into empathy, empathy for their ignorance. You are the winner if you can do this. 

Emotion is just an energy, the two properties of energy is that it can be transferred or transformed. Transfer it, you are a victim, transform it and you are the winner.

The goal of life is happiness and the root of happiness is knowledge. 

There is no difference between a Soldier and a Terrorist other than their method of being happy.

A soldier gets happiness in killing terrorists.
A Terrorists gets happiness in killing soldiers.

Both are just victims of incomplete knowledge.
Both spread happiness on their side, and misery on the other.
Both suffer from trauma and Both are unhappy in the end.

Do whatever you want to do, kill, steal, hurt, just make sure what you are doing has its foundation made of complete knowledge and think, if there can be anything else you can do that will make you happier, and then act.

I've seen this community being supportive of each other. Figured I could use some advice and help. This is gonna be a long post as I'm pouring my heart out.

I fucked up. Big time.

I'm just one of your regular guys; 26 years old, techie, etc etc.; from south India, from a fairly conservative family. They've been extremely supportive my whole life, and never really obstructed to anything that I wanted to do. At the age of 22, I met this one girl who was my colleague at that time. Let's call her A. She was from Delhi. We instantly clicked and became best friends. She was with someone else at that time, who she realized was just an emotionally abusive guy. We used to share everything between each other, with no real feelings of love or anything. We were just best friends, talking 3-4 hours a day.  A few months later, I moved to the US for my masters, while she was still in India. We continued to be in touch. I realized she was way too smart to be working in a stupid IT company and convinced her to pursue her masters as well. Helped with everything - from her application process, helping her with her travel arrangements, and helping her settling down after she reached here. (She enrolled in the same university as me - different course though). Somewhere in this time, I started developing feelings for her. She was going through a rough patch at that time with her ex. And after a few months, I asked her out and she said no, as she was still not over that guy. I spent the next 4 months crying every single night and was in depression - I was in my final semester of my masters, with only a couple of months left to graduate, with no job offer in hand or any internship experience. At some point in time, I decided to move on and found someone else. I had this extremely fucked up status quo with this new girl - When we'd meet and hang out, we'd have the best time. But otherwise there wouldn't be any sort of communication between us. Though I had moved on from my friend, I was still in touch with her. We'd meet often and hang out - we also had a huge group of friends. We still cared for each other.

June 2018  - got my degree, got my job. Everyone's happy.

I told my parents about girl no 2. And they met her and they were happy. I met her parents and they were happy. It all seemed good; except for the fact that the girl would ghost me, every now and then. She'd never call, pick up my calls or reply for a few days. And then she'd come back as if nothing happened. I was too blinded by my stupidity to see how badly I was being played by her. I was pissed off for a long time, but I was just too stupid to see it for what it was.

March 2019;

While I was in this emotionally fucked up state, A and I were talking every day and were still being extremely supportive of each other. We were spending a lot of time together. On the phone, or text, or in person. And one fine day, she asked me out. Now, this was the first time a girl ever asked me out. I've never really heard of that kinda stuff until then - I've always come across only guys asking out girls, not the other way around. And I was never in a relationship before. I started freaking out. She asked me to take some time to think about it, as I was overwhelmed at that point in time.

Growing up, I saw two of my cousins marry outside the caste and their parents ( my mom's siblings) went through extreme depression. They were always ridiculed by other relatives and they were just emotionally distraught. I knew my parents wouldn't be able to take such a news from me - given their age and the laundry list of health problems that they have. I knew if I told her yes, that was a commitment I had to stick to - no matter what.  And that would mean putting my family through extreme pain. I didn't want to tell her a yes, knowing the constraints in my house and then later, tell her that things won't work out - felt that would be cheating her. I feared I'd lose my parents if I just dropped the bomb on them one fine day that, Hey guys, I've been dating someone for 2 years now. And I wanna marry her now. They're not fundamentally opposed to a love marriage - they'd be okay with anyone with the caste / community. And that's how they got married 35 years back. But for them, a north indian girl was something they weren't able to take visualize. They met her and really liked her - as my friend. Their viewpoints were different - and had nothing to do with her as  person. They really respected her. They lived their entire life in a conservative environment and weren't ready to take that culture shock that she would bring. At the same time, she was my best friend. We saw each other grow into better human beings. We understood each other, and considered the other's success as our own. I couldn't tell her no either. I wanted to make sure my parents were on board - so that everyone would be happy in the end. I didn't want any drama later in life - besides, her parents, even though they really liked me, would be super unhappy if they get to know that their daughter wasn't being welcomed with open arms into my house.

This tug-of-war continued for 6 months. I couldn't give her any answer. I wasn't able to convince my parents one bit until then. And to add to all this, my work became super stressful. Coupled with the fact that I've always had low self confidence, and self esteem issues. I was under immense stress for all angles. She understood all of it, and was being supportive. But in the end, I started feeling she deserves better than me, and in some ways, started pushing her away. Never being in a relationship before scared the shit out of me of that commitment of being a ""boyfriend"". Even though, for all inten and purposes, we were already like a couple. I didn't want to lose her, or my parents. After 6 months of struggling with being in a limbo state, she decided to move on. She blocked me. I knew she snapped, and she deserved some space. I reached out to some friends to make sure she was okay. This distance just continued growing, and now, after almost 9 months later, we haven't spoken yet. I kept myself busy with work and other hobbies, but I still continued to talk to my parents about her, hoping that if they finally come around, I'd run back to her and live my life happily with her. AND THEY BLOODY DID. They came around finally, and accepted that they let their fears and biases blur their thinking. And were willing to talk.

But,

she had moved on. I should have seen this coming, but I was just to scared to think about it. She moved on, found another guy, and is now engaged to him. My world turned upside down. My insides churned after hearing this. I had this feeling of emptiness that , I remember, I had when I got to know my grandmother passed away. The realization that this person wouldn't be in life anymore just isn't sinking in. In all fairness to her, I don't blame her for what she did. I wasn't confident at that time that I could conquer the mountain in front of me, and I couldn't give her that confidence either. She deserved happiness, after all she's been through with her ex, and now me. She's an amazing person who, I pray, lives the best and most happiest life possible. And now, hear I am, utterly lost because I lost the one person who cared for me the most. Who saw her success in mine, and was willing to do whatever it takes to see me happy, during my worst times. Now, my folks, on hearing this, have become super depressed, and are extremely apologetic for the pain that me and her went through. My mom , who's health was already bad, is now crying day in and day out about this. My dad is also super depressed.  Looking back, I wish I communicated more with her. But as they say, hindsight is always 20/20.

All in all, I lost my best friend. Now, I can't sleep or eat or work. I just don't know how to move on.",2020.0,5.0,30.0,09:12:46,abuse,26

Suppose you are driving through a residential area at a speed of barely 5-8 kmph while following all the traffic rules.

A crowd gathers. And everyone starts accusing you of hitting the biker with your car. People are like, "" Hmmm.. this rich guy thinks the streets are his dad's property. We will teach him a lesson."" People start discussing about calling the cops and handing you over to cops. But before doing that they want to teach you a lesson by beating you. Because they just wanna prove how righteous and good they are. That they can't stand injustice or the strong bullying the poor or weak. 

The question is, "" What will you do in this situation?""

Now just reverse the positions. Suppose you are on a bike going at a steady speed of say 10 kmph through some residential area while following all the traffic rules and suddenly a car having a rich brat sitting behind the wheel hits you. A crowd gathers this time too. Not to apprehend the rich guy. But to just enjoy the show this time. Nobody steps in to pick you up or ask you whether you are okay or not. People just start making videos as the rich guy steps out of his car, inspects the damage caused to his car by the collision and then starts abusing you. Threatening you. You see people sneering at you. 

What will you do in this situation?

Twitter has banned Alex Jones and other bigots off its platform for misinformation and abusive behaviour. It continues to allow people who are actively inciting hatred and genocidal speeches on Twitter. In fact some of them have blue ticks which gives them a more public standing.

The SM accounts on LinkedIn and Twitter are still active.

Since that post, I have received 2 fraudulent DMCA notices against my site by the impersonating dot IN site signed with MY name - One via my host ([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Dt7Sju7.png)) and another via LinkedIn ([see screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/wxYgmJJ.png))

To deal with this: 

* I have reached out to my host with brief information requesting how this can be tackled. I have not received a response. I believe a counter-notice is the only form they understand. **UPDATE** I filed a counter-notice. There was no other way. My host emailed back saying they process all notices filed completely and I must remove the content within 48 hours or risk suspension. This is so messed up.

* A few minutes back, I posted on Google's Webmaster forum ([link](https://support.google.com/webmasters/thread/44608574?hl=en))
with an entire laundry list of evidence and other shady practices of Metro Rail News and Urban Transport News. All facts are highlighted. Please check it out and upvote the webmaster thread, if possible.

* I have also sent a direct email to John (Google's Webmaster trend analyst) https://twitter.com/JohnMu


What should be my next steps? I need to address two issues:

**First issue**: Responding to the fraudulent DMCA filed against my site by the impersonating site (owned by UTN). My host has told me to ""remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material within 48 hours, and provide written notice to us to that effect when completed."" I fear these shady guys will file more fraudulent notices to have my website suspended.
**UPDATE** I filed a counter-notice. There was no other way. My host said they process all notices filed completely and I must remove the content within 48 hours or risk suspension.

> “Unfortunately, we are not able to make determinations as to the validity of a DMCA notice. If the notice is properly submitted, we are required to take action. The notice was properly submitted. In this case we would be forced to disable the account for the claimed infringement if the material is not removed before the warning period expires.

> If it is your position that the notice is invalid, a counter-claim notice must be submitted and the material in question taken offline for a 10 to 14 business day blackout period. If the complainant does not file legal action against your client in that time, the material may be reposted. “

**Second issue**: Put a stop to this unethical shady behavior? I'm at a loss. full disclosure - I'm a private person, don't like attention and just want to concentrate on writing for my site.

I had a very bad dream today and woke up with a start, it was about my mother getting kidnapped and abused ensuing in a lot of violence I woke up with a start and for a very strange reason I got some weird clarity about what is happening to us a nation and I wanted to type this down.

​

​

1-Delusion: I think CAA NRC protests could have been done with less hype maybe. Shaheen bagh was not a great idea. Protesters got paranoid too quickly. They should not have blocked roads. 

Reality: Our current set of leaders have worsened the basic social contracts slowly and steadily with a promised facade of development.  The UAPA is a clear example. The UAPA and the way it is being used could exactly reflect what will happen once CAA and NRC is enforced.

 Infact take any law in the country, example – The motor vehicle act – Iam applying for a new drivers license.  The government has notified that Aadhar can be used as address proof for getting license. I only have aadhar as address proof. The local transport department randomly saying aadhar is not enough. Now I have to fight them or try and get a ration card to have a ""proper"" address proof as per the whims and fancies of the transport department. 

What instances like this show is that our local law and order and our constitution is enforced and made in such a way that its primary objective is to control the uncouth masses of India. It is not in the service of our citizens. The common citizenry and bureaucracy are at odds with each other. The bureaucracy is happily continuing the master servant relationship we had under the British. And most of us are happily exist in our own bubble thinking this is the reality of life. 

The Shaheen Bagh protests was a good movement, but reality is that it was too small, a bit late and it is already gone. Most people like me thought it was a bad idea. But I realise that it was one of the first true expression of dissent for a long time in our country. The last one was the anti-corruption movement 10 years back. The Americans are fighting now against racism. We should be fighting for existence of democracy. Its not just the BJP our entire political class is designed around authoritarianism and weakening checks and balances. We need to be fighting everyday, we are not. I am not. I am a coward.

​

2-Delusion:  Modi will have to retire without him the BJP will dissolve. So just wait for another 5-10 years. Everything will normalize eventually. Even Indira Gandhi had to go.

Reality: Indira Gandhi the one realistic example of an authoritative leader of our country, who slowly but surely crossed the boundaries of her power. Today a large chunk of our population lack the wisdom to understand that there is no such thing as a benevolent dictator. Surveys show disturbing trends that crave for authoritarianism. 

The BJP maybe a cult of personality but not as much as Indira Gandhi was, they  are trying their best to preserve and pass on the baton to someone else and even Modi understands importance of this.

From our school days a lot of us are molded to form compliant citizens. The irony is that we are also taught that law & order, constitutional rights are all jugaad but government is real. Many of us fail to understand that our government has a social contract with its citizens, and it exists to serve us not the other way around. 

Looking at these tendencies of a large chunk of our population we may end up suspending our electoral process or who knows modi ke baad yogi can turn out to be true. There is no credible opposition it takes decades to build one. All of us were complacent by choosing between congress and BJP and going for lesser of the evils. We did not give anything else a chance or participate in building one, who the fuck wants to be a social activist, Kejriwal got lucky and still it took him more than a decade to build his movement. Who wants to do all this shit, I got a career to take care of.

​

Sonia Gandhi is 73 years she may live another 5-10 years. Till she is alive she will be under a delusion that of making her son the PM. There is almost no hope for congress.

​

There is more than a 60-70% chance that we might end up a authoritative government more wily , smarter than that of Indira Gandhis which could easily outlast her.  Or we may end up with Yogi. 

These odds are not acceptable in real life. Real life can change very fast. All of a sudden we are living in a pandemic.  I don't wish any physical harm on supporters of Hindutva, Hindu Rastra, BJP, Cow. But I feel like a lot of them actively wanting to hurt the opposition and dissent. 

​

 I think I live in a bubble but the bubble is built of soap. It can be burst just blow of air.

I was dreading for this moment since the breakup, I knew she would not let me off the hook so easily, I was sure she was crazy and delusional. There are marks on her hand, which she posted online today, they are of my mothers hands. The day we broke up, we got into a big fight (basically just her, while I was trying to get her to calm down), she got out of the car and strated running around on the side of the road in dead middle of the night. Thats when I had it, and called my parents to get me out of there before she could make the situation any worse. As my parents got there, my mom grabbed her arm as she tried to run away towards the highway and put her in her car. The marks are from that. She could have been hit by a truck and died that day, I still have scars from that. I blamed myself personally responsible for dragging her to this level, and finally managed to calm her down by involving families and got things under control. But, I am scared she will continue to use all of her energy to ruin my life in one way or the other even in the future. I know this sounds far-fetched and crazy, but I want to simply move on from it, we had some good times but mostly bad times, and its good that we found out early enough that we werent the right people for each other.

But I highly doubt, as what I read about Narcissistic personalities online, I find they love taking things out of context, gaslighting and adding fuel to the fire. She has lied to her family and friends quite extensively, and I wouldnt be surprised if I find out she was lying to me about things as well. Today, I threatened to let her family know about a lot of shit that she did and talked about if she continued such erratic behavior, again through the same mutual friend, and somehow she took the entire conversation out of context only leaving the threat part and posted another story.

I’m a Gen Z’er here(born in 2002), fed up and exhausted of our ‘kulcha’(kek..look at my pathetic privileged whining).
To the millennials and Gen X’ers of this sub reddit: I wanted to know your opinion, on how different the Indian society was in the 1990’s compared to 2020, and your experiences navigating through the ups and downs of our societal restrictions and bigotry over the years.

I’ve of late become very interested in economics and geopolitics, in addition to my manic obsession with Indian politics(read: overly pretentious left wing intellectualism). The 1991 reforms( economic liberalization policies) following the fall of the Soviet Union, particularly interest me. At this point in time, it’s an accepted fact that the economic liberalization policies undertaken by the then, Government of India led by P.V Narasimha Rao and Dr. Manmohan Singh back in the early 1990’s against the backdrop of the balance of payments economic crisis undeniably changed the course of the Indian economy for the better(late but better late than never?). It’s economic achievements are well known.

What I’m even more interested in however is how- said reforms and the boom of the internet in the 90’s changed the Indian society in the years to follow.
 I’ve always been a vocal critic of the infamous, great ‘Indian kulcha’(downvote me all you want, kulcha Warriors!). Misogyny-Patriarchy-Sexism, casteism, racism, homophobia, communalism, mind boggling prudishness, psychopathic collectivism, attitudes towards consent, dissent and non-conformity and the overall general bigotry propogated as kulcha, have made me extremely rebellious and snarky(read: pretentious, uppity rabid SJW with no real contribution towards anything substantial.) 

It’s often said that a film Industry is a reflection of it’s society. Bollywood has been known to promote horrifyingly vulgar and misguided(sexist and crass) narratives on romance and chastity. It has also promoted harmful and over the top portrayal of masculinity(toxic and pitiable). This was, as I have seen- rampant in the 90’s). I recently rewatched my mum’s favorite old movie- ‘Mouna Ragam’ directed by  Mani Ratnam, and I was pissed to find out that the film had been rejected vehemently by several producers and was nearly given an A certification because it spoke about/ involved our female protagonist’s unwillingness and rejection of a forced arrange marriage and themes about divorce and separation. I also heard that there was quite an uproar when bollywood decided to portray a women as a serial killer(murderer?). I’ve also heard about batshit insane stories of irrationality, superstition, and violence and abuse on women in my extended family that was in the day, seen as absolutely normal and civil(Although I did want to ask this question years ago, I didn’t have a platform to do so, the above two movie incidents reminded me of this this burning curiosity that I had, had). This leads to believe that if a privileged, upper middle class, city simp like me ever travelled 30 years back into the past, I’d face extremely severe culture shocks that go beyond generational differences. 
 
I also want to use these perspectives, to look forward and into the future of how our society can/might undergo drastic changes if sufficient steps are taken to solve prevalent social issues.

So....any such stories, experiences, perspectives?? Also this is my first post on reddit, so please go easy on me?",2020.0,6.0,6.0,12:19:28,abuse,90
124,124,204,My write up on the CAA,14.0,gbfkzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gbfkzt/my_write_up_on_the_caa/,25.0,1588357281.0,"May come off as biased but whatever idc:

What is the CAA?
To put it simply, there are two meanings to it, one which the government claims and one which is perceived by the public. The government's version is this: CAA gives citizenship to illegal immigrants from neighbouring countries who are facing religious persecution to fix the wrongs of partition. This is nothing but a simple 'good deed' front to cover for the fact of what it actually is. These are the facts to know about the law: the government claims that the law is to help religious refugees, but the law itself nowhere mentions religious persecution as a criteria for offering citizenship. The government claims that it is to fix the wrongs of partition, but the law includes refugees from Afghanistan, which has nothing to do with the partition of India and excludes other partitioned countries. The government claims that it is only for neighbouring countries prosecuting their minorities, but excludes Sri Lanka, which has a history of violence against Tamilians, China, which allegedly has millions of Muslims in detention camps and Myanmar; the government has conveniently picked only Muslim majority nations to portray their narrative of helping the religiously persecuted. 


Another thing to note is the arbitrary cutoff date of 31st Dec. 2014. Anyone who has entered after this date will not be offered citizenship. The government refuses to provide clarification on this date. However the biggest concern regarding the CAA is it's exclusion of Muslims. It only offers citizenship to illegal immigrants of non-Muslim religion and for the first time in Indian history, makes religion a test for citizenship. One may also ask why Muslims will be persecuted in a Muslim majority country; to that the only answer is, are Dalits not persecuted and lynched in public in our country? The CAA coupled with the NRC is an even bigger cause for concern for India's Muslim citizens as the NRC seeks to eliminate people who don't have adequate documentation from their citizenry and with the CAA in play, any non-Muslim can win back back their citizenship. This can cause mass statelessness of Indian Muslims through abuse of power.


This is however, not the first time the ruling party BJP has fanned communal tensions. The BJP has a history of an anti-Muslim rhetoric, with many of its leaders, including Modi, Amit Shah and Prez. Kovind, hailing from the Hindu extremist group RSS, which, according to its handbook, seeks the extermination of Muslims from India like Jews from Germany. The then Chief Minister of Gujarat Narendra Modi was also involved in the 2002 Gujarat pogroms, which saw the violent and brutal killings of over 3000 Muslims. He was denied a US Visa for years owing to his involvement in the riots, and was only given one when he became the PM. The destruction of the Babri Masjid was overseen and provoked by by LK Advani, a then member of the BJP. The perpetrators who demolished themselves claimed to be the workers of BJP.


The anti-secular agenda of the BJP is undeniable and now it comes as no surprise that PM Modi and HM Shah together have created an enemy out of our minorities. The constitutional validity of the CAA and the NRC is currently being heard in the Supreme Court. To conclude, the CAA is simply another pawn in the BJP's game against our minorities, which has been sugar coated by the government as 'helping religiously persecuted refugees'.",2020.0,5.0,2.0,00:06:21,abuse,31

**LOCKER ROOM BOYS**

This morning I woke up to 10s-100s of stories by women condemning the action of an Instagram group ‘Bois locker room’. The “boys” or as I like to call them – ‘*rich daddy’s sons who think owning a Royal Enfield is a great personality’* allegedly shared morphed photos of underage girls, body shaming and slut-shaming them on the group chat. 

It disgusted me, made me feel ill, but did not surprise me. Growing up I have realized that a lot of men (the majority of whom I know) have said at least a couple of very misogynistic things, some even worse than that group in front of me. 

**DEBUNKING ARGUMENTS** –

**1.** Let’s start with the most important one that anti-feminists use : **False Rape Claims**

\- ‘On the question of false rape, her findings were mixed. More than one third of the 460 cases involved young people who had engaged in consensual sex outside marriage until their parents found out and used the criminal justice system to end the relationship.

\- ""Families are more willing to have the stigma of rape rather than having the stigma of their daughter choosing her own sex or life partner,"" she says. Shrinivasan found that many of these cases dealt with inter-caste or mixed-religion relationships which are considered taboo in conservative society.

\- ""I was repeatedly seeing stories of women being picked up in moving cars, being given a cold drink laced with sedatives which would render them unconscious, and then they would be raped,"" she said. ""But when I started reading more and more cases I realized that there are patterns to how complaints are filed. So this sedative-laced drink becomes important because it is necessary to show that consent was not given."" 

\- ""The parents say, 'You've lost your virginity, it's going to be impossible to get you married, you file this case, he'll get scared and he'll marry you,'"" says Shrinivasan. ""In some cases it would be the argument of the defence that the woman was trying to abstract money,"" she says. ""But I cannot think of a case where this was proven.""

\- While Shrinivasan's study would appear to indicate that the proportion of false rape cases in Delhi is high by international standards - in more than one country, researchers have put the proportion of false rape claims at about 8% of the total - academic Nithya Nagarathinam argues that this is a distraction from a more pressing issue, the under-reporting of rape. 

\- ""Although there has been a jump in rape reporting since the Delhi gang-rape, there are still many cases that go unreported and there are so many reasons for that,"" she says, pointing to traditional patriarchal structures that mean violence against women is consistently downplayed. ""That is a more serious issue to me than a few cases where the parents have probably wrongly accused the man."" Nagarathinam cites a 2014 study using data from the Indian National Crime Records Bureau and the National Family Health Surveys that suggests only 6% of incidents of sexual violence against women are reported to the police.’ [https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-38796457](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-38796457). 

2. Rape claims that come after years of the incident are only to malign the character of the man and not true.

\- This is again false as psychologists agree that a sexual assault victim’s response at times is to pretend that the attack never happened to them or suppress their memory of the incident. So these are very rarely false. 

\- When certain men who assaulted a woman become a public figure, their victims feel compelled to tell the truth because they know these men abuse their power and so for these women, this becomes their chance of calling out their abusers so as to stop further misconduct. And this is very important in some cases where men might use their power to suppress legal proceedings against their selves. 

3. Feminists are trying to make all men look like predators or Feminists hate all men. 

\- Again this isn’t true. Feminists are not trying to make all men look like assholes. They’re trying to show a systematic problem that is the patriarchal society that values men’s dominance more than a women’s freedom. 

\- Not only movements like #NotAllMen or #MenToo are generally a retaliation against women standing up to their abusers but was and still is a forefront of the right-wing extremist political ideologies and has been co-opted by them to shift the narrative from ‘Women are oppressed and want equal rights’ to ‘Women are trying to destroy our culture and forcing a female dominant society’ which is wrong and at best a strawman argument. 

\-  

4. Women are getting extra rights. 

\- Women are not getting extra rights. This is a false equivalency 

\- The best example to explain this is the free bus and local travel for women in Delhi which was started by AAP government. They introduced free bus rides for women and are going to roll over free metro or subsidized metro rates for women in the future. 

\- Now some people are characterizing this as extra rights for women. 

\- Now to understand this let’s begin with some basic points- Delhi has been and still is one of the most unsafe cities for women in India and the World. So by this argument, it can be established that social security to a woman is impinged upon which means they already do not have similar security as a man as they are disproportionately targeted only on the basis of gender.

\- By this, we can conclude that providing more security to a woman means we are giving them a similar right to security than actually providing them with more than men. 

\- Finally not only did women feel much safer with this scheme by AAP, they also noticed that the harassment on buses decreased. 

5. Women shouldn’t upload revealing photos and shouldn’t send nudes to men. It’s their fault that they weren’t cautious.

\- The first one is completely arbitrary based on the culture. What might be revealing to you might be normal to someone else. 

\- Not only that but a woman’s right to her body is more important than a culture or religion’s right to morality in a democratic country. A woman can do whatever she wants and post whatever she wants anyplace she wants. Nobody has a right to shame or harm her because of this.

\- Secondly, sending nudes is a known and completely natural sexual activity – ‘exhibitionism’ and is not a crime. If she consents it to another person (her partner or a friend or anyone she knows), it’s her right to do so, but these men have no right to share it. That is a crime as it should be. Shaming women on the basis of nudes is absolutely patriarchal and barbaric and is significant of a certain mentality of controlling women. 

\- Another important point is that if you’re saying that it’s a women’s job to be completely closeted to protect herself from sexual or violent crimes, you mean that a women’s human rights are less important the civic duties of the perpetrator of said crimes. (It’s not your job to not get murdered right?)

6. Men and Women’s rights should be covered equally by the media instead of focusing on only Women’s rights

\- Not only does media not cover women’s rights but it also shapes it much worse and is almost always causing trouble to victims

\- One example is – “Pollachi ‘sexual abuse’ complainant says she was not sexually abused” was a headline by a known newspaper. In reality, the complainant had always maintained that she had not been raped, but had been stripped naked and filmed without her consent. By twisting these words to say that ‘she had not been sexually abused’, while also putting ‘sexual abuse’ in quotes, the headline casts her testimony as falsehood.

7. The Current False Rape Claim case that came to light today. (I’m not going to use anyone’s names because it’s not my right to)

\- Alright so let’s summarize what happened. A girl accused a boy online of sexually assaulting her 2 years ago and used his name in the post. This was picked up by a lot of Instagram accounts and then they shared it. Quite possibly a lot of people on social media went on to harass the guy. The boy committed suicide. Finally, the family of the boy put a post online stating that he was innocent and that the girl did this for fame and again people started sharing this instead.

\- So who is right here and who is wrong? This question might seem very easy to answer but chances are you’re quite wrong. And also I am no one to judge or are you. Only a court can decide that. 

\- Women who have been victims of sexual assault have vastly different coping mechanisms and there have been numerous studies that would show how much array of responses can be seen as a response. But the most common are- PTSD, Depression, and Rape Trauma syndrome.

\- Social media has taken over our whole world and is now a counted coping mechanism for women. It has both negative and positive effects on victims of abuse. 

\- I read the post of the girl who called out her potential abuser. The story wasn’t unbelievable and was quite the characteristic of how many sexual assaults take place. So claiming she’s lying is absolutely wrong. The reason she couldn’t have proved that the boy had done is because rape allegations are already difficult to prove and also because years later it becomes almost impossible to prove. This might have been a manic phase of calling out her abuser if she was suffering from bipolar disorder quite easily caused by such an act of abuse.

\- Now let’s look at the other side. The boy committed suicide because of retaliation from social media and if the case didn’t actually happen he could’ve felt a sudden mental trauma because of such a large online audience trying to hurt him or his family. 

\- My next few lines might be very hurtful to some, but the truth is a hard pill to swallow. Him committing suicide does not mean he might’ve been innocent. A lot of studies in the past have shown that suicide has not only been used to flee justice but also that some people consider it the ultimate form of justice for their sins ([https://lawprofessors.typepad.com/evidenceprof/2018/10/assume-that-a-defendant-who-has-been-charged-with-a-crime-attempts-suicide-while-detained-prior-to-trial-should-evidence-of.html](https://lawprofessors.typepad.com/evidenceprof/2018/10/assume-that-a-defendant-who-has-been-charged-with-a-crime-attempts-suicide-while-detained-prior-to-trial-should-evidence-of.html), [https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=3143&context=law\_lawreview](https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=3143&context=law_lawreview))

\- Now, this in no way proves that he did it or he didn’t but his suicide is also not something to shame the supposed victim for. 

\- **The sole responsibility for this suicide and a future one shall lie on the social media circus and not on either the accused or the victim (until it’s proven that the claim was false) simply because internet shouldn’t dictate who’s innocent or not.** 

\- **The reason she never filed a case does not mean he’s innocent and just because he committed suicide does not mean he’s guilty.**

\- A rape claim that might have resulted in a legal case has been derailed by the so called heroes who not only create an opinion on these stories to boost their ego and for their own political purposes. So for the last time –**THE ONLY PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAN’S SUICIDE OR THE WOMAN’S HARASSMENT THAT IS ENSUING RIGHT NOW IS EVERYONE WHO IS VEHEMENTLY DRAWING CONCLUSIONS OF THEIR OWN ON AND ACTING LIKE IT’S PROOF FOR SOMETHING. BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF SOCIAL MEDIA JUDGES, YOU EITHER KILLED AN INNOCENT PERSON OR ARE HARASSING ONE NOW. STOP AND RE-THINK, THE ‘LOCKER ROOM THING’ AND THIS ARE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AND SOMEONE PAID WITH THEIR LIFE FOR YOUR EGO. DO NOT DIRECT YOUR HATE TO THE FAMILY OF THE BOY OR THE GIRL.**

**CRIME AGAINST WOMEN IN INDIA –**

Two main types of rape that are prevalent in Indian Society which are political rapes and honor (izzat) rapes. 

Here are some harrowing statistics related to crimes against women - 

1.  “Violence against women in India is actually more present than it may appear at first glance, as many expressions of violence are not considered crimes, or may otherwise go unreported or undocumented due to certain Indian cultural values and beliefs. These reasons all contribute to India's Gender Inequality Index rating of 0.524 in 2017, putting it in the bottom 20% of ranked countries for that year” (1). 

2.  “A total of 2,44,270 incidents of crime against women (both under IPC and SLL) were reported in the country during the year 2012 as compared to 2,28,650 in the year 2011 recording an increase of 6.4% during the year 2012. These crimes have continuously increased during 2008 - 2012 with 1,95,856 cases in the year 2008, 2,03,804 cases in 2009 and 2,13,585 cases in 2010 and 2,28,650 cases in 2011 and 2,44,270 cases in the year 2012” (2) – By a report by NCRB (National Crime Records Bureau, 2013). This increased to 329243 in 2017 (6).

3. 65% of Indian men believe women should tolerate violence in order to keep the family together, and women sometimes deserve to be beaten. (3) In January 2011, the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) Questionnaire reported that 24% of Indian men had committed sexual violence at some point during their lives (3).

4. Exact statistics on the extent of case occurrences are very difficult to obtain, as a large number of cases go unreported. This is due in large part to the threat of ridicule or shame on the part of the potential reporter, as well as an immense pressure not to damage the family's honor. (4) For similar reasons, law enforcement officers are more motivated to accept offers of bribery from the family of the accused, or perhaps in fear of more grave consequences, such as Honor Killings (4).

**CONCLUSION-** 

1. Women are not trying to earn fame by making a rape case. IT HAPPENS. Every woman has a right to be heard and believed. They should be believed in a fashion where they’re not shamed for coming out until a verdict is passed. 

2.  Instead of teaching girls how to dress and behave, we have an urgent need to make boys realize their civil duties and teach them that women are equal and that women are not just objects of desire for them.

3. Our cultures that have been for centuries forcing us to believe that men are better and that women have certain gender roles – needs to go. Cultures that are resistant to change are blatantly misguiding people (No single religion holds this problem, all of them do. Do not use this for your bigotry. Accept your mistakes and solve them instead of counting others’)

4. I’m not saying that false rape claims do not happen. They do. But they’re very incidental and the hysteria surrounding it is wrong. And only a family who has faced it would know what it means. 

5. One last thing - if you’re still blind enough to believe woman are not facing a crisis of security and respect, or if you believe that you have no stand on this, then you’re a part of the problem because you’d rather let oppression happen than acknowledge it. 

***The hottest places in Hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict.***

\- ***Martin Luther King Jr.***

Tldr, There is no such thing as false rape case epidemic. But there is definitely an epidemic of women’s suffrage. This boys locker room might’ve been a wake up call but the social media storm destroyed it and divided us into two different sets of people - one who can acknowledge that there’s an injustice against women and the other ones who can’t accept facts.",2020.0,5.0,22.0,04:00:43,abuse,10
129,129,212,My experience attending a protest for the first time as a 17 y/o:,75.0,g7awra,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g7awra/my_experience_attending_a_protest_for_the_first/,19.0,1587772708.0,"This was written by me a day after the protest, so the timeline will be referred to that way.

Yesterday, for the first time ever, I took part in a protest. A protest which would open my eyes and show me our country like I had never seen before. Despite having a general fear of being in a large crowd and being surrounded by people, I, for the first time ever, felt safe being in the middle of a literal ocean of people. I felt powerful; not in the sense that I alone had the power to influence, but in the sense that my presence contributed to OUR power to influence. Walking into the protest, I expected a lot of pushing and punching but to my surprise, I was not touched a single time. I had a better experience being in a crowd at a protest than I did being in a crowd at the Tirupati darshan. Despite the sheer volume of people present (over 1 lakh) the crowd was the most organized I had ever seen. Then I realised that there was only one thing that separated this crowd from any other crowd: lack of a selfish motive. Every person present did not come for their own personal gain, but for the gain of the country. Be it a crowd at a darshan or a crowd at a bazaar, everyone is there for their own personal benefit. Even at the school assembly, everyone seeks that one extra minute to complete their homework, one extra minute to form their lines, one extra minute to talk to their friends, all for personal gain; which makes the crowd at the assembly seem un-organized. But at this protest, the people represented the common voice on the streets, not themselves. No one expected to have gained anything at the end of the night. Which is what makes a protest so special. 

On the sight of me, my sister and my mom, a few protesters gave us a word of thanks for attending. They were happy to see Hindus taking part too. That made realise that despite this being a Muslim majority protest, it was not about the Muslims. It was not about fighting the government for being excluded. It was not about religion at all. It was, rather, about the absence of religion. About treating everyone as if religion didn't exist. It was not about fighting the government to be included in the list, it was about removing the list altogether. We were fighting for the up-keeing of the Constitution. A Constitution the ruling party does not seem to respect. Throughout our childhood in India, we were taught to look at religion and treat religions with respect. The problem didn't start when we were told to respect other religions, but when we were told to look at religion in the first place. Today when we read a name, the first thing we see is a religion. Lakshmi means Hindu, Ali means Muslim, John means Christian. I myself am guilty of this too but today, the protest showed me that despite religion being deep-rooted in our culture, we can learn to look past it.

A fact: public lunching has more than doubled since 2014, that is, since the BJP came to power. The victims of most of these lynchings were innocent Muslims. These murders have been left unresolved after the government refused to do anything about it. Mob lynchers have even credited Modi as their reason for feeling ""empowered"". Any voice of dissent against the government would be silenced by these lynchers. Today, these voices cannot be silenced. They cannot be killed. It's far too late for that. Finally, the government has received it's most worthy opposition: it's own people. A government which does not respect it's criticism is no government at all. The government is still trying to silence dissent in it's controlled states. UP, Karnataka and Delhi are facing the brunt of this; signs of fear in the ruling party. But every act to silence only raises more voices. And the unity of these voices creates waves; waves which make a difference.

That day I learnt the true meaning of unity in diversity. I learnt what India stands for. I learnt how powerful a protest really is. I learnt the power of unity. And no, Unity is not a 3000 crore statue. As we marched, we saw and heard slogans and chants, some abusing the government and some stating the objective, but there was one chant which stuck with me and kept me thinking about the state of our country: Hindu Muslim Sikh Isai, bhai bhai bhai bhai.

My brother has some issues with his marriage & I need some advice on how to protect our family.

My brother & sister-in-law had a baby in December. She went to her parents' house in a nearby city for delivery & the baby was born some 10 days before the expected date. So my bro wasnt able to be there with her at the time of birth but made it to the hospital just 4 hours after birth.

The girl's parents have made a huge issue out of this & are accusing my brother of 'not caring enough for the child'. I mean, his wife basically has his debit card with her (she doesn't have a job now but had one in the past & we did not ask her to quit it either). She has been free to use it whenever she wants to & my brother doesn't ask her about what she spends on unless its at a hospital, which makes sense. Mother-in-law had a heated argument with my brother over this minor issue & my brother & wife stopped talking to each other for a couple of weeks.

We met the baby in their house for a ritual on completing one-month & even then it was an uneasy calm.

Then lockdown happened & they haven't met since.

Things cooled down after a few weeks but the baby has had some minor health issues & their family are hiding the baby's health reports from us. They also decline to share the baby's weight with us & my mother was verbally abused in vulgar words by the in-laws when she asked. They accused us of 'not taking care of the baby'. Seriously? There is a fucking lockdown & inter-state transport is not allowed. Money is not a problem either as mentioned above.

Recently the girl & her parents laid down some criteria to continue the marriage & return back to my bro's house:

1. My brother has to disclose his bank balance to the girl's parents. My brother had shared those details with his wife post marriage 4 years ago but he is not comfortable sharing now as the info will be relayed to her parents. FYI, he works at a top MNC & owns a 3 BHK house in a major Indian Metro. So I don't see the point of worrying about financial security.

2. My parents should not visit my brother's house at any cost. They are already a nuclear family but the girl wants him to completely sever the relationship it seems. FYI, my parents live in a neighbouring state & just visit once in a while. Even when they visit, its my old mother who does all the household chores & runs the family, so his wife can't accuse us of that either.

We honestly dont understand what their motive is, as their criteria doesn't make a lot of sense.

They are now threatening to file a harassment case if their conditions are not met, although there was no dowry involved in the marriage & there were no requests from us post mrg either. They have zero proof to produce in court anyway.

Ive advised my brother to seek legal advice asap but he is too naive & brushes it saying 'they don't mean it seriously'.

AFAIK, dowry harassment in India seems to be a case of 'guilty until proven innocent' scenario. We are confident of winning any case as would be a fake accusation & they don't have any proof to back their claims.

But I don't want my 65+ parents with health issues to undergo any legal hassles or in the worst case wrongful detention for no fault of theirs. **So pls provide some pointers on how I could safeguard my family from legal issues/wrongful detention**

### Tl;dr

We wrote to the Ministry of Women & Child Development and Delhi Commission for Women about the need to address image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material on the internet in a rights respecting manner in light of the recent 'Boiz Locker Room' incident. Through this representation, we have tried to provide a broader picture of inadequacies in the existing legal and institutional framework to address these problems and highlighted the role of patriarchal socio-cultural attitudes in emboldening young boys to commit such acts. We have also made nine specific recommendations to ensure the internet remains a safe space for young girls and women where they are allowed to participate on an equal basis and express themselves freely.

### Background

In a recent headline grabbing incident, teenage male students from Delhi were called out for sharing sexualized images of young women including girls below the age of 18 years on an Instagram group called 'Boiz Locker Room.' [**Media reports**](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/bois-locker-room-case-5-boys-questioned-over-messages-on-instagram-group-6396040/) suggest that the boys used the group to sexualize images posted by girls on their social media accounts and even shared morphed images. More disturbingly, [**reports**](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bois-locker-room-delhi-schoolboys-create-group-to-share-lewd-photos-chats-on-classmates-1674303-2020-05-04) indicate that in addition to non-consensually sharing images, the boys made misogynistic remarks objectifying the girls and even threatened to leak nude images of the girls who exposed the group.

### Need for Accountability and Rehabilitation

We, at IFF, have consistently sought reform of India's obscenity laws which are rooted in notions of victorian morality rather than individual autonomy and consent. However, online image based sexual abuse is very different from consensual pornography and it subjects women to immense psychological trauma and social stigma. Therefore, there exists a legitimate need to prohibit and punish such harmful conduct. 

Nevertheless, we must be wary of adopting punitive and carceral approaches in cases where the perpetrators are minors and there is no accompanying violence. For young offenders, the focus must be on re-education and rehabilitation, and we must acknowledge the role played by patriarchal socio-cultural attitudes which teach boys to objectify and dehumanize women from a young age.

### Lack of Institutional Capacity

The government has established helplines, online portals and special investigative units to address cyber crimes against women and children but these measures have failed to result in greater reporting, investigation and prosecution of online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material. As per the National Crime Records Bureau’s [**latest Crime in India Report**](https://ncrb.gov.in/crime-india-2018), there were only 862 cases registered under Section 67A (publication of sexually explicit material) and Section 67B (publication of sexually explicit material depicting children) of the IT Act in 2018. Similarly, only 781 cases were registered under Section 14 and 15 (storage and possession of child pornography) of the POCSO Act in 2018. 

These figures are shockingly low considering India’s large population, growing internet user base and the relatively higher number of cases reported for other cybercrimes. The scope of the problem is much larger than these figures indicate as out of the total 16.9 million reports received by the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children in the United States in 2019, India accounted for 1,987,430 suspected child sexual exploitation reports. Therefore, proactive information disclosure and performance audits are absolutely necessary to ensure that existing mechanisms to eliminate online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material are functioning effectively.

### Rights Respecting Solutions

In our representation, we have stressed that governments should not force intermediaries to adopt rights harming measures such as weakening of encryption standards.  We had also previously highlighted these concerns in [**our submission**](https://internetfreedom.in/porn-is-complex-we-call-for-further-study/) to the Ad Hoc Rajya Sabha Committee on the impact of pornography on children headed by Shri Jairam Ramesh. 

It is our belief that strong encryption is necessary to protect the privacy and security of individuals, businesses and government actors who use the internet, and this is especially true for groups which lack social power such as women and other marginalized communities. Any weakening of encryption standards would leave us all vulnerable to misuse of our personal data and communications by bad actors including malicious hackers, organized criminals, terrorist groups and hostile nation states.   


The importance of security and privacy enhancing technologies like encryption for women is also borne out of past experience of hackers targeting accounts of women to access their private photos. For instance, in 2014, hackers leaked over 500 private photos of various female celebrities by breaching iCloud’s services. Therefore, any decision to weaken the security of our intimate communications  by mandating weak encryption standards or creation of backdoors would leave women even more vulnerable to online image based sexual abuse. 

### Final Recommendations

In the spirit of constructive solution oriented engagement, we have offered the following nine recommendations to ensure the internet is a safe space for women and young girls where they are allowed to participate on an equal basis and express themselves freely:

>1. Seek information from authorities responsible for facilitating reporting of online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material about the number of complaints received from individuals, intermediaries, watchdog groups and international law enforcement agencies.  
>  
>2. Seek information from authorities responsible for investigating and prosecuting online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material about the number of complaints in which follow up action was taken such as investigation, identification of perpetrators and filing of criminal charges.  
>  
>3. Conduct an audit to evaluate the performance of existing helplines, online reporting portals and specialized investigation units.  
>  
>4. Provide more funding, personnel and technical resources to existing helplines, online portals and specialized investigation units after an assessment of their needs.  
>  
>5. Work closely with schools and colleges to create a Standard Operating Procedure \[SOP\] which provides safe spaces for young girls and women to report such illegal behaviour in a manner which does not invite larger social stigma and also provides them the agency to choose the next steps they feel comfortable with.  
>  
>6. Encourage intermediaries to adhere to industry best practices for eliminating online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material which may require deployment of specialized software or fast-tracking human review by content moderators in such cases.  
>  
>7. Any technical measures adopted to address online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material should not undermine the privacy and security of all users by weakening encryption. Instead, the focus should be on capacity building and providing adequate resources to law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute these offences.  
>  
>8. Ensure that students receive mandatory and regular gender sensitization and sex education in their schools which is centered on the principles of consent and women’s autonomy.  
>  
>9. Consider partnerships with women’s rights groups, child rights groups, digital rights groups and social networks to collaboratively work towards leveraging technology to sensitise young people and parents about healthy sexual conduct and behaviour.

In the end, we would like to acknowledge that a lot of our work on issues like online harassment is shaped by prior research done by other digital rights organizations like the Internet Democracy Project, Point of View and Centre for Internet & Society and we would urge you to follow their work as well!

He did the same to me, opened our mail, forged our signatures on documents where convenient, and was just a miserable person in general. 

Even in the Indian American community most people despise him for various reasons, so I know this is not normal.

I no longer speak to him. He tried to force the IRS and DMV  (in the US) to hand over my information but was refused.

I have wondered what life would have been like if he didn't move to the US.  2 questions regarding this:

1. I know in India this behavior is still not normal. My question is, what percentage of Indian men become deeply abusive like this? I have suspected he grew up under equally damaging conditions. My grandpa passed away when I was 5 or 6 so I could never tell. 
2. If I ceased contact with him, except in India, does the father have special powers to get information for adult children? Perhaps by lying to authorities in some way (""My son needs supervision due to illness)?

&#x200B;

So yeah, maybe I don't know so many indians and of course i can't speak for all of them, but literally every single one of the ones i've been exposed to except for mutahar from ""some ordinary gamers"" youtube channel are very arrogant and/or egotistical. For example i've met and talked to or been exposed to people from india or with an indian background on the internet, living in canada, in my country and abroad in other countries in europe and also in china and japan. Oh and of course indian scammers through the phone and in videos (lol).

Some of the things I've noticed a lot is that they will say India is the greatest country ever, better and more powerful than the US, russia and china combined, they will bloat and lie in a ""lie, cheat or steal"" kind of attitude in order to not admit that maybe they are not the best country or that they personally are not the greatest in math or tech in the world.

&#x200B;

Like for example i'm from a third world country and it's okay, got no problem with that. When I went to school a classmate who is from india while in canada kept saying how india is the greatest nation to ever exist and me and a friend just told him that was stupid nationalism and even if it mattered it's obvious india can't be the best at everything because no country can but man was he stubborn about the matter.

&#x200B;

I've noticed many people like for example phone scammers act this way to justify shitty actions, especially against americans, which i mean, yeah, everybody hates americans, i get it, but why make stuff up to justify yourself or why pretend or lie about being better than others?

&#x200B;

Also i've noticed many times that many indians cheat or lie and when caught they will never ever accept it, this happened with some people who stole money from my parents and even on private face to face conversations they acted as if it never happened when everybody involved knows it did, there was no point on lying. Months later that same person asked for money and said he would call the cops because of the illegal practices we did if he didnt have the money. And of course there were no illegal practices, he could've just said he was going to sue us on fake allegations but he chose to flat out lie in a way that even a 5 year old could tell it was a lie. That lie was so stupid that of course the cops never showed up and he never sued us.

&#x200B;

Now don't get me wrong, ive met some really cool indian people, and some of the people that i've seen having this attitude are actually very good people, or at least most of the time, but I just don't get it, everytime i have called on or seen an indian person being called on some arrogant or selfish behaviour they traight up LIE with the worst lies ever, they would make up literally ANYTHING before accepting they may be wrong and not be the best person in the whole planet.

&#x200B;

I just find it interesting that this kind of personalities have been present every single time i have been exposed to indian people. Especially since ive seen a lot of indian people who will cheat or backstab others without remorse and then just lie about it compared to people from other cultures ive met. (ive travelled and lived aborad a lot so indian people are just one of the several cultures ive been exposed to a lot , and this came to my mind after a long time when reading people expressing the same feelings online

&#x200B;

it's like if you get caught pointing a gun to someones head and say ""yeah, it wasn't me, it was someone else"" like dude i saw it was you, did you really think that would change my mind?

&#x200B;

I mean is there a cultural reason behind it?

&#x200B;

Is india a very nationalist country that brainwashes people?

&#x200B;

do indian people live in denial?

&#x200B;

or maybe it's just a huge coincidence? then why am i not the only one who thinks that?

&#x200B;

the best example i can think of is the ""designated pooping street"" meme where some guy tries so hard to make india look like a first world country when it clearly isnt and everybody knows it. Why pretend being someone you're not? as a fellow third world country dweller i just accept my country is great in some aspects and needs huge improvement in others, it's okay

&#x200B;

I just don't get it

&#x200B;

what is your own opinon on it? maybe some of you actually have seen this on your fellow countrymen and actually dont like it? or am projecting a wrongful perception of people from india?

I'd like to know what you guys think :)

&#x200B;

edit: after rereading my post i think i left there a chance to sound like i'm saying all people i know from india are bad people, just in case, it was only a handful of truly bad experiences but the proud/arogant attitude is what i'm asking about, i'm not saying all indians are cheaters or back stabbers, i'm saying that the ones that actually are (like in any culture there will be some) will have this attitude and it's interesting how far they will go to keep a lie or avoid criticism even if it's clear they are wrong. 

Also the good indian people i know may show this arrogant side of them just when talking about countries or politics, not always, of course, i'm not saying it is always a very defining trait of their personality, but a trait that is very common to surface at least once in my own experience.

I hope i didn't offend anyone because i am genuinely interested in this, i like indian food, folklore, art and philosophy i am personally inclined to buddhism :) ",2020.0,4.0,20.0,13:28:31,abuse,

We moved from India to America when I was five and I remember the flight here but being the same ethnicity as my parents and their only child, I never would’ve thought I was adopted. The only reason they told me was when I accidentally overheard them speaking about it when I was nine and I wouldn’t stop asking so they admitted it. 

My mother couldn’t have kids and in our culture (Indian) not having children is looked down upon. The first story I was ever told was that I was abandoned on a busy street and was given to my parents by my aunt since they were an older childless couple. No official documentation, no information on who my birth parents are or why they left me. Abandoning baby girls in India is common and many die/get abused so my parents always told me they saved my life. I accepted this story and didn’t think much of it. 

In high school I started asking more questions. I had another friend from India who was adopted too, but by white parents. She told me I was so lucky to be adopted within my own community. I felt grateful for my parents in that moment and brought it up to them. My parents were just silent. I remember being weirded out by their reactions. As I got them to tell me the story I noticed a difference then what I was told before. In this retelling, instead of getting found on the street, I was left in an orphanage. This was not what I had been told before. 

When I addressed the new detail they tried to deny the first story, then said I was technically left on the street near the orphanage. Orphanages have records and a process to go through and I brought that up. I asked to see my records and my mom got upset and my dad started screaming telling me to stop questioning them and that all I need to know is that I was saved from being an orphan.

It was BS and I had an entire mental breakdown about it. Why tell two different stories? Why not tell me I was adopted until I was 10? I’ve never been back India but I want to trace my adoption. Because why is the story changing? I’m now 19 and I still think about it everyday. Whenever I bring it up I’m shut down and gaslighted. They say my first memory when I was 9 is not real and that I was adopted I’m too embarrassed to tell anyone.

We have been married for around 10 yrs.  Our relationship turned sour when we got pregnant with a girl in between the boys that we mutually decided to terminate because she had some severe birth defects and was very unlikely to survive birth.  Since the past 5 years or so we have been sleeping in separate beds in our house , Not much of  a relationship but I decided that I love my boys too much and I will do whatever I need to be close to them.

But of late things have taken a turn for the worse.  Since the past 12 years she has known me I have always been the kind of guy to have a beer or two 4-5 days a week.  She was the same and much worse until she got a DUI last year that ended costing us 20K in lawyer  / uber fees for around three months she wasn't allowed to drive to work. What really hurt me wasn't the fact that she got a DUI but that she would come in late from work and make excuses and I would have to take care of the kids both in the morning and night while being full time employed all in the name of her busy work / conferences.  Once I even found hotel receipt in her car for a night she claimed she worked until 5am in the morning. We live in the suburbs (around 30 miles from the city) and she  chose to attend multiple conferences staying at a hotel in the city further burdening me with kids rather than just simply drive to these conferences.

What has changed recently during the coronavirus lockdown is the she has started accusing me of being of mean to our kids and threatening and abusive to her. She comes running down if I ever try to discipline our kids with a timeout or threat to take away their toys temporarily if they don't follow the rules.  I am talking about things like don't shoot the nerf guns at each other or at daddy's face.  When I asked what she means by threatening and abusive at her. she replied "" I feel like I don't feel safe living here with you when you drink and that if we were living in India where they didn't have good laws regarding domestic violence you would have hit me"". I don't to what to make of it. She thinks that because my parents were physically abusive to each I would do the same to her and the kids when there has not been a single instance of it through 12 years of us knowing each other.  The last straw was when my 8yr old suggested to me after coming back with an afternoon walk with her that he saw a great house for sale in the neighborhood and it would be great if we bought that house as well so mommy could live in that house and daddy could live in this one and he can ride/bike between these houses. When I confronted my wife on it and said it was unacceptable behavior and almost borderline parent alienation her exact response was

""I do disagree. \[8r old\] was excited by the idea and we only talked about how this would potentially work because he could go between the houses and be with either or both of us so frequently. So that is the opposite of parental alienation. It’s actually a maxization of their time with both parents given the situation""

We met on tinder and our compatibility came from the fact that both of us have been raped as kids. it took us more than 2 months to get over our haptophobia to even hug each other. We have grown a lot closer than I've seen other people do. We spent the next month being with/near each other as much as we could, during which she told me about all the other abuses that she has suffered.

I'll  take them one at a time, chronologically. First was when she was 3 years old and the help in her house had raped her repeatedly, for this she has had multiple surgeries and even went to court to get justice but the accused was acquitted. Next was when she about 9 or 10 and one of her uncles raped her and no one knew about it. The next one was about this classmate of hers at the age of 14, who she still is in occasional contact with. The next was when she 19, her ex of two years raped her repeatedly and abused her in addition to that. All of these she mentioned to me in the 2nd or 3rd month of us being together. We took a week long trip in the 3rd month where we literally spent each second with each other. On this trip she told me that both her and mother and father had sexually abused her. Up until this point, I had no reason to doubt her and believed her and still do.

She moved to Australia in the fourth month (I am in India) and things were going relatively well, but a month after her move she told me about this time that she was raped by her mother's cousin and two of his friends  and it was her mother who had arranged for the entire thing as a punishment for her. This came as a shock, first I believed her but then I noticed that that some of these followed a pattern (still speculating), wherein whenever things are going normal and nothing exciting is happening she tells me about one of these incidents. Right after this she told me about this guy in Australia who had molested her and gave me a bunch of details about it. Again, I decided to take her word for it. But last night we were having a fight about the fact that i spent hours talking to friends at night, one of whom is a female  and she knows about it. I never lied to her about it and have always given straight replies to all of her questions and after the fight was over and I told her that this won't happen again, she modified her previous account and said that the Australian guy had raped her and gave a bunch of other details about it, which did not match with the previous account.

Now, here's where I stand. I believe her accounts of rape that happened when she was a child, ones relating to her mother (horrible person) and the one about her ex (she has shared some text exchanges between the two of them with me). But I'm not sure about all of the other 'stories' because I have no way to verify these and she won't let me call the cops on the Australian guy because she says that she too would be deported because of it. I think that because of her fucked up past and family, she makes up these 'stories' (again, just a speculation right now) to make sure that I stay with her and keep on sympathizing with her. This is my first romantic relationship,don't know what to do, help!

Edit 1: She's also in contact with her abusive ex.

Edit 2: I love her, we have other issues but I think I got lucky with her. I know she loves me too and has done so much for me. She's shown me a happier future for myself, something I never could see before.

TL;DR: My girlfriend has given me a bunch of accounts of her rapes and believe only some of them because of the inconsistency in timing and details.",2020.0,4.0,20.0,04:38:56,abuse,23

Now she has locked herself in her room, her neck pains and her arms too. She's crying and I can't do anything to help her.

I was a 28-year-old virgin when I installed the dating app called OKC. I am from India and my parents had started looking for a bride, which I wasn't so thrilled about, so I decided I 'll look out for someone actively. 28-year-old virgin isn't such a big deal here I guess, as I know a few friends who never had pre-marital sex.I had messaged to hundreds of people and a few had replied and one amongst them was this wonderful angel called XX. She had messaged that she was just looking for friends there, however, I was clear about my intentions with her. I had messaged that *I am cool with us being friends, but I was looking for relationship there.*   
We decided to meet for a Movie when Joker was released and we enjoyed the movie. After the movie, she said that her parents are not at home and that she has to go back to her relatives' home whom she isn't very thrilled about. So we decided to spend some time around, had lunch, walked in a park and then I suggested her to come to my home to watch the sunset as I live in a small penthouse (minus all the luxury part.)  Then when she mentioned that she would be going back to her relatives' home and that she isn't so happy about it, I asked her to stay back.

I  had my first kiss that night, though recently I learned that it wasn't a great experience for her. When we were lying close, I just moved closer and closer to her and when I was about to kiss her, I asked her whether can I kiss, which apparently broke all the buildup. :-/   

We started hanging out very often after that night, we made love that week and I was constantly in cloud nine. Things started moving pretty fast and in a month, we were head over heels!

However, I had lied to her about my past and had said that I had an ex-girlfriend and I had told her that I have had sex before. When I told her the truth, as we started seeing each other seriously, she was visibly upset and emphasized repeatedly that one shouldn't lie unnecessarily. However, she said that she might sometimes say a lie because she wouldn't want to discuss certain past events with anyone and assured me that such past events will not affect us in any way. It sounded very fair and I was so happy how forthcoming she was, which I never could be. I thanked her for being honest and told her that I would respect her past and she can tell me whenever she is comfortable, but I had demanded that if anything from the past continues to affect her present, she should be completely open with her.

Later after a week, she told me that her dad had committed suicide a few years back when she had started with college, and said that she would never want to discuss it again. I was so happy that she trusted me and told me such a traumatic event and I just started loving her even more. We started discussing our childhood, about how and where we grew up, etc. She had told me once that she had a boyfriend, but this time when I asked about her romantic life, she said she was in love with a guy who was her senior in the college and that there were many traumatic events in that which she doesn't want to discuss. She said that he used to leave her saying some bullshit reasons for a few days when she has slowly accepted it after a few days, he would come back to her and claim that he did it to make her stronger. Sounded pretty abusive to me, but I pressed for details about her sex life too. She said that she once had sex with him four years back and that was the only time she had sex before. Though I felt a little disappointed, I never thought of it as a big deal and forgot about it in a few days.  

Days passed, and we practically started living together. Since my place has hardly enough place for one, I suggested we stay at her place for a few days as they have a decent 2BHK apartment and her parents were in a distant land with XX's elder sister. On second day morning in her place, when I was leaving for work, I found that my bike's tyres were flattened and then some men came to me and started shouting and threatening in some language I didn't understand. They were speaking in Hindi, and when called my girlfriend down to the parking basement, I understood what was going on. Those people were her neighbours, commonly called as [Uncle/Unkil](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8pxtmf/what_is_an_unkil/), and they came to question and threaten me because I am some stranger who is taking advantage of a poor girl living near them. When she pleaded them to drop the matter, they raised their voice even more and wanted to call XX's mom and police (I have no idea why.) Somehow we managed to get out of there, and we formed an even closer bond with each other. That day, she pleaded with them saying that it was all her fault and responsibility and asked them to let me go. I just wanted to fight them and make them call the police, but she controlled me too and avoided a bigger scene. I was so moved by what she did and how she cared for me.   
Later, after a few days, she said that she has never let anyone else in her home when her parents aren't there and that I was too special, etc.   

She had earlier told me that she never had belief in marriage, but after that incident and when I found that what I mean to her, I got the full courage to ask her to marry me. She said that she would be happy to, as, for her, marriage is nothing more than a license that let her stay without me, without being questioned by her family and society. We started living as husband and wife, and she wanted to get married immediately. It was November and her family was planning to come back to town in December, so I just wanted to wait and then inform both of our family and then marry.
December came, her mom and elder sister came, and she started living with them, and we started seeing less of each other, however, we started video calling each other.  

Now let me break and tell something else. When she was living with me, two guys used to call her regularly and whenever they call, she used to get very upset, sullen and gloomy. When I pressed, she said they are her exes, one is the guy whom she was with for four years during college, and the other guy is whom she dated after college for a few months though she had known him from school. I had repeatedly advised her to cut off connection with them as she clearly didn't feel very good whenever they called. We had very long discussions about how one of them cheated on her and the other one continuously abused her for years.  

Cutting to mid-December, one evening I was missing her badly and asked her to come on a video call and for four hours, she maintained that she is talking to her sister and mom and that she will not be able to call me. After a few days, I *happen to stumble upon her google location history* and found that she was indeed outside somewhere till 11 PM that night when she claimed to have been talking to her sister, and that wasn't the only night. She then claimed that she had met her ex on one of the night because it was his birthday and he was very lonely and that she came back home by 8 PM. And on the second night when she was out late, she was with her sister. She cried and said that she will stop all communications with her exes and asked me to not leave her. I didn't have much ground to believe her, but I tried my best to believe her because I wanted to.

Days went on. I started pushing her to speak to her family and get a nod for our marriage and she started speaking to them every day about it with so much conviction. She did that for two months and by February, their family agreed, but my dad wasn't okay with it due to some stupid thing called caste. But something else was happening too.
In January, she started fighting for every small thing and started asking me to leave her. Those were some of the most traumatic weeks of my life as I was feeling like I was walking on glass shreds with bare feet. Every week, she would ask me to leave her at least three times; and I ended up begging her and running behind to make her stay. Sometimes, I would just leave my work and take the bike and go wherever she is, and maybe that's my second biggest mistake. Maybe one should let people go when they wanted to leave.

Then I found that she is still talking to her first ex, though she didn't send flirting or any such texts. But XX's ex kept on telling XX that she is responsible for his pain and sorrow and that he missed a lot of potential brides who wanted to marry him by paying a hefty dowry because of her and that his life is spoiled. (some fucked up shit) He tried to make her feel shitty and guilty and oh boy, he did succeed. Every time I found about her talking to him, she said some story or other, like once he asked money to pay for his college and she felt the need to help, and once he called from a different number and told someone in the family died or sometimes he messaged her on some weird way, such as a payment app and asked her to unblock him on WhatsApp etc. But every time she kept making the promises to me that she would stop talking to him and block him permanently, but that never seemed to be the case. I started checking her phone, her call logs, messages, her phone notification logs, etc. and every time I checked and caught her, she made the same promises and instead of keeping the promises, started covering her tracks. So, for example, once I confront her with notification logs, next time, that will be cleared and the same was the case with call history and on.
And one more thing, she always said that she never did anything wrong by letting her Ex talk to her or by her talking to them because ""she does not have any feeling towards them and there is nothing wrong in simply talking to a person and helping them when they need her."" I can understand such a strong feeling she has towards him. They got close at the time her dad died and she was very close to her dad. Maybe she found his company as something that kept her thoughts away from her dad's memories. XX's is the worst piece of shit I can imagine. When this poor girl was suffering from such a loss of her dear father, this bastard made her stop talking to her cousins who were trying to help a mourning kid by taking out to movies, shops, etc.

In March-end, when I found that she is still talking to him, I reached a breaking point one day and told her that we are breaking up, but when she cried, I called her ex to scold him and warn him. But when I called him, he started scolding me and her and said a slightly different story. Now, XX had told me that she broke up with this guy in 2017 and that she had sex with him only once long back and that she never let anyone in her home etc. But when XX's ex started speaking and shouting on the phone, I somehow managed to extract more and more information from him.
If I were to believe him, though she said that she didn't want to date him anymore in 2017, they were regularly seeing each other till December and sleeping together regularly and he also said that he had been to her home just a month before I and XX met and that incident with her neighbours occurred.XX was so angry and worried that I talked to her ex, and started telling me to leave. She called her ex and I guess she just scolded him for saying things to me.
I didn't want to believe whatever her ex said, so I told her something like: ""Baby, don't worry. If you are okay, we can get married right away. I know that he is very manipulative and he lies so often. I don't want to believe him. Moreover, those are your past and you didn't cheat on anyone. It was all before we met. And you had always said that you never felt wrong talking to him, so you did not do anything wrong in your own right. blah blah blah.""
But I wasn't able to take my mind off from those thoughts that she probably lied to me about her past. I asked her whether she actually just slept with him once, etc. which made her very upset. She started crying etc, but I was feeling distant. So I saw a shrink (via video call due to this pandemic) who suggested a couples' session.
In that session, when I told that I am looking for answers and that she broke promises, the therapist asked her, ""XX, OP has some trust issues. Do you want to say your side? What do you want to tell him to help him trust you?"" At this point, XX dropped off from the video call. So I called XX back after the session. She wanted to break up for a few minutes, but then after that, she started saying: "" *if you had these questions in mind, why did you give me the false hope a few days back? This is an emotional roller coaster. You gave me some hope, and now taking everything away. Moreover, you know about my relationship with my mom, and how hard I struggled every day to convince them for this marriage. Now they are just waiting for me to get married so that they can get rid of me. Now think about that too. If you were gonna do this, why did you force me to talk to my family? Every men are same. Why can't you love me for who I am? This is just like my previous relationship. Men will like if they see the good side, but once they see the other side, they will want to leave. Now that my family is waiting to get me married, let us get married and after a year, if you want, we can divorce.* ""


 Well, that day I was so adamant to leave, but after listening to her cry for about 12 hours, we decided to give it another try. Well, then after that we were trying. I couldn't get those thoughts out of my head, but I started ignoring those.

We again had some fight. Same shit. She even hurt herself this time. She hit her badly and cut her a bit. She wanted to die and she was feeling suicidal again. I just couldn't leave, though I tried very hard. We decided to try again.


Then one day, I was just teasing her about whether she has watched any porn ever, and she was maintaining that she never did. But I was doubtful, so I asked her to show the history. She refused. Then later that night, for downloading some large files via p2p network, I asked her to install qbittorrent, and *she had shared the screen* so that I can help her to add the torrent files and guide her through installation. She was sceptical to run the installer as windows had warned her against the file as potential malware, so I asked her to open the history to see the website she downloaded the installer file from. She was so adamant and told me to guide her on downloading the installer again. Then I thought something is fishy. We have shared each others' google password a while back, so I logged in to check the activity.  I did found a couple of instances of porn, but I just couldn't control but laugh. Then I also noticed that she has been visiting her Exes' social media profiles. So I said nothing. I just mentioned to her that we can see our google activity and find what sites we have been visiting.
In an hour, she deleted all the entries of stalking (and porn too.) Then I just couldn't believe that she still had to stalk them and take steps to hide those from me. When I confronted, she gave some stories as usual. We had a huge fight and then in the morning when I saw, she had already installed OKC. Since then we have activated two-factor authentication for our google accounts and I don't know what she is up to these days. But we do stay on video call with each other for most of the time every day, as we are now just stuck in our homes.
So last week, I was feeling bad and apologised to her profusely for asking whether she lied about having not slept with her Ex after they broke up and not inviting her ex to home just a month before we met. She got angry that time, but after several hours, she said that: *A month before she met me, since she stayed alone when she fell ill, she didn't know whom else to call and hence has called her Ex. When he came with medicines, he told her apparently that he is hard and unless he has sex, it won't go and it will be too uncomfortable for him and that it will start to pain. So she helped him and out and had sex.*  (Sound like he tried the classic porn movie plot and it worked for him!!! Whhat the actual fuck!!s)

------------

Anyway, I am not very sure if she loves me any more the way she used to.
She used to say I love you.
She used to call me baby.
Then it became dude.
Now, it is nothing. Just plain cold messaging.
But she keeps asking me every time whether I will marry her or not.
She so badly wants us to get married as soon as possible.

The reason I believe that she wants to marry me is not only that she loves me. Maybe she is just too worried about how she will handle her mom. Maybe XX is too invested in this relationship. Since she struggled a lot to convince her family, maybe she is afraid to go back and tell them that we had broken up and maybe that's why she is wanting to marry me?   

And though I want to believe and I almost know that she hasn't stalked her exes or contacted them in the last week, I don't know for sure. How could I? Every time I was sure in the past, I was proved wrong.  

Every time she comes online on WhatsApp, I wonder whom she is talking to. And I stay online often just to see, nowadays. And I even started trying to flirt with other people (though that was only for a couple of days out of spite). I started having some weird questions, such as ""If she had sex with him just a few months before, how dare did she to let me have unprotected sex with her? What if I got some STD such as AIDS from her Ex?""

------------

Anyway, now I promised her that I will marry her. But my mind says that if I marry her, I will spoil her life and that she deserves someone who can love her with all his heart.

But I cannot leave her too. All her neighbours and her family knows me, and in this country, that means, it will be impossible for her to find a groom. And I am really afraid that she will hurt herself again and might even do something stupid if I tell her I do not want to get married.



I don't know what I should do. :-/



If there is a way that I could work on my trust issues and these stupid questions in mind, and if I can just love her, there can be nothing like that. But as every day passes, I am losing hope. She still calls me regularly and spends time with me, but I always keep noticing some small things and I am just not being the person she deserves, lately.

I (28M) fell in love with this wonderful girl (24F) 7 months back, and we decided to get married.
I pushed her to talk to her family and with great effort, she convinced them.

And since the COVID-19 outbreak and all the isolation, it’s been making it a lot worse.

Here’s a little background:

My family consists of all Indians. My mom moved from India while all my siblings and I were born in the US. I (F19) live with my mom (M), my second eldest sister (SE) and my little brother (B). I have another older sister (OS) but she lives on her own. Lucky me, I’m a middle child that has depression and anxiety.

So here’s the situation, my family, when all of us were much younger, have been physically abusive. M would take out her anger on all of us. OS would do it to my other SE, me and B. SE would do it to me and B. I would do it to B and B to me. And if you’re thinking it’s just little quarrels, it wasn’t. It was full blown beating. My OS has actually taken each other my other siblings’ heads and mind and smashed it hard against the wall. And if we started to cry then she would hit us more and tell us to shut up otherwise she’d do worse. I’m not saying that what we did was right or that I’m proud of it, definitely far from it, but we’ve come a bit of a way to stop the physical abuse. And OS has come a long way and is a lot nicer than before. 

However, everyone has been, and still very are, emotionally abusive. Ever since I could remember my mom and siblings would call me fat, stupid, dumbass, retard, etc. And it just made it a lot worse that I had bullies at school doing and saying somewhat of the same things. Everyday it’s something or the other.

I have one thing though that absolutely ticks me off. Don’t touch me. When I was little, I was molested by someone I trusted for two years straight and I haven’t told anyone in my family about it. Hence the reason I don’t like been touched at all. Right now SE keeps grazing by me and pushing me with her body. Every time I tell her to stop she just starts laughing and goes “Oh, want me to do it again?” or “Stop being a baby” or something else to get me even more angry.

I yell at her to stop and M ends up yelling at me to stop arguing and yelling. M now has been yelling about me not leaving my room at all or doing anything around the house (I got laid off because of the pandemic). The whole reason I stay in my room (which I also share with SE) is so I don’t have to deal with any of them.

B hasn’t been too annoying just the occasional poking me but not too much.

The hardest part of this is it’s current Ramadan or the month of fast for Muslims. And my family all classify as Muslim (I don’t, I classify as Agnostic). I just don’t care for religion at all whatsoever. I’m so done with being forced to pray and do things for something I don’t really believe in. If you don’t know, Muslims have to pray 5 times a day so being home and not having anything else to do, I can’t avoid it.

Some of you might be wondering “it’s just praying, it doesn’t take that long, just do it and get it over with”. I do and it’s really getting to my head because what’s the point at all when I don’t even believe in it. I mean how would you feel if you were of a certain religion and someone forces to the pray as another?

But anyways, I really wanna ask what I should do, I’ve voiced my concerns and no one’s listening. Considering my depression, it’s been getting worse and I’ve been having major self harming thoughts again. Any advice?",2020.0,5.0,19.0,14:48:37,abuse,19
151,7,7,Am I in an abusive relationship?,3.0,gdsijt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gdsijt/am_i_in_an_abusive_relationship/,7.0,1588688674.0,"My girlfriend (20 F) and I (20 M) have been dating for about a year and a half now. We both study at the same college and that's where we met as freshman.

So initially when we started dating, she told me this event that happened in her past that caused her to not be quite outgoing. But, when she came to college, she found a nice group of people to call her friends. 

As time passed, she had differences with her group and eventually seperated from them. Eventually it reached a point where I was the only person whom she talked with. I was still being myself and hanging out with my friends and I'd spend some time with her in the evening.

One day she just bursts out crying and I'm trying to understand why, when she says that she's all alone and that I wouldn't understand because I have other friends. So I suggested that if she didn't like her old friends and that their differences couldn't be put aside that there were a lot of good people with whom she'd feel pretty comfortable. She just asked me not to interfere with her stuff. Eventually, I left it to her as I felt she wasn't comfortable talking about it.

A few months later, we were supposed to go home for our internship break and both of us were busy with our work. I'd call her at the end of each day hoping we'd talk like we'd used to in college. I'd start a conversation and she'd just say that she's tired or sleepy and just reply with ""Hmmmm"" whenever I was saying something. This went on for about a month. I thought it was just a phase that she's probably struggling with feeling alone and I asked if she needed to talk or needed my help. She declined and asked me not to interfere with her ""issues"".

In college there was a period of time where I got really busy with this event we were organising, and it was a national event, for which we prepared for like a week and half. I would often have to work late so couldn't see her as often. I'd make efforts to see her after class but she'd be tired and would just go up to her room. During the end of the week she started saying that I don't give her enough time and that my work was more important.

Since this whole lockdown (COVID-19 India) thing has begun, the same thing has been happening. She's never been to a therapist, although I did suggest it a number of times. During this lockdown, I've begun to notice that whenever I'm trying to have a conversation, she's trying to have an argument. She's quite condescending when we talk and doesn't contribute to the conversation at all. When I ask her if something is wrong, she'll brush it off with ""nothing"". At first I thought I was doing something wrong and that it was all somehow my fault.

I am slightly an introvert, so all these social media platforms kinda don't always make sense to me and used to prefer to keep my life off of social media platforms. It was my friend's birthday recently and I'm trying to become more active on social media, so I posted a story wishing him a happy birthday. She immediately responded by asking me why her birthday story was on my close friends list instead of on my normal story. She also followed it by saying that she's not jealous and that she was ""genuinely curious"".

But lately, even though I try to be as supportive of her mental illness as possible, she still is very condescending and keeps using her mental illness to justify this behaviour. A few of days ago, I said ""I love you"" and waited for a response. She didn't say it back. When I asked her about it, she said that ""I'm not comfortable saying it"" even though she's said it almost everyday before. She hasn't said it since then, even though we talk every day.

Am I in an emotionally abusive or draining relationship? If yes, should I break up with her? I'm not aware of these things, kindly excuse my ignorance if I've somehow said something inappropriate",2020.0,5.0,5.0,20:09:34,abuse,20

Not sure if I should give some quick background? My husband (38M) and I (34F) have a really good relationship and are open to talking to each other about things to resolve issues. We do this regularly, we approach disagreements from the standpoint that we are a team want the best for each other. We've been married almost a year. He is from India and has lived in US for almost 10 years, where we live now.  I have been in bad and abusive relationships in the past and have been working *really* hard at being healthy, and he's been really supportive and overall things are awesome. 

\---

I ate lunch today and left some condiments on my plate. He had eaten previously, but entered the room when I was finishing my meal. He asked me why I took so much achar (a pickled condiment). ""I thought I wanted it, but I didn't."" I shrugged, thinking nothing of it. 

And here's where it begins: ""You waste so many things."" Was that his exact wording? Hard to say, I know he didn't use the words 'always' or 'everything'. 

\[I almost didn't include this, but in the interest of honestly, I said something sarcastic here. He tried to change the situation and asked what I was watching on TV. I said I was just wasting my time like everything else. Yeah, that was pretty passive aggressive and not cool, I know. He grabbed his plate of fruit we were sharing, yelled something and stormed out of the room. He brought the fruit plate when he joined me after my meal. He came back 20 mins later, apologetic for his behavior, and the conversation continued, more or less as follows.\]

""What do you mean, its only achar, its only a little bit and we've had it forever and neither of us eat it."" 

""Its so many other things, I don't want to get into it, but you should be mindful of these things."" After some bewildered questioning on my part, he gave another example. ""You leave butter on the knife after putting it on bread."" He tells me that I should wipe the remaining butter off the knife with my finger. Of course this would also apply to peanut butter, jelly, and the like. 

I think this is silly. and tell him so, expecting it to end there. Lets agree to disagree, its a tiny thing.  
Nope. 

Remember we just participated in this marriage seminar by a couple we mutually respect, and they said that some things aren't worth discussing, we don't agree, but it doesn't really matter so why bother.   
Nope. ""That applies to things like where you want to put the furniture. Not to being wasteful.""

Ok then maybe it is about something else? Not just about butter on a knife?   
Nope. ""If I have some feedback I am going to tell you.""

At this point I am thinking he is being a bit anal. I'm wondering if he has some OCD.  I am wondering if it is cultural, like, ""typical American waste, when I was growing up we didn't waste a thing"". But that is a lot of speculation.  I tried to use these tools, ""what I understand is ...."" etc.  

He says I ""don't see a value in the things, when everything has a value."" Also its God's spiritual energy. 

So it seems to me there are certain things that would go along with that, ""is this an ongoing issue, does he think *I* am wasteful? If I am not seeing value in things, am I not being respectful? Am I being disrespectful to you, as the provider of said things? or God?"" I'm not upset, I'm calm, I am legitimately trying to understand where he is coming from and why this is a problem.

He storms off again, says that I always do this, make a big thing out of nothing, trying to put so many words in his mouth and coverings on the problem. I never take any criticism. Or something like that. 

I really don't know what to say, does he expect that I just accept and do whatever he says? I don't really know what the problem is, except that it isn't just pickle. I know that I made mistakes in this conversation also. I didn't get a chance to apologize for my sarcasm before he stormed off again.  I would really appreciate any insight because I am not sure if I am being reasonable. Like I mentioned before, I was in pretty terrible relationships before so I am more likely to accept all the blame for things, apologize and move on, but I don't think that not wiping butter off the knife before washing it is wasteful or caused by a lack of mindfulness. I think that's stupid. 

Please give me some advice on what happened and how to proceed. Also, if this post should be somewhere else or is too long I'm sorry, please advise.

&#x200B;

Get cozy folks and get ready for a lot of context. 

So my little brother I’ll call D is a self-proclaimed stoner. He started smoking the weed while at high school, in one of the most prestigious international schools in Europe. He managed to graduate with ok grades and a lot of very high achieving friends. 

He is intelligent but he’s a man of simple pleasures and has never been much of a high achiever, he lacks curiosity and drive. At the dinner table after school, we would ask him, so how was your day? His reply was always ‘…good.’ We would have to dig to get anything else from him. Meanwhile, the rest of us would have  conversations about our lives and about science, current affairs, politics and occasionally arts and literature, he would listen but wasn’t one to have an opinion or really engage by asking us any questions. 

For context: This is very unlike the rest of my family and extended family. My older brother and my father, who are both highly intellectual high achievers, and my mother, who can hold her own in any conversation and is interested in learning new things. I myself have always been very curious about all kinds of stuff, love discussing ideas and now have a fulfilling career. 

D did develop a few interests while at school which have not changed since graduating university: weed, drinking, football, board games/videogames and french rap, ( he listens to this exclusively,) which he identifies a lot with because I guess he feels very different from us, angry and misunderstood. Anyway, I tried showing him all kinds of music as he grew up and didn’t seem all that phased by it. 

D is usually charming and funny and a nice guy to be around but he’s never been very passionate or excited about a subject at school and was he type of kid that cared more about being popular and making girls laugh than getting involved in class.  His mentality is often focused on what the bare minimum he needs to do to pass would be. 

His communication skills are rather poor in the sense that he’s not very communicative about how he feels, what he does, or what bothering him, and feels cornered when we ask him anything. He also never tells us about any of his interests, but this might be because he knows we can’t relate to french rap and belated teenage angst. 

He was the class clown and became fairly popular in schoo… but when it comes to what he wants to do with his life.. he’s never had a very strong voice guiding him anywhere until he worked for a charity in India, and started liking the idea of working in developing countries. He does have a big heart and enjoys travelling so he figured why not?

He graduated in 2019 from a university in a different european country than the one he grew up in (we all live here now)… he disliked the studying, smoked weed constantly and had a harder time making friends due to the culture clash and his maybe some language barriers as its not his dominant language. (We all speak three languages as we’ve moved around a lot as a family but he’s definitely a lot more fluid speaking in one over the others)  Last september he moved back in with my parents and I. 

I really REALLY never expected that he would smoke while living with us… I would be so ashamed to smoke under my parents roof (you’d get it if you met them, they’re very ‘dignified’ people) and they’ve always run a tight ship. But the situation has been a huge problem ever since he moved in. He started smoking in his room, out the window, nightly. Then my parents found out and said he couldn’t smoke under their roof, so he started going for walks and smoking. At first just in the evenings after he thought they’d gone to sleep.

SIDE NOTE: You might think, what’s the big deal? The kid smokes some weed. I won’t speak for my parents as they have their reasons (they worry its a gateway drug amongst other things) but for me, personally, I do not trust the weed in London. Its like 99.99% skunk weed… and I’ve been reading online about the latest research and skunk really fucks with your brain. It has a huge neurological impact which, if abused the way he abuses it, could lead to long term damage. It also increases your chances of developing psychosis by a lot… 

It also serves as a massive crutch for him - he doesn’t deal with problems (clearly he’s got some deep seated shit he doesn’t know how to deal with) he just smokes and doesn’t have to feel inadequate or stressed or anything. 

My other reason for being against it is because I’ve been there - I was dependent on it for about 4 months at university, smoking daily and I remember how much it fucked with my motivation, short term memory, my mood, and it made me develop a extremely lame stoner sense of humour which is only funny to other stoners. 

&#x200B;

Since realising how hard getting a good job is (cause it requires, you know, effort and developed communication skills) and ESPECIALLY after lockdown, he’s been going out to smoke at least 3 fat blunts of extremely strong weed (I know because I took like 4 tokes one night and got uncomfortably high) every day. So at this point in the story he is either cranky and withdrawn from coming off it or very stoned. 

A little side note: he defends his smoking by saying its his ‘lifestyle’ that its ‘legal in many countries’ and that he doesn’t have any negative reactions to it. Because he’s so uncommunicative its hard to tell if he’s self-aware, in touch with his emotions and if he actually believes this. He is extremely stubborn and doesn’t want to believe anything we say because my parents ‘havent even tried it so how would they know’ and I’m ‘a woman with hormones so I reacted to it completely differently than he does’ 

Living with him started becoming extremely tense because of his constant mood swings, rudeness, lack of communication and his laziness and all our constant worrying. At the dinner table he looks down miserably at his food and hardly speaks and feels cornered if we ask him stuff.  Now we don’t ask him anything or try to involve him in any conversation. Meanwhile, my father is the sole breadwinner (I don’t have a job because of covid) and D is unenthusiastically completing programming courses online without ever telling us what his game plan is when the economy reopens. 

He basically eats with us but gets up and leaves straight after. Also, we live in a small apartment with parents who are 60+ and his constant coming and going put us on edge for months as he kept forgetting to wash his hands. He keeps getting pissed off that we keep ’telling him how to live’ for reminding him to take basic precautions. This led to A LOT of fighting. He basically rages with everyone demanding privacy and its been a bitch getting him to pull his own weight around the house. 

This all came to a head one day about a month ago when he physically pushed my mom out of his room one day when she came in to talk to him. My father put his foot down and told him that if he didn’t quit smoking, he had to go (yes, in the middle of quarantine) This finally shook him - He has managed to bring it down to one joint or two in the evenings again… and he’s somewhat on thin ice as he’s supposed to have quit if he wants to stay but as his behaviour has improved, my dad is cutting him some slack. 

&#x200B;

ANYWAY THIS BRINGS US TO LAST NIGHT, when I walked in on him rolling a joint. He looked at me and said “This is my last one. I’ve run out of weed anyway.” I told him, ok, how about you start smaller and quit for a week? He said ok. I was like, cool, so you promise you’ll quit for a week? He said yes.

&#x200B;

Tonight, I heard his telltale sneak out of the door. I opened the window to my room and I called out: Hey so how about the promise? He started complaining that he would do it next week, that he had a bit of tobacco left he wanted to use.  I tried to be very delicate and soft with my tone, showing love and concern instead of frustration. Eventually I said something like,  what is your word worth if you can’t even keep a promise to yourself? That did make him stop and deflate and think. He sat down against the wall outside to think and became withdrawn. I tried to convince him that the label he had given himself was just a label and that his cravings should go away in a few days if he stands firm in just trying to quit for at least a week. He said he’s felt cravings even after stopping for two weeks. He said that this is just who he is. But he said these things with all the giddy wind knocked out of his sails (I almost felt guilty he looked so lost)  

&#x200B;

I managed to coax him back up, by asking him to just try for one week to see if he can do it. He went straight to his room. I asked if I could come in, he said yes, and I told him I could help him if we wanted to talk, if he wanted to come up with an action plan to try learning a new skill or something when the cravings hit. He just said no, its fine. 

&#x200B;

My issue is, I really want to help and support him but he doesn’t let me in (its especially hard now as we’re all sick of seeing each other in confinement) He’s always had a big chip on his shoulder about asking for help - he never wants it - he’s got this stupid ‘manhood’ thing where he thinks it makes him weak to depend on others. He never wants to talk - I dont think he knows how to ‘dig deep’ unless he’s high. But I don’t see how he can start to change if he can’t verbalise how he’s feeling, ever - because he’ll never be able to tackle the issues that he’s running away from. Most worrying of all, I think the reason he likes weed so much is that in ‘unlocks’ curiosity in him - something he doesn’t seem to feel much when he’s sober.

&#x200B;

What can I do to help him ? 

&#x200B;

TL;DR

I am worried my introverted brother - a proudly self professed stoner - is ruining his life with his addiction to Marijuana. This all came to a head last month when he physically pushed my mom out of his room and my dad threatened to kick him out. He seems increasingly withdrawn and I don't know how to help him.",2020.0,5.0,22.0,15:54:21,abuse,29

I am a 23yr old Indian female. Well atleast my parents did no. Of abortions to make sure only a boy was born. But then a point came, where doctor told them that they can't concieve again if they aborted me. So with no resort , they had to give birth to me.

My relatives from both the side are same. On one side, my father's side they are thug and earns money by illegally capturing lands of innocent and giving them death threats. On other hand my mother's family is highly educated, but with even worse mentality. They think girls have no right at all. They have even killed new born baby girls and thrown them in river as they are useless. Just marry at 17 or 18 itself and make babies.

My parents have been highly controlling. they want to decide everything for me, how I sit talk, think, eat , sleep. Basically be their puppet. They are so much caste-centric, that even if the opposite person is of the same religion, they will dig down deeper to find the caste, his/her hometown ( which also be the same as ours, same goes for gender) and only then he or she can be a friend. But that's just not possible in today's world. I have always been a topper in my class and have done internships at prestigious institute like IIT, and even gone abroad on my very first full time job role. But none of that makes them happy. They say they want me to have atleast 4 babies, and get me married. 

They have started looking for a guy. It doesn't even matter if he or she is earning less than 15,000 INR monthly, or is uneducated and have no schooling, they would marry me off for money and basically because I am an headache to them. And a bad omen in their life. On the other hand I am earning 5X the guys they are looking for me. 

My parents just crib about the past of how things happened here and there like 30 yrs ago and keep crying over the same thing. There hasn't been a day where I have smiled or be happy. They say all the bad things happening in their life is because of me. They blame anyone friend or colleague they know from my life out of home, saying the have manipulated me.

But unlike them I don't care for caste, religion, gender, whether the person drinks or smoke even if I don't. I work at ngo, leave away from them, have my own pets ( well they have problem with that as well) . They want me to give all my salary to them and they will decide where I should spend. Well I would be happy to do that but only if they stopped acting the way they are. 

I was 3 yr old when they threw me outside the house for not eating the last piece of food. I kept crying, but no one came to help me. It was thundering and raining the whole night, snakes passed beside me. I was so afraid. I still get that day in my nightmare. They have been trying to stop my studies from 5th grade it self. 

For the last 8 yrs when I moved out of home for my further studies after lots of fight at home, I have tried to keep everything of my life off the grid from them. But now they say they doubt I have a bf and I m trying to run away with him and some many things that I just can't write. In the mean time I have got certain genetic disorders, which they say because of my own sin of being a girl's and not being their puppet. They compare everything with money. They don't have a single friend of their own. Everywhere they go they get into fight with no particular reason. They hate every other religion to such an extent that they can be caught by police for spreading such hatred. 

All I want to do it study a bit more, get one more degree, travel to few places, not be a frog in a well who knows nothing about the outside world like them, help others and make my own decisions. How can someone who is educated and has a very forward thinking settle with guys like they are looking who are very narrow minded for them women is dustbin. Their family beat their wives to remove frustration from work or just for fun. I am not going to bear that i am independent. And I can take decision of my own. Giving birth to someone and actually becoming the child's parents is 2 different things. Like apple and oranges. 

If you don't do what they say, they will start abusing, this has led me to depression and reduced productivity. I have tried everything in the world to make them understand. They are even manipulate by relatives who have the same thinking about girl child. I understand, according to Indian society I should take care of them during old age, and I have no problem with that, but not like this. They say they will stay with me after marriage also. And decide how I should behave with my husband, and they will even decide my child's future, I apparently have no right to decide anything, I should be grateful that I am born. 


 I just want to go out of country, I am trying to get into a good college but that seems to be on hold due to on going pandemic in the world. the nearest possibility is next year. 

-I don't want to file a police complaint or anything, coz I think that might affect my college admission ( I am not sure please shed some light on this).

- I also want to know if they can legally call me back to India, once I move out. 

- are there any services or groups that can help me move out.",2020.0,5.0,2.0,20:13:43,abuse,23
155,11,11,Advice about trust/mutual friends (couple of 2.5+ yrs),1.0,fukmef,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fukmef/advice_about_trustmutual_friends_couple_of_25_yrs/,8.0,1585991617.0,"Hi, 

I’m F[21] and have been a lot of resentment towards my partner about his habit of lying. He tends to lie about many things, both trivial and big matters, over a long period of time. For example, about almost a year into our relationship, I found out he went to a different college within the university in his first year and transferred in his second year. All along, he made jokes about how lame the other college is and left no hints that he went there. 

He tends to lie/hide his hang-outs with other female friends as well. We had many many long conversations (each conversation after a different hang-out with a different female friend). All these female friends are mutual friends with both and him so most of the time, we as a couple hang out together with that friend(s). However, when he hung out individually with them in settings that i found very uncomfortable with (dinner, lunch at restaurants with just two of them), he would not share that with me after. I would find out about it when I saw the other friend’s message (I would ask them what they did/were doing, then they said I just got lunch with David (changed my bf’s name)). Or I would see a picture in his camera roll and asked where it was and he would say it was from lunch with a female friend. Two of the female friends were, according to him, close friends, one of whom he had a slight crush on (always visits her when in town, she came over to his hotel room to meet/chat). One was from the same hometown, all 12 years of school, and at one point, they briefly dated (his camera roll was full of her snapchat pictures prior to meeting and dating me). The other two are my friends as well but older than me (same age with his). I mentioned many times with him that I’m comfortable with him hanging out with them but definitely not comfortable about him lying/hiding about it. I would appreciate transparency in making plans with people of opposite-sex, whether together or just him and then. It took him over a year to start being transparent about his and respected my feelings. But it kept happening again and somehow i found myself tirelessly re-explaining the rationale and my hurt feelings repeatedly. Sometime in these arguments, he would flatly refuse to stop lying/letting me know about these plans because he feels restricted if he has to do that. I would then reply that this is not restriction/lack of freedom, this is him respecting my personal boundaries. 

Another matter that he lies about was also conversations with his male friends, in which I think, are very much toxic masculinity content. He has many group chats with his Indian friends (he’s from India so I think, this background plays a part but again, I don’t want it to be an overgeneralization here). These group chat are named “gay boys”, which I found very uncomfortable with. At one point, I was added to the group chat and saw first hand, many jokes about races and women in general. For example, jokes/memes/remarks/comments about women go like this: Friend A: “make a sandwich for yourself”. My boyfriend would reply: “That’s a woman’s job.” Friend A would reply: “LOL”.  Another one about race can be black people or once, about my Asian “communist” identity which I just laughed it off, despite feeling weirded out. These group chats are very long (basically since high school) and active (new texts every day). I bet everyone is in a group chat but i find it very offensive when this kind of content is normalized and deemed “casual” and “chill”. I noticed that this kind of misogyny and toxic masculinity are also transferred into real life when my boyfriend makes jokes like these in real life and just “laughs it off” as well. 

The culmination of this was over this winter break in December. I went back home to Asia for 8 weeks and he went back home to India for 2 weeks, so we had a brief LDR. This break was traumatizing for me because he has long history of lack of communication (no expression of emotions, radio silence when supposed to be engaged in our talks about relationship, emotional numbness/freeze when I start being frustrated with his silence/lack of response). Things were fine over FaceTime until the day before Christmas, we got into a fight over FaceTime. He said that he would be online to talk to me at a certain time but he was very late and cancelled it last minute. This happened before in previous breaks and I told him that I’d appreciate a heads-up because of the time difference (my day is his night, vice versa). He would rarely do it and just drop me last minute, leaving me feel really surprised/offended in a way as if he doesn’t respect my time. This break, I personally was going through a lot of personal issues (family abuse between parents, feeling out of place back home, reverse culture shock, loss of the only group of close friends in hometown) so I didn’t have anyone to talk to throughout 8 weeks. From his side, he dropped the phone call and made me very mad so I yelled on the phone later on. Before going back home, he said that he would try his best but can’t guarantee because he’s only home for 2 weeks and wants to spend time with his family. I said, that’s ok but if last minute cancel, he needs to let me know because I’m going through a tough time and needs that call with him once every 2-3 days. So after he dropped the call, he disappeared for 5 days and left me super confused/mad. His family was going through a tough time as well. His mom was kicked out of the house by his grandparents and got involved in a lawsuit. They were looking for a new place. His dad and his mom were getting to the verge of divorce, they are separated too. His sister is going through a rowdy teenager phrase. I knew this before and kind of focused on just myself and my issues back home. 

He came back 5 days later and wrote me a long message saying that he was diagnosed with critical PTSD by a psychiatrist - he got into a panic attack in the car when he got into a fight with me. I called him and he picked up and crying. We had a very emotional talk about his childhood/ptsd from our relationship - i cried a lot and wrote things down on my notebook. However, a few days later, over the course of 8 weeks, his attitude completely changed to being very hostile towards me. He said he wants to break up and will break up, without explaining why. I was left knees-deep in depression and anger. I would call him so many times, texted him, and he would not reply at all. Radio-silence. This hurt me so much to a point that i would spend all nights crying (3 weeks) and slept in the morning. I texted his friends, mostrefused to hear me out because they don’t want to be in the middle. At one point i was so hurt and feeling abandoned with no one to talk to, i asked his friend if they can stop talking to him for a week so that he feels what he was making me go through. In response to this, everyone reacted negatively and told my boyfriend that I’m being very crazy, without even knowing what i was going through myself. Please note, this is the same group of male friends in the group chats above. One of them texted my bf and said: “block her everywhere, ignore her, she will come crying and email you, ignore that too - you’re definitely over her, stop giving a fuck”. This remark, which i found out on my own later on, hits me at my core because to me it’s treating very disposable and brings hints of toxic misogyny/belittling woman. The worst thing was that my bf replied: “yeah i guess”...

I don't even know how to start, so I just started from the very beginning. I haven't spoken to anyone about this, except my wife, and I feel I am just damaging her and tearing away at the trust and love she had for me. Starting March 2019, I told her I didn't know if I really had loved her. I've told her 2 more times, late September 2019 and right before my match day, I was March 18 2020. These last two times came out as proclamations for divorce rather than just doubt and feeling uncertain. We have no kids, but I promised her a life of fulfilling her own grad school dreams and eventually having kids together... 

&#x200B;

I met my wife at McDonald's in Jacksonville, FL, our hometown. We were both 18, and both went to the University of North Florida. She was studying astrophysics and I was pre-med.  
Throughout the first couple of years I think things were great. We would study a lot together, watched similar shows, read similar books, had similar tastes of music.  
Around year 3, I started getting a lot of doubt, and I have never mentioned any of this doubt to her until last March. I did not know if I even still ""loved"" her, though I continued to say ""I love you"", though these words coming from my mouth would start to feel less and less genuine, as if I had to say it under a muttered breath or with a difficult swallow preceding it. Again, she didn't notice any of this, and has always said ""I love you"" to me several times a day and before bed, and it has always felt genuine from her.  
We have had moments lying in bed together throughout these  2-4 years where she would sit up and look me in the eyes and say ""what is it about me that you love? Why do you love me?"" I would not know how to answer. I would lock up and freeze, almost because I have been asking myself that same question... What is it that I ""love"" about you, do I even love you?..... I had never been with anyone else before, is this what love is supposed to feel like? Are there different gradients of love that exist on a spectrum, and I just don't know where my current relationship falls because I lack experience. Perhaps it could be better, perhaps it could be worse.  
I proposed to her after 4 years. Before the wedding, I would cry in my bed at night trying to go to sleep, thinking about how I just locked myself in to a relationship when I wasn't sure if I'd ever love anyone again... I kept telling myself ""this is what religious people do (I am not religious). This is what cultures do in the middle east and in India, they get arranged marriages and stay together, they're told to suck it up and deal with it. You'll learn to ""love"" her again...""  
 We were moving away to TN so that I could start medical school, and she would follow me there, committed to stay together for each other. ""We"" applied broadly together, and wound up choosing TN because there was a graduate school here where she can pursue astrophysics.... That never worked out. She ""mis-bubbled"" her Physics GRE and had an abominable score, and no longer pursued higher education.   
I guess I still feel some resentment for that, but I also feel apathetic about it. It is what it is. I've landed a fantastic residency and I did magnificent on my boards. Did I desire to be in rural TN? No. But I have to say they've provided me with a fantastic education and IDK if I'd change that!  
We traveled to Europe together and to Las Vegas together as part of our trips during the first 2 years of medical school (trust me, I had very little free time. This was during the summer).  I cried in Las Vegas from a petty fight about using a public bus. It was very bizarre, crying for hours that night, and it seemed odd and disproportionate to the inciting event. The truth is, it was from my ""doubt"" that just kept eating away at my thoughts. That night was ruined, and left her feeling perplexed. I've had many more fights with her during this time frame (years 5-7), and I get more and more enticed by the idea of just letting the relationship die and having us separate. I feel like I started getting passive aggressive with her, in hopes of her noticing that I am not happy, and she would be the one to feel disconnected, uncertain, and ready to serve me the papers rather than the other way around. To this day, I wonder if I would cry or feel sad if SHE was the one to hand me the papers. In my head, I imagine just being elated and saying ""about dang time, what a relief!"" But is that really what I want?   
Now since March of last year (which I wrote about in my previous message), I feel like my desires, doubt, and uncertainty are all just amplified. There is not a single day, not a single hour, where I don't think about this ""Are we really happy together? Am I happy together? Would I be happier single? Would I be happier with another partner?""  
It has gotten to the point where I fantasize about cheating on her in many different ways, or fantasize about her cheating on me, just so I can turn it around and have an excuse to leave her.  
Her parents recently got divorced, just in June 2019, she found out that her father had been cheating on her mom for the past 17 years. Her father did not express any remorse, and said he had been trying to leave her for years, and just did not want to ""hurt"" her mother emotionally. He said he has felt ""dead inside"" for years, and finally couldn't take it anymore and cheated on her, since he held nothing sacred in his relationship.  
I wonder if I relate to him to an extent, just fantasizing about cheating on her, finding a new love, or just severing our ties and ripping the band-aid ... This family divorce has been devastating for my wife, she doesn't even speak to her mother or father anymore,  she has been physically and emotionally abused by both of them for many years, up until she met me at age 18 in fact.  
For the last 2 years, I haven't even been able to say ""I love you"" anymore.  I feel this wave of nausea when I say it back to her, and feel like I am about to start crying. When we lie down together and I hold her, I don't feel the ""warmth"" i used to feel, its the same as holding a pillow, and it gives me so much distress and anxiety that I cannot fall asleep at times, and I turn and face the other way.  
The past 2 years, I have started to ask that she wear makeup again, even though we are doing nothing in the apartment and not going out. I have become severely unattracted to her without makeup in these last 2 years, which never really was an issue for me before.   
Now, since before match day, March 18 2020, I have been having waves of conflicting thoughts, and I wonder if they are genuine, or if they just emerge from the guilt from my last ""divorce"" talk with her. On a daily basis now, my opinion changes... I go to sleep uncertain and doubtful, I wake up sad and with the same feelings, but throughout the day I start feeling better and can imagine a future together. During this sudden change in heart, I want to invest in US together, I want to support her emotionally and want her in my life... But then it starts to die down at the end of the day, and I am hit with the uncertainty again, and the anxiety and doubtful thoughts return. 

I have read through her messages on her phone, and I already know its the wrong thing for me to do, an invasion of her privacy, but I almost feel apathetic about it. She has one great friend that has always been there for her in Jax. She has always been supportive of her, and tells her the right things: ""You need to leave while you can, don't have kids with this man, you deserve better, you deserve to be loved the way you love too, you shouldn't have to wear makeup in your own damn apartment, F\*ck this guy."" I read this and think ""I know deep down she is right, I think I should just rip this band-aid and end this relationship. She deserves better.""

  
Our sex life has always been great, she fulfills all of my sexual desires and I am obsessed with her body. We have sex multiple times a week...... Still, I imagine being with other women frequently, and will even fantasize about other women I know even right after having sex.  

 I guess I opened the floor with a little more background. Hope it wasn't too excessive, just wanted you to have the best and clearest understanding of what I've been going through. It sucks the most just bottling it up and not speaking to anyone about it.",2020.0,4.0,20.0,07:00:42,abuse,18

I am not sure if I am a toxic person or if I'm just caught up in a toxic relationship that brings out the worst in me. I have been with my wife for all of seven years. We lived in for 4 years and are now married for three. From the very beginning, when we started dating, I noticed how she would get abusive and would make the most hurtful remarks about my ethinicity, family, where I was raised etc. This obviously would lead to me losing my top and giving it back to her with the same vengence and ferocity as was bestowed upon me. I know full well that what I did was wrong. However, what I soon realised was that she would take my reaction and turn it around on me and tell me I have anger issues that I need help and that this was all my fault. At first this only aggravated me further because...although I was willing to take responsibility for my actions, she continued to behave as if my actions were not justified. I am no Mahatama Gandhi to turn a cheek and let the person slap you on the other side, and that may be my fault. During these years of living in together we she has always been the one to start hurling caustic and personal remarks on me, my family and everything else in between. I am okay with using abuses because that's just how we speak when we are angry but the creativity and information that is used to say the sickest most disturbing things to a person is where I draw the line. And that line doesn't seem to exist with her. I always had my doubts about marrying her but then...we lived in together for 3 years and I eventually felt like I wouldn't find anyone better...that I have invested so much time and effort in this relationship that it would be best to go ahead with things and maybe the relationship would see a change after we married. It's not like I didn't love her. I was just scared that it would end up in a divorce with the way things were and decided to not tie the knot as quickly as I had earlier expected. The time we were living in was not just one with verbal abuse but physical abuse as well. She would raise her hand on me and throw shit at me and I would react. I would hit back, although not as hard as she would but I couldn't help it but to fight back. Was I wrong in doing so...I know I was. Was I wrong in fighting back I don't personally think so. Have I had this issue in any of my multiple other relationships? Not once! Physical violence never! Abuses to this extent...never. Am I guilty of my actions...Yes! Did I apologise...Yes! Could I forget...NO! 

Cut to chase and three years being married...I live in a diffrent city and she lives in her hometown. We moved there after getting married because she wanted to be closer to her single father. But I was on the verge of losing my job and got my salary infrequently so I decided to look for a better opportunity and found one in the city that we originally met. She refused to come along. I've been here now for a year and travel to see her every fortnight. Did the relationship improve while we were in the same city...not one bit. The fights the violence the abuses just never stopped. Everything was as it was. I personally came around a little because she said she needed love, more of it and I did give it. Maybe not in the language she wanted it but in the way and form that I knew best. But any argument we had would erupt into a shit storm of violence and abuses. By now anyone reading this sees the trend. Anyway...moving apart and staying in different cities seemed to have helped because in the last year the arguments the fights, or should I say dirty fights have seen an all time low. But yesterday we were having a debate and it got heated...she started yelling in public...and the topic was a taboo topic on religion and I was afraid her hateful remarks would find someone of that faith and it really annoyed the hell out of me. I repeatedly asked her to not say that so loud and that there were people around us...but to no avail. So in my anger I called her a third rate woman...and in response she spat in my face. That was my tipping point...I should have slapped her hard across the face for doing that but I didn't and went back home and left the house. I returned a few hours later (I don't drink or smoke pot or use any other narcotics) and she pretended like everything was okay. I wanted my space and didn't want to talk but she wouldn't let go...and then when I didn't concede to thing being okay she went on a diatribe of abuses and hateful remarks etc. All through this I was being a mute. I did not want to lose my cool or flip out because of the shit she was saying. So she slapped me. That was it...I packed up my bag and flew back and left home to go back to the city I live in. While at the airport I was threatened of the consequences of me leaving the house (I've done that before in my anger) that if I left she would divorce me. And she has now decided to divorce me and that's all she is saying. 

I'm not sure what to do...what is happening here...where am I to go if this actually goes through. Am I a toxic person. She says I have anger issues.

We’re both studying in the same university right now in the US.

For me, I kind of gave my mom an intro two mons ago about how we’re getting really really close. But in my case, my parents are physically and emotionally abusive/manipulative and I know that they will use this information against me and blacklist me with it in a lot of ways if I tell them about my boyfriend. So my plan is to tell them bits by bits and pretend everything is not that serious and that I’m not that attached. 

In my boyfriend’s case, his family is very loving and caring (I believe they’re pretty open minded too from the details my boyfriend have told me. Plus some of his cousins are dating too and they’re parents seems to be completely okay with it). 

But after his aunt (who’s taking care of him at the moment in US) told him that “relationship in school will never work”, he became very concerned about what his father might say and just decided not to tell them at all right now. My boyfriend trusts his parents and he knows that if his parents says to cut ties completely, he’ll do it because he’s family oriented, that’s why he keeps stalling. It makes sense not to tell them, but at the same time, I don’t want anything to snow ball and explode at the end. The cons and pros are 50/50 so I really don’t know what to do. 

I know that sooner or later we both have to tell our parents at some point so I want to ask in a situation like this when is the best time to let our parents know? 

I’ve talked to one or two redditors and they both suggested that for my boyfriend, he should tell his parents about it when we’re graduated or when the studies are done.

I keep going back to, only to realise how bad it is.",2.0,gnyh9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gnyh9h/emotionally_abusive_relationship_i_keep_going/,0.0,1590102243.0,"Me (27M) and my gf (I guess now my ex) (21F) have been together for more than 18 months now. We both met on Instagram and realised we both liked each other and loved speaking to each other and then for the first few days of our friendship spoke on call for days at length. I met her and her friends, and soon enough started hanging out daily. Getting drunk, partying, and what not. That was all good.

She had just came out of an emotionally and physically abusive relationship with a guy, well just say the kinda person you don't want around you. Which was surprising given she belonged to such great family, great parents and siblings. The guy was a street side Romeo who cheated on her countless times. She has similar friends who all belong is such failing relationships full of abuse and cheating.

I had just got out of a 5 year long relationship with a long term friend of mine because of the pressure of getting married (from her family) the marrying part wasn't the problem but the check list was, of how much I should be earning, how big my own house should be, and how expensive the wedding should be. it all felt too material all of this while she looked down passively on what I did and where I belonged from (we both belonged to different caste, India, so you can understand how important this is here) and built up a lot of pressure on me and I had to get out of it.

Anyways back to the current scenario. So my gf started of this relationship being emotionally unavailable and wouldn't tell anyone about us, which felt weird because she would entertain a lot of. guys. Speaking to them is not a problem but letting them flirt and ask her out and never actually mentioning me was kinda the issue, but that was still fine. we got around that, then we slept together for the first time, and things just changed for us. she was way too emotionally committed in the relationship which made me feel so good, and we got a lot closer after that. Slowly she started being paranoid about the people in my life, so she demanded for my social media passwords so that she felt secure, which she used to get rid of all the female population from them. Some of them were very old friends of mine who all knew about her. When we had fights she would start reacting in a very bad manner, speak in a very dissrespective tone was a first for me, I had 3 relationships before this, none involved me abusing my gf. This was something I felt she picked up from the guy she dated and her friends, who all spoke and fought like that.

After the first few times, I started losing my cool and started abusing every time she would act all crazy and treat me bad, which had never happened before in all my past relationships.

Anyways, so she made sure I had no new or old female friends that I spoke to. she demanded all of my time, wanted to constantly be on call, even while she was showering or working or speaking to her family. The first few months I let this go, but it made me really uncomfortable later on. She had a problem with me speaking to others while the call was on, even if they were my cousins (Indian Joint Family). She had a problem with my job as I had to go out for meetings with my female boss. She even had a problem with a guy boss I have. She would randomly just call me a cheat for no reason what so ever. When I told her this has nothing to do with me and because of your past trauma she would get mad and say ki no because I am a cheater, then she would tell me how good her sisters guy is and all ( her sister doesn't act all crazy with him first of all). She never accepts her fault and feels that I treat her bad, and that I am not putting enough efforts. I have distanced myself from all my friends, I have started locking my room so my cousins are not around when I am on call with her, I have zero female friends which is not that big a deal but shouldn't be a requirement. Btw, she still has her old male friends around, whom she speaks to regularly.

Recently I told her that lets not be on call 24/7, I am not much of a call person (I said this because she would fight when I would be on call with her, which is not always possible), and this apparently hurt her, and she since then started acting like all crazy, one word replies and lack of interest. All of this has pushed me to the edge.

I don't wanna just blame her for everything, what has happened now is that every time she provokes me or speaks to me disrespectfully I lose my mind and I abuse her, and I say hurtful things in return, I obviously end up over doing it. And then I am the one apologising only for her to act more pricey. We had such a fight recently and I told her its not worth it, that I am sorry for what I said but I don't wanna fix this relationship again.

Worst of all, her parents (mom) doesn't see the wrong In her. When told that her daughter is way too insecure and keeps doubting me all the time, she said its normal for this to happen, that my gf's father used to doubt her mom too.

I know this is a long long post, but I have so much frustration within me, and I am so angry all the time recently, my productivity has gone to the dogs, my family life, friends, emotional life all has gotten ruined. Its like I had to do everything thinking twice about the consequences.

Most importantly she made me give up non vegetarian food because it was against her beliefs.

We have been dating for 7 years and have been friends for 9.

She has been in United States for 3 years and I am india, we have been managing to meet only for 3-4 weeks a year... We facetime and talk to each other during the mornings and nights and do try to be in touch as much as possible. 

About my girlfriend.. she lives in US and doesn't have a social group just one or two friends in the city she lives and bunch of friends in different parts from her grad school. Back in 2018-2019 she suffered from severe depression, back tracking it; the origin of it was loneliness clubbed with this immense phobia of doctors. 
She all in her life has had fear of doctors which came from a traumatic childhood experience with a doctor and pain management. On top of it she is a single child with a father who is bipolar himself. He and his wife had a sour relationship all their life and had been verbally abusive and inconsiderate to her daughter as well.


This incessant fear has been magnified as she aged and lived alone.Meeting psychiatrist and dentist just made her realise that the fear is mammoth. In last few months she has been better with her depression, has been off her medicines as well but this doctors fear has come on the surface. 

In last few months we started talking about the future. I have a plan to be in United States this fall for grad school and we made plans to be together in the weekends and eventually she would move once I find a job after 1.5 years of school. We both have been really upbeat that we would graduate from major long-distance to a smaller one. In all this discussion I talked about kids and family that maybe like in 4-5 years we can have kids and get married maybe in like 2 years.  In all the 7 years of dating and 9 years of our friendship I know that she wants to have kids but yes she is super scared of doctors and pain etc. 

In last few of our discussions she has said that maybe surrogacy or adoption could be a possibility which to be honest I shunned since I can't imagine that yet, not atleast without trying personally, not atleast we had year of therapy for her doctors phobia and all that fails. 

After this recent conversation about family and kids, clubbed with whole COVID 19 isolation and both of us mentally exhausted( isolation, worry that might not come to US at the first place and complete lockdown) she told me she can't be with me as she knows that she can't overcome her fear. I told her that we don't need to think now and take it short term and then we can try therapy and take it slow and then see.. 

But she has been adamant that she will not have kids, maybe she doesn't want them at all( which I believe is lie) and I should not be with someone who might die because she can't call the doctor. 


So this is the situation. I can't reach out to her, I don't know how to approach her. The whole conversation from fear of doctors has come to you want kids and I don't want them. 

I have tried to say that I love her not the future that might or might now be there and trying to text her and call her but I am not able to connect. 

I also in back of my mind have this confusion that how will I work this out. She is not optimistic, I don't know if she will do therapy and all this is almost next to impossible to deal over phone. 


TL;DR - How to deal with girlfriend who been disconnected with me, has depression and immense doctors phobia and I can't approach her since she is in US and me in India.

I am not sure if I am a toxic person or if I'm just caught up in a toxic relationship that brings out the worst in me. I have been with my wife for all of seven years. We lived in for 4 years and are now married for three. From the very beginning, when we started dating, I noticed how she would get abusive and would make the most hurtful remarks about my ethinicity, family, where I was raised etc. This obviously would lead to me losing my top and giving it back to her with the same vengence and ferocity as was bestowed upon me. I know full well that what I did was wrong. However, what I soon realised was that she would take my reaction and turn it around on me and tell me I have anger issues that I need help and that this was all my fault. At first this only aggravated me further because...although I was willing to take responsibility for my actions, she continued to behave as if my actions were not justified. I am no Mahatama Gandhi to turn a cheek and let the person slap you on the other side, and that may be my fault. During these years of living in together we she has always been the one to start hurling caustic and personal remarks on me, my family and everything else in between. I am okay with using abuses because that's just how we speak when we are angry but the creativity and information that is used to say the sickest most disturbing things to a person is where I draw the line. And that line doesn't seem to exist with her. I always had my doubts about marrying her but then...we lived in together for 3 years and I eventually felt like I wouldn't find anyone better...that I have invested so much time and effort in this relationship that it would be best to go ahead with things and maybe the relationship would see a change after we married. It's not like I didn't love her. I was just scared that it would end up in a divorce with the way things were and decided to not tie the knot as quickly as I had earlier expected. The time we were living in was not just one with verbal abuse but physical abuse as well. She would raise her hand on me and throw shit at me and I would react. I would hit back, although not as hard as she would but I couldn't help it but to fight back. Was I wrong in doing so...I know I was. Was I wrong in fighting back I don't personally think so. Have I had this issue in any of my multiple other relationships? Not once! Physical violence never! Abuses to this extent...never. Am I guilty of my actions...Yes! Did I apologise...Yes! Could I forget...NO! 

Cut to chase and three years being married...I live in a diffrent city and she lives in her hometown. We moved there after getting married because she wanted to be closer to her single father. But I was on the verge of losing my job and got my salary infrequently so I decided to look for a better opportunity and found one in the city that we originally met. She refused to come along. I've been here now for a year and travel to see her every fortnight. Did the relationship improve while we were in the same city...not one bit. The fights the violence the abuses just never stopped. Everything was as it was. I personally came around a little because she said she needed love, more of it and I did give it. Maybe not in the language she wanted it but in the way and form that I knew best. But any argument we had would erupt into a shit storm of violence and abuses. By now anyone reading this sees the trend. Anyway...moving apart and staying in different cities seemed to have helped because in the last year the arguments the fights, or should I say dirty fights have seen an all time low. But yesterday we were having a debate and it got heated...she started yelling in public...and the topic was a taboo topic on religion and I was afraid her hateful remarks would find someone of that faith and it really annoyed the hell out of me. I repeatedly asked her to not say that so loud and that there were people around us...but to no avail. So in my anger I called her a third rate woman...and in response she spat in my face. That was my tipping point...I should have slapped her hard across the face for doing that but I didn't and went back home and left the house. I returned a few hours later (I don't drink or smoke pot or use any other narcotics) and she pretended like everything was okay. I wanted my space and didn't want to talk but she wouldn't let go...and then when I didn't concede to thing being okay she went on a diatribe of abuses and hateful remarks etc. All through this I was being a mute. I did not want to lose my cool or flip out because of the shit she was saying. So she slapped me. That was it...I packed up my bag and flew back and left home to go back to the city I live in. While at the airport I was threatened of the consequences of me leaving the house (I've done that before in my anger) that if I left she would divorce me. And she has now decided to divorce me and that's all she is saying. 

I'm not sure what to do...what is happening here...where am I to go if this actually goes through. Am I a toxic person. She says I have anger issues. I need help from some one anyone who can understand me. I am not saying I am an angel but am I to belive her. I am very depressed. It's a festival for us here in India and well...here I am!

Before I begin there are a few things I feel I should get off my chest.

&#x200B;

Firstly I am NOT happy. I constantly feel like all my problems are being suppressed by my loneliness. By that I mean I can't talk to anyone as I have literally no-one aside from my Mother. No brothers, sisters or best friends. I never have anyone to talk too about my feelings.

My Dad left at an early age. He was very abusive. When I was around 11 another man was introduced into our lives. He was good for about a year until he went both physically and verbally abusive. I have family that live a few hours away but they all fell out 

with my mother. Aunties, uncles, cousins and grandparents.

We moved to my current location (Cumbria) when I hit 12. This meant me moving away from all my current friends that I lived near and went to school with. This is when shit really hit the fan. I'm not an awkward person and found it very easy to fit into my new school. I made loads of new friends but none of them felt like friends. They were just friends at school. We never met outside of school and I never really had one friend that I could turn too with my problems. We just all hung out together because that's all we could do.

Since I was about 9 I had a burning passion about moving too America or Canada. We've visited before  and I know that it's 100% a place I would love to spend the rest of my life living in.

Obviously asking my mum to just move countries is ridiculous. Especially with corona virus going on. But I know that I live in a VERY bad environment. There are times where I have turned to drugs and self harm. If I don't change how I live I will do something stupid. I've not shared that information with anyone ever, not even my mum. Thoughts of suicide are always lurking and edging me on. Now I must say I am a pretty normal guy. I like gaming, I have two motorbikes (motocross and a super sports bike) I play the guitar and I also skate. But my life seems to be overwhelming. I have all these problems and I can't let them out by talking to people because no one will take me seriously.

&#x200B;

I have a plan on how to go:

&#x200B;

Firstly, I would sell my gaming PC and my two motorbikes. This would get me at least £3500. If I sold my other belongings as well I could be looking at up to £4000. It sounds bad but my mum wouldn't mind if I took a couple of hundred as long as she knew I was safe. I will always pay her back and she knows that. So let's say I have around 4000 GBP which is around 4800 dollars. This can pay for my plane ticket. I will go there as a tourist and drive a few states away then stay as an immigrant.

&#x200B;

I was also thinking of vlogging the whole experience. I have done vlogs before when I went travelling to India. I think it would be interesting to watch it all back and hopefully post it all. Perhaps that could be a dope series, however, that's just a thought. Back to the main point:

&#x200B;

If I find a cash in hand job I can find a flat to live in where I can rent. 4800 dollars is plenty to keep me going whilst I find a job and will leave me some left over. Now that I'm in the USA/Canada I can work on getting a citizenship. Of course there are many ways to do this but one of the easier ways to do it is by marrying somebody. There are other ways but that will be something to figure out closer to the time. After this point I find a good old job and live out my life in a country of my dreams. When I turn around 20 my mother will definitely move to my location. She has always wanted to move to Canada but she doesn't want to risk losing everything in the process. She has a good job and a house etc.

&#x200B;

She has all these problems, I'm just 17. I don't want to live like that.

What do I have to lose? I'm thinking of just sending it but I'd like some opinions first.

Thanks,

I'm a 19 year assigned female at birth person from India. This should explain my situation a bit, that I'm a queer.  

It all started when  it was clear my dad took too many debts. We had to sell our house at marginal rate to pay off the debtor, I was 9ish back then. My mom started working more and my dad became drunker and drunker, lying constantly about his whereabouts. At this point I was solely with my grandma, the only person who cared about my wishes. My parents being Asians were busy trying to force their ""ideal daughter"" bs down my throat and wanted me to be a lawyer like my dad.  Especially when it was clear I was a supposedly ""genius"" Kid.  

Here is the drill: I used to hate school. I was always bullied for one reason or the other, especially by the teachers because I asked to many questions. After my grandma's death things escalated and loneliness plunged me into Great Depression. I was 13, and since one year back my neighbor started sexually abusing me each chance he got.  I was so scared that most of the time I would freeze and vomit after he was done.  Since my parents were barely home (my mom worked hard to bring food to the table and pay for school) it became easier for him to target me. 

Knowing the financial constraints, I started looking for jobs. I found some freelancing shitty article writing website where I worked for a year before finding some other job.  I had to juggle school life, my own failing health, my mental health, extra tuition classes and my abusive drunk dad who Kept cheating on my mom (and didn't pay for my hospital bill) and my mind was getting hazy.  

There were days where I feel into panic attack at the thought of going to school . My mom took me to psychologist at the government hospital because I wasn't ""studying"".  She wasn't good but talking helped a little and she assigned me a lot of meds....considering my mom told her I'm lying about family situation

(I still have those meds) 

Fast forward someone who accessed my alt fb account outed my queer status without my consent to a few teachers.  My school was Catholic and it ended up being hell for me. Teachers didn't let me sit with girls. They started giving me lesser marks and other students bullied me into doing their projects knowing very well I was good in those subjects.  I remembered vividly being pushed into an empty class room before two teachers demanded me to strip to see my genitals.

My dad would frankly abuse me but it didn't hurt considering he barely has strength. Worse is that my mother never injected. Which I do, if he ever tries to abuse my mom. I have no support system and my maternal relatives blame me for everything my dad does. Each and every action is compared with my dad's and my mom stays silent 

When I finally dropped out to continue homeschooling, considering I was getting more ill the more I was in school, my mom didn't support my decision and didn't even stand up for me when I talked with my principal about the bullying.  My principal treated me like a wild animal. 

Each and every day since then has been a little better in terms of education. I took way too many course but I also learned a lot, the exams I had taken a had a nominally high score (my SAT was 1400 in my first try). But I kept working harder knowing the financial situation isn't good, still.  

Now coming back, when I was 15 my neighbor finally had enough and thought of penetrating me.  While for the past 2-3 years it was just sexual abuse, it turned into a whole more traumatic experience for me after that. I still cannot stand in the presence of older men and cant stand touching at all.  

Two years ago my mother became good friends with this guy who lived alone after his mom died. He is a nice guy  and who became family..excpect he constantly beats me up and my mom thinks he is being playful. I don't know if being hit so badly that your thighs start to quiver and won't stop shaking for hours is playful. The one time I tried to tell mom to stop it she stopped talking to me instead and preferred to spend time with that dude. Not only that but for years both of them have done nothing but mocked my existentence, tried to egg me on by saying stupid homophobic or sexist stuffs.  I stopped engaging with them which made my mom... spend only 5 minutes a day with me. If I complain that only his has favorites were being cooked (my dad esp did that considering he was very childish) my mom would throw a fit because ""I didn't contribute to the family"". As if I didn't just pay off her emis and electricity bill, and also bought her meds. 

For years I have constantly worked to bring my mom a little relief. I even bought my own phone and didn't let my mom pay for it. I even paid off my father's debt sometimes 

Now my dad isn't a good person. His debtors and clients who's work he hadn't done come and threaten us while he runs off. I got kidnapped once for that. My image in front of few friends is already shattered because of how they saw my dad crawling up-to me and begging me not to open the door. 

One day I tried to defend myself when my dad was beating me after he was drunk by kicking him. Now he is pretty thin. My mom came running after he acted like he was having seizures. My mom called me a monster and pushed me out of the house knowing very well a) i had a fever b) it was well past 12. I got too angry and walked off until a police man bought me back. Turns out my dad was acting like he always does. 

The thing is that my mom tries to integrate her friend as a family but I...cant. 1 cant trust a older man anymore (my parents don't know about the rape esp after my mom concluded I was lying about my abuse) . Due to quarantine, I have been living 24/7 with the 3 of them.  Oh they also broke my room's door so I cant close it if I want to control my emotions. For almost 3 months they keep mocking, piling their frustration and everything on me.  Yesterday night after having enough I told my mom she was hurting me. That I'm not useless.  That I work each and every day to earn money If I every needed to remove my tumor (which appears to be beign,) but my mom instead became passive aggressive and won't talk of acknowledge me.  Today morning after working till 5 am (I had art commission) I couldn't open my eyes due to migraine. I asked for meds repeteadly. Three hours later my mom threw it on the floor and walked away. 

I just.. I can't stay like this anymore.  I applied to study abroad and got into two unis with My essay,even got one full ride and one full tuition. The money I saved up for visa and passport however...disappeared from my mom's bank (since I don't have a card I can't use online payment transfer etc) and parents refused to let me go because of a) the pandemic b) my tumor c) the money my grandpa saved for Me is for my marriage only. 

Now... I don't know what to do. I really still want to be a psychologist but I don't want to stay here either. I can't. I want to complete writing my second book.  I want to live. But being in a society where you're expected to live with your parents is. .. Hard.  Besides everytime I think about leaving my mom's crying face appears before my eyes.

I haven't slept in a while either. Or eaten properly. I just need to start all over. I really need to degree to get anywhere I and I *want* to study psychology. I literally already know about everything they teach in bachelors and masters courses, I just need a proof that I know which is a degree.  We don't have a lot of unis with that subject over here or anyone who could look past my homeschooling status. I really want to know where I should start",2020.0,5.0,18.0,18:36:02,abuse,19

He claims she's too busy to do anything nowadays and picks at whatever she does wrong or forgets in a passive aggressive way. To me she's doing nothing wrong, she's working, keeping the house clean, and feeding everyone. She's also going through pre menopausal depression and he keeps threatening to leave since he can't deal with how emotionally fragile she is. I often wake up to them fighting and then my mom cries. She recently cried on my birthday as well, out of frustration. He refuses to eat what she makes for him. To give you an idea of what he's doing: if she makes food and it goes to waste because he doesn't eat it, she gets taunted that she's wasting food, and if she doesn't make anything for him she doesn't care about him. I can see her being driven crazy and she is truly trying to make things better, and he claims he's tired of trying and will find someone new in 6 months.
He's pretty nice to me and my younger brother but it's hard to ignore the stress he's giving my mother. I'm very attached to her and I'm scared she'll suffer from another stroke, this time more serious. He taunts her a lot, and I have to bite my tongue to stop myself from saying anything, because he takes his anger out on her. My mom spoke to her parents about the problems because she couldn't keep it in and her parents took her side and asked my dad why he's behaving like this etc. Well he didn't like that and told her to stop talking to them. 
So, I know people are gonna tell me to not involve myself in this or that it's not my problem but it is when your mom comes to you with suicidal thoughts. Ik it might be wrong on her part to tell me things but I really REALLY can't blame her. 
I'm scared they're going to divorce. I don't know anyone who's been through a similar process, and I live in metropolitan india so it's kind of a taboo I guess. He has said some horrendous things to her, like that he'd rather she have cancer, at least that's not emotionally draining. 
No one knows why he's behaving this way and he won't explain his behaviour or tell my mom what she's done wrong so she can fix it. He's causing her and me pain as well, my mother is so sweet and she's my best friend. She has raised both of us with so much love and car. She doesn't deserve this I feel.

This girl I’ve never met that I’ve been talking to for about 3 months made a account on reddit and just made complete bullshit up about me. She claimed that I said if we stopped talking I would kill myself (I have SS proving she’s suicidal and completely lying) along with SS of all our conversations. She also is saying I made “alt” accounts to contact her. I only have 2 emails one for my main then this throwaway. I’ve been having serious mental issues with having constant panic attacks and yes I’ve gotten professional help for it. She’s convinced I am lying since a jackass in her comments said I am most likely lying about having it. 


I am pissed out of my mind I trusted this girl and then she makes shit up about me. She also made bullshit claims I was “treating her bad” in which I got mad at her for constantly posting about me and obsessing over me. She literally made then deleted 50 post about me in a 3 day span. 100s of comments as well, she also spun a another lie around saying that I asked her out. (Once again have a SS showing her asking me out after 2 days of talking). 


On top of this she’s got a doctor from India stalking her or some shit apart of me wants to help her another part wants me to tell her go to hell. The doctor is pretty much grooming her and trying to control her. She was stupid and give him her inst and now he knows where she lives. 

I am also convinced she is in a abusive home where her parents are so controlling it’s affecting her health when it comes to socializing with boys. I am no doctor but the reason I say this is because she’s harassed multiple guys on different accounts after blocking them. She’s admitted on her reddit she got beaten for speaking English (yes I have SS of those comments as well). 

She keeps saying that that’s being strict and not abusive. I don’t think I am wrong when if you speak a different language you get beaten. I have her name (cuz of inst) and I am very tempted to call her state police department or maybe even send a tip. There’s something seriously wrong with her since she keeps making up shit about me and then crying coming back to me begging for me to forgive her.

I really could advice. Here is my story.

Born and raised in South India. To be more precise, I'm from Hyderabad, the city. I'm born into a Telugu Family. I'm the only daughter, I have no siblings. I'm 23, I live with my parents. I work for an MNC as a test engineer. 

I've waited all this while to get out of my house. I was about to go to the US, Fall 2020. For my Master's in Computer Science. Unfortunately, due to this coorna virus crisis, I know I'm probably not leaving anytime soon.

My father, although is nice to me at times, I feel that doesn't make up for all the times he treated me badly. He always tears me down. Truth is, Hyderabad is a great place to live in. The living costs are alright, I have friends here, climate is great, in comparison to any other part.on this planet maybe. 

But, life has always been horrible. My dad doesn't treat me like his daughter, like he has no respect for, more like.. he always shows his power and control over me cuz I live under his roof and eat the food je pays for.

 Right from childhood. He told me that I'm not a good person, because I lack discipline.

He beat me several times. The last time he hit me was 2 years ago in 2018 for wanting to go and workout at a gym. He said I should only workout at home and shouldn't get into the habit of working out outside the house, cuz in future my ""in-laws"" may not allow me. And my response to my dad was. "" Why would I wanna marry into such a family who doesn't even give me the minimum freedom, if at all I wanted to workout and.hit the gym.""
I said "" I may or may not wanna go to the gym, but I should have the freedom of going if I wanted to"". So he hit me, and I dropped on the ground, and he still kept slapping me.

 I rarely go out to hang out with my friends. Not because I don't have any friends or that I don't want to.. but my dad keeps calling me every hour and keeps yelling at me for not being.home..and.it just..at one.point I decided that it was just better to stay.home than going out and feeling bad when he would call me. 
Everytime he would call me, instantly I get scared. Like that's not how you should be feeling when it's your dad calling you on the phone right? 
Like.. all this while I have been emotionally abused and I didn't even know that I was being emotionally abused, because I thought every child.is supposed to be scared of his or her parents and that's how it is.

 It's a cycle. It's not like he treats me like crap like all the time. It could be.. one month he is nice to me and then the next 2-3 months mentally tortures.me. He makes me feel guilty for not studying..I already have a job and he still keeps pressuring me into studying. In my spare time I am on Netflix or I'm drawing stuff, he makes me feel bad for using my spare time this way. 

Constant emotional abuse. It's like.. he is bored at times ,so finds ways to make my life a living hell, to make me feel bad and yell at me even though it's absolutely unnecessary. ..in the house  I'm careful of turning off the fans or lights in any room when I exit. Because, a couple of times I forgot to turn them off and he yelled at me a few times, he hit me a few times. So having experienced that, out of fear, I makesure to turn them off.
So one day, my mom forgot to turn off the fan in their bedroom and she had left for work.(I had no idea about this.) It was just me and my dad at home. I was in my room studying. And he comes and starts yelling at me about the running lights and fan in the other room.. I told him that it wasn't me, and that I haven't been to that room , so I didn't see. And his response was.. "" then u should see and turn off"". Like even that is my fault. Like how the hell is it my fault!? Like he knows it's not my fault, right? Yet he wants to blame me.

I know all these things sound so tiny and little. But like.. it's so hard.. he says I have no discipline. I'm 23 and he still forces me to go to bed by 10pm. It's like I'm 23 years.old and still have no freedom. 

A month ago I went out for dinner with a friend and he kept calling me and saying ""are you even a human? I told u not to be out after 6pm""
 Like I can't breathe. I don't have any way out. My only way was to go for MS. I HATE my JOB. I got into testing in hope that I could make a career switch after I do my master's so I stayed at the job. There is literally no growth for me at the company. I have a low income, I can't move out of my house. I mean I'm willing to move out of my house if I could find another job after this lockdown is lifted. But I'm just really breaking down. My heart breaks everyday because of him. I just really hate him.

Our neighbours Don't really like us. We don't interact with them and we are out from morning to evening since we are working people. Since we didn't gel well with our neighbours, we kinda just ignore eachothers existence, So two of our neighbours have ganged up and have kinda made a tag team so they can bitch about my mother, my mom is not a person who takes insults kindly.  So mom and this one neighbour get into verbal fights at times, recently this neighbours mom has dropped by and she is hell bent on getting into a fight with my mom. We don't know why and what is the reason she is getting such animosity towards my mom especially. One fine day my mom is returning from work, She comments on her looks and goes as far as to almost hit her from behind, my mom turns at the right time. She doesn't hit, but it goes into a full on verbal assault, so my mom picks the broom in her hand as the neighbor and her mom are verbally abusing and getting ready to come to her. My mom just holds her broom and tells them you take a step and well see what happens. So this ends there for some days. This neighbours mom is one weird person, she keeps staring at my mom and commenting at her whenever she sees her. After few days, when my mom comes up from stairs she stairs at my mom again, my mom doesn't back down so she stares back, this women goes into a frenzy and starts yelling that my mom is some gangster or what who in the hell she thinks and all, her daughter joins and they both start verbally abusing. My mom calmly shuts the door this time and just let's them ramble, they go on for hours until this neighbours husband calms them down (somewhat). I didn't know about the incident where my mom was almost attacked for few days, my mom kept telling me not to interfere and she'll handle, even in this latter matter she held me back as she was worried that i would do something far worse. Even though i can say that i should have done something like talk to the neighbours husband or just shut these people down, i didn't, I know excuses like i couldn't go and shut them cuz i was worried what i will say or do doesn't help. Was thinking of filing a complaint to police about this almost attack incident, will probably do that because of safety reasons. Another thing to add is the other neighbour just starts bitching with this neighbour and they make my mom as the villain, and there are bunch of kids on the same floor, including neighbours own kids, they are also listening to this bitching conversation, they are exposed to this whole charade of verbal abuses and drama. My mom is good with other people beside these two neighbours. But we just can't make peace with this neighbour. I know this whole issue is not that big but it is still very bothering.

### Tl;dr

In November 2019, creator of the satirical Dowry Calculator website, Tanul Thakur, filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court challenging arbitrary blocking of his website. In its response to the petition, MeitY has cited provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act 1961, which prohibit giving and taking of dowry and ban individuals from publishing advertisements offering dowry, as the justification for blocking the Dowry Calculator website. MeitY has also alleged that it could not provide notice or hearing to the Petitioner prior to blocking his website because they couldn’t find his contact details even though the screenshot of the website attached by MeitY clearly displays his name and Twitter handle.

### Conflating Satire with Abetment and Advertisement

For those of you who may be unaware, Dowry Calculator is a satirical website created by Tanul Thakur in 2011 which generates a fictional dowry amount for every individual based on age, height, skin colour, alma mater etc. The satirical intent of the website is quite evident from its content and design. For instance, when one tries to pick a skin colour, the options include ‘Pitch Black (Not visible on a Moonless night)’ and ‘Wheatish (Almost white. Would need some fair n Lovely).’ The website also states that it is “dedicated to all the match-making aunties of India.” The website was blocked in 2018 after social media outrage by prominent politicians like Jyotiraditya Scindia. Read more about the controversy [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/blocking-of-satirical-dowry-calculator-website-prompts-us-to-take-action-whattheblock-savetheinternet/).

In its reply to Tanul Thakur's petition challenging the blocking of his website, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has failed to engage with the Petitioner’s arguments about his website’s satirical nature. Instead, MeitY has relied on Sections 3 and 4A of the [**Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961**](https://wcd.nic.in/act/dowry-prohibition-act-1961) to justify blocking of the website. Under Section 3, MeitY has accused the Petitioner of abetting the offence of giving and taking of dowry. When faced with arguments about the right to satirise, MeitY has summarily dismissed any possibility of the website using humour to criticize a social evil merely because it does not contain an explicit disclaimer about being satire. 

Another provision invoked by MeitY is Section 4A which prohibits any individual from publishing advertisements offering any money or property as consideration for the marriage of his son or daughter or any other relative. Section 4A is clearly inapplicable in the context of Dowry Calculator which parodies and mocks the patriarchal practice of dowry rather than glorifying it. In any case, Section 4A can be invoked only if an individual offers dowry for the marriage of his/her relative and this key ingredient is missing in the case of Dowry Calculator.

### Error: User Not Found

The constitutional validity of Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 which empowers the Central Government to block websites was upheld by the Supreme Court in [**Shreya Singhal v. Union of India**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/110813550/) because there is a mandatory obligation to provide notice and hearing to an individual prior to blocking his/her website. However, as Tanul Thakur’s case amply demonstrates, these procedural requirements are frequently flouted by the authorities. Lack of notice and hearing was one of the main contentions raised in the writ petition  and you can read more about it [**here.**](https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-the-government-for-blocking-satirical-dowry-calculator-website/)

In its response, MeitY has alleged that it could not provide notice to the Petitioner because there were no contact details available on the website. This is contrary to the screenshots of the website which have been annexed by MeitY which clearly feature the name and Twitter handle of the Petitioner. Moreover, a simple WHOIS search also provides the email ID of the Petitioner. Therefore, it is difficult to believe that all reasonable efforts were made by MeitY officials to provide notice and hearing to the Petitioner.

### Defending Secrecy in Website Blocking

The writ petition challenges the constitutionality of the confidentiality requirement present under Rule 16 of the [**IT Blocking Rules 2009**](https://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Information%20Technology%20%28%20Procedure%20and%20safeguards%20for%20blocking%20for%20access%20of%20information%20by%20public%29%20Rules%2C%202009.pdf) in so far as it applies to owners, creators, developers and curators of blocked content. This was necessary because MeitY had previously invoked Rule 16 to reject the Petitioner’s RTI application seeking a copy of the blocking order and complaint.

MeitY has argued that Rule 16 is necessary to protect the identity of the person who reports any website for hosting illegal content, and disclosure of such information would violate the fundamental right to privacy and jeopardize the safety of whistleblowers. While personally identifiable information of whistleblowers deserves protection, this does not explain why complaints received from Nodal Officers of Government Ministries and Departments, recommendations of the Committee for Examination of Requests and orders issued by the Designated Authority cannot be disclosed. If these documents contain any personally identifiable details of a private individual, those details may be redacted but a copy of these documents must be shared with the person whose website has been blocked.

The next date of hearing in the case is 21 May 2020 and the Petitioner will file his rejoinder before then. IFF has been providing litigation and RTI assistance in this case since 2019 and we are grateful to Advocates Siddharth Agarwal, Vrinda Bhandari and Abhinav Sekhri for representing the Petitioner before the Delhi High Court.

So far, so good.

Now the bad part.

Casteist and elitist. enough said.

Been bride hunting for a while. strict criteria. To him it's more of a transaction/deal with possible benefits( at least our family does not believe in dowry ). 

Should not  brought up in foreign - too ""open"", too ""fast, ""bad habits"",past boyfriends etc. Should be of comparable caste and sanskari. I should mention he smokes, uses marijuana, has had girlfriends in the past ( which I'm fine with, but can't stand the hypocrisy) .

He has poor personal hygiene and grooming habits. 

To boot has that annoying desi attitude of perpetual cynicism, sarcasm and mistaking being an asshole as being frank( ""I'm not diplomatic"") towards each and everything.  I love him to death, but he is frustrating to be around for an extended time.  He has the attitude of a know-it-all  60 year old khadoos uncle.

Thinks he's God's gift to women and any girl will be lucky to be married to him.

I've dropped hints to my parents about these things and straight up told them that any match for him is going to be fraught with difficulties and I really feel for whichever poor woman will be at the receiving end. Of course I'm the villain for pointing this out and even suggesting that ma ka laadla is anything but perfect. 

long story short, he finally found a match ( some what of a compromise as per him ). Done after the usual vetting( parents, relatives, match-makers) . Hasn't met the girl physically. The girl and them family also agreed !

Actually it look a lot of convincing from my side to agree her and my parents to file for a divorce. We filed for a divorce in August, 2018.

We have filed cases against the husband for dowry (which he took), 498a (there was a lot of domestic violence due to less dowry, etc), etc. But in the past two years, the husband has never appeared in the court. He keeps sending his lawyer who keeps on giving false and silly excuses like ""mom's sick"" or that he's too busy with the heavy workload (he works for the government).

It's almost been two years now, and just before this Corona mess, the court had issued a warrant. But now due to the lockdown, he has again got some time and we don't know how long it will take.

The divorce is taking a toll on us now. My mom's worrying constantly, keeps crying. My sister thankfully got a government job post filing the divorce, and she does not have a baby. I keep telling them that life's much bigger than these superficial relationships, and finding a new husband wouldn't be tough. But to no avail. Typical middle-class parents.

I need advice on how to take things forward. If you know of some really good divorce lawyer who will not be too heavy on our pocket-books, please PM (in and around Ghaziabad). I also want to do mental counselling for both my sister and my mother. I need help here guys, please. I am devastated with what's becoming of my family. Thankfully, there are no financial hardships right now. But the mental anguish is on some other level. I would rather have financial hardships than this. We had a wonderful family but everything seems to be falling apart now. On top of this is my sister's extremely rude/entitled behaviour towards us. But I can only imagine the mental trauma she has undergone.

I have a question. What would it take for this case to get transferred to Delhi? Shall I approach the National Commission for Women? How good is it? Shall I go to the newspapers to get a story published and name-and-shame him?",2020.0,5.0,1.0,09:41:06,dowry,

As we stare down a lockdown in most Indian cities access to the internet has never been more important than it is right now. This not only means the ability to connect but also the political freedom ensured towards such access. Here, 5 years ago a division bench of the Supreme Court composed of Justices Chalameshwar and Nariman laid down an important foundation for internet freedom that is today under threat.   


This victory was made possible due to the work and close collaboration of multiple litigants, lawyers and digital rights organisations ([**link**](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/VDznbaFeNxSGnLfrYwOBcM/Behind-the-scenes-of-the-fight-against-Section-66A.html)). We mark this day to credit not only this victory but also to indicate urgency why this victory may not hold without a well resourced defence of its core principles.   


***The Shreya Singhal judgement as a significant step for Internet Freedom***  


This was through the [**Shreya Singhal Verdict**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/110813550/) that struck down Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 which was used to send political dissenters to jail across the political spectrum ([**link to summary**](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/shreya-singhal-v-union-of-india/)). But much beyond it, the judgement also provided relief and greater clarity on the issue of takedowns by online service providers like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram etc. These platforms which are intermediary provide services that are utilised by millions today for exchanging information and bringing comfort to each other. However, they are also abused by content that is false and misleading or to make violent threats or hate speech.   


Striking a fine balance the Supreme Court held that such platforms as per the provisions under the law cannot be made liable for the acts of the users who post such illegal content. Given the volume of content they cannot be legally required to pre-filter, screen or exercise editorial control. Here, legal liability on them arises only when they fail to act for a specific takedown notice that states that such content is illegal and is sent under a valid court order or an executive authority. This check and balance ensures that there will be an opportunity for natural justice and it will prevent what many lawyers explain as a “chilling effect”.  The third element of the Shreya Singhal judgement was on website blocking where disappointingly the court did not extensively engage with the arguments made by the petitioners ([**read more here**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/but-what-about-section-69a/)).   


**Continued threats to Internet Freedom**  


As many people shift to work from home, they wonder in the middle of a pandemic about safety, core provisions and financial stability. Many harmful impacts are being mitigated by the close to 600 million internet connections that are active in India that are helping bridge gaps of information and services. At the same time, even prior to Covid-19 the Shreya Singhal judgement and by it’s very basis has been eroded by regular attacks which have been documented and defended by us.   


For instance our work has demonstrated that despite Section 66A being termed as unconstitutional it has continued to be applied ([**link**](https://internetfreedom.in/66a-zombie/)) and there even have been serious proposals to reintroduce it ([**link**](https://internetfreedom.in/government-committee-wants-to-bring-back-section-66a/)). Takedowns by online intermediaries have become worse over time and there are proposed changes which would require increasing surveillance and censorship powers of the governments ([**link**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-urge-meity-to-press-reboot-on-the-intermediary-rules-saveourprivacy-righttomeme/)). At the same time online safety and disinformation are credible challenges. Website blocking orders continue to be made with little transparency and the ability to legally contest them ([**link**](https://internetfreedom.in/blocking-of-satirical-dowry-calculator-website-prompts-us-to-take-action-whattheblock-savetheinternet/)).   


We do not expect these challenges to be rolled back. Here it becomes necessary for our continued work to be well resourced to ensure you can continue enjoying the internet not only for work and, more importantly - play!   


**Safeguard Internet Freedom today!**  


To mark the 5 year anniversary of the Shreya Singhal verdict, we have been grateful to receive support from LiveLaw, IndianKanoon and Broadband Forum who will host banner links and signal to their users to donate to IFF for a period of two weeks. We have also created a video to explain this decision and will be authoring a set of three op-eds to go in depth into this decision in light of contemporary developments.

What makes this a lot worse is that the praise  continued on into the late 1930s, when it was clear that Nazis were  rounding up and persecuting Jews and other minorities. Unlike Bose,  whose support was out of anti-colonialism, these people admired the  ideology of the fascists. Some quotes from Savarkar validate this:

""There is no reason to suppose that Hitler must be a human monster  because he passes off as a Nazi, Nazism proved undeniably the savior of  Germany.""

""If we Hindus in India grow stronger, in time these Muslim friends of  the League type will have to play the part of German-Jews instead.""

“The very fact that Germany or Italy has so wonderfully recovered and  grown so powerful as never before at the touch of Nazi or Fascist  magical wand is enough to prove that those political ‘isms’ were the  most congenial tonics their health demanded.”

A nation is formed by a majority living therein. What did the Jews do  in Germany? They being in minority were driven out from Germany.”

This is from Golwalkar's book which was published in 1939:

""German race pride has now become the topic of the day. To keep up  the purity of the race and its culture, Germany shocked the world by her  purging the country of the Semitic Races - the Jews ... a good lesson  for us in Hindustan for us to learn and profit by.""

This is the same organisation which rules India by proxy, through  various BJP leaders who were all RSS karyakartas at one point in their  political careers. It is the Constitution and our democracy which  prevents them from taking complete control, but they remain an  existential threat to the idea of India. It is surprising how little  most Indians know about this topic, and when you confront any garden  variety sanghi/fascist with this information, they are quick to  prevaricate and seek nuance, nuance not reserved while attacking and  defaming their political rivals.

I have a lot more to vent on this issue, but I will cut this short.  This is not the lame liberal anti-Modi type argument, it goes way beyond  that, and few people realize its implications. Next time the BJP brings  up Nehru and Indira and your obnoxious friend brings up the Congress'  checkered history, do make it a point to bring this up. If history is  what makes people decide who to vote for or not, then these facts  deserve to be brought up in the public discourse as well.

But among the obvious progressive affinities, there drizzles classic patriarchal tendencies that we otherwise claim to hate. It has surfaced time and again.

<None of the statements are to be taken in generalized context. Women means sufficiently large percentage of women and so on>  


Women have been oppressed throughout the world for centuries. Its only after the industrialization and world wars, their rebellion marked its presence. The west has definitely done better on that front compared to India. A great example is the aftermath of MeToo movements in respective places. That tells us about where India stands when it comes to Women empowerment.

Having set the larger context, lets dive into narrower universe now. Imagine you're a girl born in average Indian household (Mind you, I said ""Average"". You and I are in top 6% of the population in terms of privileges).

* **You grow up in an environment that offers you secondary treatment thereby cutting your privileges. Be it access to resources, freedom of expression. All kinds of privileges are trimmed. At the risk of sounding misogynistic, its unrealistic to expect you to grow into a well rounded person who can make sound judgement most of the times, at least of same level as an average man.** A classic argument to this systematic oppression is 'oh but they don't have to bear the grunt of earning a living'. That's right. But by no means it indicates that women in our nation are lucky enough to live luxuriously doing practically nothing. The unpaid domestic work they indulge in is just ASSUMED to be their duty.

&#x200B;

* **Additionally, the environment demands you to protect yourself. You simply wear an extra layer of consciousness every where all the time.** This is something every man out there has to understand. yes, Its not all men but still its men that women have to protect themselves from. Be lucky you don't have to worry about such unsolicited burdens by virtue of birth. While we're on this topic, it won't be gross digression to note that most of the male survivors were violated by MEN.

&#x200B;

* You hit puberty. You are attracted to men. You have been time and again warned to be superb careful. The premarital sex is already prohibited in your mind. You maintain sneaky relationship with a man with the hope that he will end up with you. He insists for sex. You cave in after long deal of insistence. and then he leaves one fine day.  **You're killed inside because sex is not a body altering act for men but it is for you. The next MAN in your life is likely to find out about the past affair and not let you live peacefully about it.**

Declaring this act as 'rape' is not easy to digest but also not easy to discard. Not all rapes have to be comparable to heinous incidents like Nirbhaya case. A rape is a sexual act when one party does not consent. Do we first of all event accept that its possible for a woman to be raped by someone she had consensual intercourse with other times ?  Be it by woman's husband, boyfriend, sex partner, friend with benefits.  Whenever we hear about such incidents, don't lie to me; the first thought crossing our minds is- '*she's just making this up*'. Because women can be jealous, envious, able to speak truth only when the incident is fresh and all those things except needing time to process and courage to oust the culprit.

The topic at hand also revolves around this subjective, non-tangible entity of consent. The consent for sex is always conditional. The person you slept with would not have done so if we change just a couple of things about your being; your looks, your stature, your caste, your religion etc. A lot of these things are to be taken at face value. You cant lie about something like your skin tone. But you sure as hell can make up lot of other stuff. When you obtain consent on the futuristic basis like promises you don't magically elude the accountability because promises are subject to change.

Its not tangible like cash that you will be forced to return or repay after false promise. To reiterate, sex is body altering act for women and mind altering for everyone. The feeling of violation, exploitation can be extremely painful. Men themselves find their kind engaging in shittier acts like acid attacks and leaking private videos over such feelings. Even the male survivors are psychologically expected to show harmful signs like rage, lack of sexual drive different from their female counterparts. Its childish to expect women to just suck it up and move on.

That compels me to expect honest answers from you guys. What percentage of guys pursue women purely for sex? What percentage of men tell random women on social media that they're in love with them? How many of those messages are actually true ? Aren't men taking advantage of loopholes in technicalities to begin with? Not on technical level, but as ground reality, how many guys you think lie to girls about their marriage plans only for sex ?  How many guys lie about everything under the sun to get laid ? Who's more likely to respond to a message of a random person opposite gender, a married man or a married woman ?

To maintain civility in the society, we somehow have to control men's natural desire to pass on their genes as much as possible without being held back for upbringing of children. That's why alimony laws are there to begin with. Men cannot be unaccountable, uncontrollable entities who get to enjoy constitutional privileges and ruin lives without a scratch.

Let me also highlight most of the trafficking cases in our country are subset of the topic we're currently discussing. Women are conditioned to believe **marriages** are their sole purpose in life. That's precisely why the fake marriage promises are at the grass roots of trafficking. I must have missed the active outrage for women who were victim in these cases. Mind you this is the only promise court holds special. Not the promise of iphone, or jewellery. In fact for a thought experiment, lets think how many men would get to sleep with the women before marriage if they  honestly reveal that they don't plan to marry them?

I personally don't think its justified to impose rape charges on men for breaking marriage promises after sex when marriage was the prime factor for woman's consent and its the changes in circumstances that changed man's decision. But the judicial system should definitely try a man for his original motives in such cases, and the crime should be perceived higher than mere fraud and less than rape (or less severe variant of rape).

Finally, what I have been holding up all this while- the fake allegations. They will always be there. Perfection is a myth. As a society it makes sense to try to maintain balance and level playing field for both parties. While comparing we gotta account the number of actual cases that never saw the light of day and on that your guess is as good as mine.

Let men carry legal documents to save themselves from rape allegations later if the law aims to empower average woman of this country. We can definitely consider scrapping this law in future when both men and women would have level playing field in terms of privileges in an average scenario of the country. It will in fact be need of the time then.

&#x200B;

TLDR: The law is not meant for encouraging women to ruin men's lives but to protect women from exploitative acts by men stemming from disparity of privileges. Life of an average woman in India revolves around marriage. That's why this is the only promise men are held accountable for. We can never have the 'perfect' system, but we can try to bring in a level playing field at the cost of violators' kind just like we are fine with upper caste students losing their seats to lower caste candidates with less score.",2020.0,5.0,26.0,22:25:11,rape,

There is another problem of false rape accusations that nobody seems to wanna talk about.,60.0,fleoe8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fleoe8/although_rape_is_a_serious_problem_in_our_country/,53.0,1584670211.0,"Before I start, I'd like to make it clear that I do believe Rape is a heinous crime and there should be severe punishments for those who commit it. Having said that, shouldn't someone who is innocent also getting the same punishment and being discarded by society be talked about too? what about the woman who made up the story, shouldn't she be punished for ruining someone's life? 

According to the National Crime Records Bureau, a total of 38,947 rape cases were reported in India in 2016. In 10,068 cases – about a quarter – the women claimed it was rape on the false promise of marriage. In Andhra Pradesh state, 45% of all rape cases filed in the past two years fell into the false marriage category. Just think about that, every 1 in 3 is an innocent man, and in Andra Pradesh, that's 1 in 2 where for every 2 rape accusations an innocent man's life is ruined.

It's sad because Rape is a very sensitive subject which people avoid talking about and these problems are still happening every day. I'm tired of hearing every other country saying that our country is the rape capital of the world and no one if only a few dares to talk about false accusations. 

I referenced an article in this post for stats and here is the link:  [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/11/spare-innocent-men-anguish-india-ruling-aims-to-end-false-claims](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/11/spare-innocent-men-anguish-india-ruling-aims-to-end-false-claims)

As some may have seen the posts of few randian user expressing their surprise to the stuff that came out of their parent’s mouth regarding violence on muslims. 

Now ask yourself this. How strong do you believe the moral fabric of a country is, which chooses to turn a blind eye to the subjugation of a community based simply on their religion ? How much hard will it be to jump from hating because of religion to hating because of gender. Now, I understand this is comparing apples and oranges because no community will outright become scornful towards an entire gender. The point I’m trying to make is those who believe they are the superior authority because of “religion” won’t like someone challenging their authority and will find ways to prove their power over another. These same people will loathe women making a fuss about harassment, or women fighting for their empowerment. This is discounting the fact that these “camps” that are being built will only result in cases of absolute horror many of which will never come to light. 

Lastly if there are women reading this, most of you will probably not get in a situation where you’ll be a victim of rape. However I know you know that fleeting dread that comes over you when you feel like you’re not safe. For you it’s fleeting but for many that dread only is the start of something much more heinous. 

PS: I’m not a good writer, I’ve tried to write as best as I can to express my thoughts. Hopefully this “rant” gets the point across.",2020.0,3.0,11.0,23:23:25,rape,

I am appalled at the apathy and lack of respect towards women in general, especially when that generation is supposedly to be the future of the country. These boys need to face consequences although I am doubtful about how successfully they will catch the most responsible individuals. 

But, even this would be a reactive measure. Will this really stop the possibly countless other children that are involved in such conversations? Maybe to a degree, maybe some will distance themselves out of guilt, shame, fear or realization, but the larger picture is that this will not tackle the problem at its core.

I am a guy brought up in Delhi myself, and I know first hand how boys at that age could behave. But this has become a norm solely due to the fact that the school syllabus lacks sex education. When I was a kid, we brushed by the topic of sex in our biology class, and we would giggle at the very mention of it and I am myself guilty of this. I guess 13 year old me couldn’t get his head around the fact that this is a very serious topic that will be huge part of his adult life and would also define a large part of who he is as a human being. And this is the problem. The prudish nature of the policy makers and the older generations is creating a very toxic atmosphere. I guess most of you can derive your own conclusions from the above but here are my points about why it is necessary to include sex education in the curriculum:

1. Sex education doesn’t just teach you about the physical act of sex.

2. It teaches you about the various methods of protection not just against pregnancies but STDs.

3. It teaches you about consent and that no means no.

4. It is also teaches you how to behave and respect boundaries with other people, but most importantly with the other gender. And this is not just during sex, this directly influences you to respect boundaries during other interactions.

5. It teaches you the sexual problems and, to a degree, social problems the other gender faces.

6. It can also counsel you if you are having problems due to sex, or if you are frustrated due to the lack thereof.

7. And lastly it teaches you that people, regardless of gender, are individuals with their own aspirations and dreams, and that the opposite gender is not just an instrument to gratify your sexual needs.

I thought these off the top of my head while I am lying in bed trying to doze off, so I am sure there might be quite a few more. The embarrassment that people feel while discussing sex needs to go. I know that most of you guys know this already but this is not true for a huge chunk of the population, but why be embarrassed to discuss something that is so natural to most species on the planet. 

The fact is that the younger generation is getting comfortable with sex, but on their own terms, without a lack of direction. And this is the problem. If children are eventually going to learn about such an important topic as sex, why not guide them in the right direction.

So being a prude, denying the access to this, sometimes in the name of culture, and shirking responsibility is a very naive approach and this needs to change earnestly. There really needs to be push for this ASAP, and policy makers need to acknowledge the fact that this is a problem. 

I am not trying to vilify anyone. I know that not everyone agrees with that abhorrent mindset, but we really need to acknowledge the problem of we want to tackle it. If in your family your kid is misbehaving, you as a parent will be responsible for that, and that analogy holds here as well. Also please never try to downplay this with the statement that “boys will be boys”. I hope that in a few years from now, when people use that phrase, they would mean it as a compliment instead.

Edit: 1. I would also like to emphasize again that by sex education I don’t mean a course where they teach you about the physical act of copulation. That already exists in our biology courses. What we need is a well built and well researched subject that tackles most, if not all, direct and indirect topics pertaining to sex, which I have already listed out.",2020.0,5.0,6.0,01:20:10,rape,13

Here, for your entertainment, are some of the craziest tales spun by the opposition's propaganda factory. And the truth.

**What about the viral video where Rahul Gandhi speaks about ‘aloo ki factory’?**

Context is everything. That bit was a fragment of an interaction with distressed farmers in Uttar Pradesh. One farmer suggested a potato chip factory in the region, to which Mr Gandhi responded. The entire interaction is presented here (comment in question at 1.22) Farmers’ concerns and agricultural policy are clearly not as ‘viral’ as a sentence plucked out of context by an opposition more comfortable with jeering than thinking.

[https://vimeo.com/300017070](https://vimeo.com/300017070)

**Wait, another aloo question. Why did he talk of a machine that would turn potatoes into gold (aloo se sona niklega)?**

That is indeed a ludicrous thing to say. Only, Rahul Gandhi didn’t make that claim, he was making fun of the prime minister’s outrageous promises. Again, a fragment of the speech was deviously presented by the BJP’s team, to suggest the very opposite. Here is the full video, for those who care about the truth.

[https://vimeo.com/300018438](https://vimeo.com/300018438)

**Why did he claim that connecting MRI machines would improve healthcare in India?**

In a question about healthcare, one of the the ideas that Mr Gandhi referred to was the internet of things. Connecting devices like MRI machines, CT scanners and other equipment through the cloud and analysing their findings is an important part of diagnosis and care. This data-driven approach is the future of healthcare, and it is already a reality in many parts of the world. So Rahul Gandhi was referring to a global trend that his critics may not yet be aware of.

For those who want to know more, here is a handy article from the [Economist](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/02/01/a-revolution-in-health-care-is-coming)

**What in the world did he mean by escape velocity of Jupiter?**

Rahul Gandhi was speaking about the extra push needed for Dalits to reach the same footing as others. As a socially disadvantaged community, it takes greater effort for them to shake off the downward pull of their environment. Just like it takes greater energy to escape Jupiter’s gravitational field than that of earth.

Escape velocity is also a commonly used term in social research – take this example from [Harvard Research](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/lkatz/files/aer.103.3_fryer_katz_pp_2013_all_0.pdf)

It’s not that hard to understand, even for the BJP.

**Why did he say ‘poverty is a state of mind’?**

Rahul Gandhi had said that apart from material deprivation, poverty is also a state of mind. This is borne out by social science research on the psychological effects and insecurities created by scarcity and precarity.

Media headlines mangled his words to suggest he said poverty is only a state of mind. As usual, the BJP cried hoarse. The Dalit Resource Centre of the Gobind Ballabh Pant Social Science Institute, where Rahul Gandhi made the statement, clarified the facts, and most newspapers carried corrections the next day, but the damage was done. Deliberately. Read: [Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/rahul-spoke-about-poverty-of-thought-clarifies-host/story-ERPthC1QhVxjxuZM0ZWgMM.html), [Indian Express](http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/institute-quotes-rahul-gandhi-as-saying-poverty-is-just-a-state-of-mind/1152249/)

**Why did his “woke up this morning, last night” go viral?**

Because to err is human, and to mock is the BJP. It was a slip of the tongue. Happens to everyone, especially those whose words are constantly watched.

This list is likely to keep growing. Lies will continue being generated, because the only limits are in the BJP’s imagination. Some of these allegations, though, are more serious and unconscionable than others:

**What is the truth about the Sukanya rape case?**

This charge, cooked up by political opponents and peddled on foreign websites, was struck down by the Supreme Court of India for being “without substance and without an iota of evidence” . Not only that, the court heavily fined the petitioners for causing reputational damage to Rahul Gandhi. Half of that penalty was due to Rahul Gandhi, and half to the woman who they claimed had been raped. Read: [NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rape-allegations-defamed-rahul-gandhi-says-supreme-court-cbi-may-explore-foreign-angle-502158), [Mint](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/JXeMExPzO8PeL9k7S7m1FI/Supreme-Court-dismisses-case-against-Rahul-Gandhi.html)

That this malicious lie continues to lurk in a right-wing echo-chamber shows that some people are impervious to the truth and contemptuous of due legal process. They will go to any length to discredit someone they don’t like.

**Was Rahul Gandhi detained in Boston with drugs?**

No. Those sharing these fantasies, without offering even a shred of evidence, are obviously smoking something strong.

We bonded pretty well and became really intense and involved with eachother. she is 26 and we both are from India. We both come from privileged backgrounds.

during the course of our relationship she told me a few things about herself

She told me she has dated a lot and been more than friendly with many guys in the past.

She told me she was raped 2 years ago when she was out partying. She was out with social friends and someone spied her drink. and she woke up in some man's apartment naked after he had taken advantage of her. I really sympathized with her then. y. She told me she did not tell her parents out of fear and dealt with all of it by herself

She told me in spite of this she dated a lot. lot of men who do cocaine and avoiding arrest, partied and got drunk till late with friends, and was also on dating apps and met around 20 boys from those apps. She also hooked up once after the incident. She said she loves to socialise and get to know new people.

but these things confuse me...

1. When she met me for the 5th time in her life when we just started dating (8 months ago). she got drunk at a house party at 4 am beyond her capacity and was in no state to walk. she threw up in the lobby.
2. On my birthday, just after 3 weeks of the first incident, she go drunk again and ended up having to throw up
3. On her own birthday which was a week later to mine she again got drunk (but that is probably excusable?)
4. During another house party she got drunk and started puking all over the road at 5 in the morning
5. On Christmas eve, we were at a club and she took off her panties and was dancing drunk and in her drunken state her skirt was riding up and a guy from the group was gawking at her privates
6. She went for a destination wedding and since I was scared if she can handle herself or be responsible I was worried. She did not answer the phone till 10 am in the morning saying she was partying and that the party just got done while I was up all night panicking as she told me she would call me in a few hours.

I fail to understand how someone who was raped can be so irresponsible towards their own safety. she normalizes her behavior and says we just come from different worlds. I do not know if I can trust her for her own safety. Am I being too narrow minded or thinking too much? Is such a girl wife material? Am i being paranoid by asking her to be safe at all times and to keep me in the loop after a night out",2020.0,4.0,4.0,23:06:01,rape,26

After some fail attempts, I searched for best web designers and developers in India and message each of them asking for their stories and help and basically to become my mentor. 

It’s from there I met this girl (I won’t tell the real name, so let’s just say “Ria”). So, Ria is 10 years older than me and is paralysed. Yes, she can’t walk. 

So yeah, with time we became online best friends and we both used to share each and every part of our lives without worrying about if we’re gonna get judged. She helped me with freelance work. Guide me when I was lost and I mean, I really respect her. I literally am, whoever I am today is because of her. For me, she is like a real sister. 

Around 2 years ago, we started a book blog then and by the end of 2018, it got ranked as the 2nd best book blog of India and things were going super fine. We were earning good and our bond is only going stronger until November 2019. 
 
Wait, first let me tell you, this August 2019, she helped me in getting me a job in Mumbai and that’s for the first time that we met. 

I was focusing on creating the content and as busy with site’s SEO and she used to handle all the authors, money and reviewers. See, I belong to a very small town in North India so I couldn’t catch up with the events she goes to, people she meets and you know. So, with time I started feeling isolated and I did tell her this. Okay, so moving straight to the point.

I came to know that I might never become a father in my life and that broke me from inside. I tried telling her but by this time, we hardly talk about anything other than the blog. So, I let this thing hurt me from inside. I was sort of angry with her because she used to tell everyone that she’s my best friend but she couldn’t even read my face. After some days, I got a message from her that I’m not serious and I should be and I threw all the hate I’ve been carrying on her. I honestly tell her my feelings though in a very rude manner. She neither texted nor called for a week and then, I realized my mistake and said sorry and tried explaining her my feelings. Things became good, for a day. After that, she even stopped texting me about the blog. 

I, for my exams came back home in December. Also, I had just opened a travel company with two friends here and we managed to agree 18 travellers to go with us. We got our advance amounts and we invested it into hotels booking, car bookings etc. But then, CAA protests started happening in Delhi and everyone backed out and started asking for their advance back. It was a huge financial loss. 

Meanwhile, while everyone was disturbed with the riots happening all over the capital, Ria started commenting and posting stories about how is it right and I felt bad for two reasons: 
1. She didn’t even care to ask for my opinion 
2. Because of her my younger brother got bullied as he is studying in Delhi and few of his college students are part of the protests

I tried talking to her but then she started saying that I’m trying to snatch her right of speech away from her and how wrong am I! Then on this New Year, she changed the credentials of all the social media platforms and even removed my name from the articles that I’ve written in the past. That same day, I lost my dog and for a whole goddamn week, I looked for my dog but:(((( 

I went back to Mumbai and tried myself to engross fully into the work but nothing was helping. I started an instagram and twitter account just for the sake of my content portfolio and one of my tweets got viral in a really negative way and the response I got in it really made me depress. At that same time, some girl accused my younger brother that he raped her and.... it might sound nuisance but that was a lot. A lot. There are some other things too which I can’t mention but yeah, I went into real depression and then, thus I went to an NGO which is the best free alternative of therapy and I resigned from my job and came back. 

I have given two years of my life to this book blog and it sucks that I’m not even a part of it. Till last january I was literally  begging her to take me back. Telling her sorry and keep on kicking my own self-respect. She said things which literally made me ask myself once, “Have I even done anything in my life!”. I mean it was the rock bottom. 

A friend helped me to get through it... so, yeah main topic is a few days ago, she texted about how sorry she is and I should understand that if she wouldn’t have changed the passwords, things only would have gone worst. 

I tried understanding her point and a day before yesterday, I wrote a message that she was with me when no one else was so, I can’t hate you and neither do I want to. I just want you to be my friend again like we used to be and she replied, “Even I want that”. I thought she will ask me now to come back and everything’s gonna be normal but two days later, she is busy posting on Instagram and that’s all. 

What should I do? Curse me even if you want tp but please be honest and help me!",2020.0,3.0,8.0,06:17:05,rape,10

Before the lockdown ample middle and upper class Indians had been flown into the country in government curated flights. Many of them were thermal checked, many were quarantined, many were asked to home quarantine. Many of them chose to flout norms of physical distancing and went about their business. For those who were quarantined, many of them shot videos of the conditions in quarantine centers and put them all over the internet which were widely circulated by their brethren all over social media demanding immediate accountability. All this while the numbers continued to rise. 

Cut to 23rd March, a nationwide lockdown was imposed with less than 4 hours' warning. Less than 4 hours' with no certainty from the PM's speech regarding what services will remain functional and what will not. All of you making commentary right now started rallying around the whole city panic buying. Many of you sent money across to your children, parents, friends and relatives immediately to make sure they had the means to hoard stuff for the next 21 days. By the time there was clarity regarding essential services, the police was closing down shops and harassing everyone out on the street looking for basic essentials cluelessly. Many also started rummaging for contacts to get passes to bring your loved ones back home. You made sure you were okay, you made sure your loved ones were okay and then sat down in front of your televisions and phones to impart your expert commentary on what it is that migrant workers should do. 

Imagine being 700kms away from home, being thrown out of your work site by your employer, having your shelter taken away by your landlord (if you even have a separate shelter), with no stocks of food or water, with no ration card, with no cash, with no medication, no means of transportation, with no balance on your phones, and with no certainty. Imagine knowing that your only shot at any sort of certainty being family back at your home. What would you do? Would you wait to hear an expert commentary from a person who has no idea about your situation or would you walk back? Would you wait for expert commentary or would you demand to be taken back to any place where you can eke out a life? And most importantly, would you wait for expert commentary or would you look to ensure that your last bit of dignity is not compromised and eroded? 

Whether the migrants from diifferent clusters be brought back or not is NOT YOUR PLACE TO COMMENT. In a situation of a pandemic, our fundamental rights are not suspended. The right to life with dignity remains as vital and fundamental as ever. Therefore, the migrant workers were brought back. Therefore, they deserve to live in a dignified manner. Therefore, they deserve dignified space, food and other amenities. Dignity is key. It is this lack of dignity that you refused to compromise with when people of your class and caste had been complaining about in the airport quarantines. And rightfully so. You need to recognise your casteism and classism the moment you mete out differential treatment, demanding 'justice' for your class-caste members and 'adjustment' and 'greater good' from migrants. Holding two different standards is heirarchizing, it is discrimination. 

And while we're at it, there is an inherent anxiety that requires irrevocable recognition from the state. Migrants who have been away from their homes for so long are being brought into quarantine centers even when they have reached their own districts. This is undisputably important. But merely facilitating 'counseling' without reassuring them that the social inequalities that give rise to their situations will be taken care of is an incomplete, half hearted attempt at ensuring dignity and security. While they are in quarantine, the state needs to take concrete steps to ensure that their families also have access to basic rights and entitlements, that they also have food to eat, water to drink, a home to live in, access to money, healthcare and the promise of a secure income or opportunity in the future. Your response to the situation cannot be look for a problem inside the mind that actually lies outside.",2020.0,5.0,9.0,01:13:20,justice,23

Yesterday evening as lockdown 4.0 was extended, we recorded a small but significant win. On May 2, based on your support, a letter was sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs by 45 civil society organisations and over 100 individuals clearly calling the Ministry to roll back an order requiring the mandatory use of Aarogya Setu ([**read more here**](https://internetfreedom.in/45-organizations-and-105-prominent-individuals-push-back-against-the-coercion-of-aarogya-setu/)). 

On Sunday evening, as an incremental first step the installation of Aarogya Setu has now been changed to a best effort basis ([**read more here**](https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/aarogya-setu-mha-dilutes-mandatory-imposition-156921)). Endorsement and advocacy efforts by diverse organisations from trade unions to gender justice collectives signed on to this joint letter. They played a significant role in this shift, and the demands under it were widely covered in the press.

This change also comes after the Kerala High Court agreed to hear a plea drafted by IFF lawyers on behalf of Jackson Mathew, Managing Partner of Leetha Industries ([**read more here**](https://internetfreedom.in/kerala-hc-hears-challenges-against-mandatory-imposition-of-aarogya-setu/)). One of the main reliefs in this petition was for making Aarogya Setu purely voluntary. As per legal advice received from a skilled legal team led by Santhosh Mathewand Vrinda Bhandari, further steps will continue to be taken in this case.

But, work remains. Earlier, we noticed that within hours of this case getting activated, a “protocol” was also released that poorly addressed concerns of mass surveillance ([**read more here**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-studied-the-protocol-and-no-this-doesnt-sufficiently-protect-your-privacy/)). Further the actual implementation may result in Aarogya Setu being “voluntary yet mandatory” in practice through other notifications and frameworks as being documented by a tracker created by the Internet Democracy Project ([**click here**](https://internetdemocracy.in/2020/05/aarogya-setu-tracker/)).

Today, let us remember that action matters. These small wins matter. They provide motivation and nourishment for the larger battles ahead. If you like IFF’s work on Aarogya Setu, I urge you to consider asking your friends, family and social networks to continue donating to us. Due to Covid our fundraising efforts have been impacted but we are confident that with your support we can weather this storm.

### Tl;dr

Today, the Kerala High Court heard two petitions challenging mandatory use of the Aarogya Setu app. The app was made mandatory for all public and private sector employees by the Ministry of Home Affairs through guidelines issued to States/Union Territories under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. IFF provided legal assistance for the petition filed by Jackson Mathew, Managing Partner of Leetha Industries which was accompanied by an expert affidavit by Professor Subhashis Banerjee from IIT Delhi. During the hearings, the Kerala High Court directed the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to file a reply and to state on record that data collected by the app will not be misused. The petitions are listed next on 18 May.

### Download Aarogya Setu or Face Jail Time

On 1 May 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued guidelines making use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for all persons in containment zones and all public and private sector employees. In case of the latter, the head of the organization has been made responsible for ensuring 100% coverage of the app among employees. These directions were issued by MHA under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 (DMA) and any violation is liable to be punished under Section 51, DMA (up to 2 years imprisionment) and Section 188, IPC (up to 6 months imprisonment).

Since its launch, the Aarogya Setu app has been mired in controversy about its privacy and security practices, and we have analysed it in our [**working paper**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/) which provides privacy prescriptions for COVID-19 tech interventions. After the Aarogya Setu app was made mandatory for vast sections of society by MHA on 1 May 2020, John Daniel, the General Secretary of Congress Thissur District Committee filed a PIL before the Kerala High Court challenging the constitutionality of these directions. Yesterday, another writ petition was filed by Jackson Mathew, the Managing Partner of Leetha Industries which employs 50 people against Aarogya Setu being made compulsory through the threat of criminal sanction. The petition filed by Jackson Mathew is accompanied by an expert affidavit by Dr. Subhashis Banerjee, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Delhi which highlights utility and privacy concerns with the Aarogya Setu app. IFF retained counsels provided assistance for this petition.

After the petition was filed by Jackson Mathew yesterday morning, the government has released a  [**data access and knowledge sharing protocol**](https://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Aarogya_Setu_data_access_knowledge_Protocol.pdf) for the app. We will shortly be posting an analysis of the protocol and its failure to address concerns about legality, purpose limitation, data minimization, transparency and accountability.

### Contagion of Technosolutionism

Despite serious concerns about the accuracy of COVID-19 surveillance apps, governments across the world have tried to leverage these apps to contain the spread of the virus. As Susan Landau [**notes**](https://www.lawfareblog.com/location-surveillance-counter-covid-19-efficacy-what-matters), when you have a hammer, it is tempting to see nails everywhere but India doesn't even have the level of smartphone and internet penetration required for such apps to even be theoretically effective. In a country where only 25% of the population has access to bluetooth enabled smartphones, the government has made the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for accessing essential services like [**railways**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aarogya-setu-app-mandatory-for-travel-on-15-special-trains-railways/article31563211.ece) and this will have a devastating exclusionary impact. 

In addition to this, bluetooth and GPS signals are not an accurate estimate of whether someone has been in close proximity (6 feet or less) with a COVID-19 infected person. This can lead to a high number of false positives and false negatives which end up causing more harm than good. For instance, bluetooth signals cannot recognize physical barriers such as walls and floors which make virus transmission impossible, and therefore, they may misidentify individuals as COVID-19 positive and send the authorities on a wild goose chase. Similarly, since bluetooth based apps cannot account for surface to person transmission, they will also yield false negatives. 

### ""Privacy by Design"" Not

Despite the government repeatedly claiming that the Aarogya Setu app does not raise any privacy or security concerns, the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of the app tell a very different story. The writ petition filed by Jackson Mathew analyses these issues in great detail but in brief, the Aarogya Setu app violates the following data protection principles:

1. **Legality**  
The Aarogya Setu app which collects sensitive health and location data of millions of Indians has been launched without any governing legislative framework. The Disaster Management Act does not provide legislative basis for deployment of the Aarogya Setu app because it does not include any provisions for collection and processing of personal data. Retired Justice BN Srikrishna who headed the Committee on Data Protection has also [**explained**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aarogya-setu-app-mandate-illegal-justice-b-n-srikrishna-6405535/) that making Aarogya Setu mandatory without an enabling legislation is completely illegal. He also pointed out that the protocol issued by the government cannot substitute legislation by the parliament.
2. **Consent**  
Based on [**MIT Tech Review’s Tracker**](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/07/1000961/launching-mittr-covid-tracing-tracker/), India is the only democratic country which has made use of COVID-19 surveillance apps mandatory. Other countries which have made such apps mandatory are China and Turkey. However, in Turkey, only confirmed COVID-19 patients have to mandatorily download the app.
3. **Purpose Limitation and Data Sharing:**  
Clause 2(a) of the Privacy Policy states personal data collected at the time of registration can be used for *“medical* *and administrative interventions necessary”* in relation to COVID-19. This suggets that data collected by the app can be used for lockdown/quarantine enforcement. This is inconsistent with global best practices. For instance, the European Commission has clearly stated that data collected by COVID-19 surveillance apps should not be used for law enforcement or commercial purposes. 
4. **Data Minimization**  
Aarogya Setu collects location data through GPS and it can be used to track real time movements of individuals. This violates the principle of data minimization because location data is not necessary to determine if a user was in proximity of a COVID-19 positive person and bluetooth signals are sufficient for this purpose. 
5. **Security**  
The Aarogya Setu app anonymizes data by assigning each user a static device identifier. This kind of weak anonymization has been highlighted as a significant privacy concern by Professor Subhashis Banerjee in his expert affidavit. He notes that unlike other apps which issue new tokens to be used as a fresh ID after pre-specified time intervals, Aarogya Setu uses a static device identifier. This combined with the fact that Aarogya Setu collects several other data points including meta data, makes the app vulnerable to an attack where users can identify other users who have been determined by the app -rightly or wrongly - as high risk spreaders.
6. **Transparency**  
Clause 3 of the Terms of Service prohibits reverse engineering of the app which means that security researchers cannot independently study it to perform good faith vulnerability disclosure. The government has also refused to provide any technical specifications of the Aarogya Setu app. In contrast, other countries like Singapore, Israel and Australia have published the source code of their apps and other technical specifications relating to cryptography and bluetooth. 
7. **Accountability**  
Clause 6 of the Terms of Service exempt the government from any liability for a person’s inability to access the app, inaccurate information about COVID-19 status of persons in one’s proximity and any breach of user data. Clause 7 of the Terms of Service further states that the government makes no warranties about the app’s accuracy and that such services are never wholly free from defects, errors and bugs. 

### What happened at today's hearing?

The PIL filed by John Daniel was listed before a Division Bench of Justice Anu Sivaraman and Justice MR Anitha as Item No. 8 and it came up for hearing around 11:30 AM. During the hearing, the counsel for the Petitioner sought interim relief to ensure that no coercive action was taken against anyone for failing to download the app. The counsel for MeitY insisted that Aarogya Setu was the best app in the world and emphasized that a protocol had also been issued to address privacy concerns. The bench was disinclined to intervene at this stage because ""extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures"". However, the bench directed the government to file a statement on record that the data collected by the app will not be misused and listed the matter on 18 May. 

The Writ Petition filed by Jackson Mathew was listed before a Single Judge Bench of Justice Gopinathan as Item 71 and it came up for hearing around 5:15 PM. During the hearing, Justice Gopinathan enquired about the previous proceeding before the Division Bench. Advocate Santhosh Mathew appearing for the Petitioner explained that this petition was not a PIL and highlighted the practical difficulties faced by the petitioner who would have to purchase smartphones for his employees and check whether they were using the Aarogya Setu app or risk criminal prosecution. The counsel appearing for MeitY once again insisted that the Aarogya Setu app is supposed to help the government fight COVID-19 and unless a large part of the population downloads it, the app will not be effective. In response, Advocate Santhosh Mathew emphasized on the aspect of criminal penalities and noted that even the Registrar or Chief Justice could be liable for imprisionment if any of the High Court employees failed to download Aarogya Setu. Justice Gopinathan acknowledged that this was a valid concern and he directed the counsel for MeitY to get instructions and file a statement on these aspects. This petition will be listed next on 18 May along with the petition filed by John Daniel before the Division Bench. 

Advocate Santhosh Mathew and his team comprising of Advocates Anil Sebastian Pulickel, Vijay Paul and Jaisy Elza Joe led this important court intervention. Lawyers, Gautam Bhatia and Abhinav Sekhri, IFF retained counsels, Vrinda Bhandari, Devdutta Mukhopadhyay and Sidharth Deb also provided drafting and research assistance for this petition.

301,15,138,Farmers perspective of the recent event when an elephant ate a pineapple filled with crackers,55.0,gwh4bq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gwh4bq/farmers_perspective_of_the_recent_event_when_an/,7.0,1591304903.0,"I am seeing a lot of city dwellers, rich middle class Indians, white collar job holders, bollywood actors etc talking about the incident in Kerala where an elephant died after consuming a pineapple filled with crackers that was kept as a trap for crop destroying boars. Most of the people who write about the incident go like we humans failed the poor animal, the poor pregnant animal was looking for something sweet etc. Now I would like to ask all these people to see the event from the perspective of the farmers who live near forest areas.

For these farmers these wild animals (whether it be deer, elephants, boars) are giant pests that come to their fields to feed on and destroy the fruits of their hardwork of many months. What are they supposed to do now? Think like urban woke liberals and open up their fields to these animals to feed freely and then go into debt and poverty or try their best to protect their produce? How many of these people who condemn the farmers have lived near a forested area and earned their livelihood as a farmer there? Do all of them keep their beach houses and nice urban apartments open for snakes, wasps, rats and street dogs (I am not asking about their attitude towards the urban poor, domestic workers etc)? 

A lot of the people who condemn the farmers think that wild elephants and boars are similar to their loving and tamed housepets, which is far from reality. The district where the incident happened (Palakkad) has a long history of wild animals causing problems in human settlements and the governments does little to improve the situation. The affected farmers never get loan waivers or any other financial assistance from the governments, the forest department is extremely lax in setting up and maintaining border fences around forests, thus forcing the farmers to take steps like this.

While it is not a nice method, the farmers find such methods effective and in a sense is forced to resort to this kind of actions to protect their life and property. One of the solution to this is by setting up border fences in forest areas, or provide free fencing for farmlands in these areas, but that needs state assistance. If we see it as a larger question of humans invading the natural habitat of animals, then the most feasible solution would be to encourage anti natalism among humans.

PS (edit): I used the word liberal in the post to make a connection between political/social ideologies and socio economic backgrounds of individuals who are using this incident to blame farmers. I am fully aware that the criticism is coming from a diverse range of crowd and many of them cannot be considered as liberals, but some of the critiques are liberals too. I am politically inclined towards the left and consider myself as a liberal in terms of individual freedom freedom of expression and choices etc. As someone else here pointed out that considering liberalism as a monolithic ideology is extremely problematic and my mentioning of liberals in the post doesn't mean that I hate liberalism (or a supporter of suppressing criticism).

Also I wish some of the individuals who keep highlighting this issue will express their anger against the incarceration and denial of justice (and bail)  towards Safoora Zargar.",2020.0,6.0,5.0,02:53:23,justice,

The news outlet cited USAID as the source of this information. Almost immediately, this article was picked up by news agencies in India as well as Russia and Pakistan. Surprisingly though, not a single US news outlet in other western countries picked the article (Using Google search and limiting the time to the month of July 2015 can show this easily). Equally surprising was the fact that no author was credited on the original article.

All this looked surprising suspicious so I decided to view the [data source](https://explorer.usaid.gov/prepared/us_foreign_aid_complete.csv) myself and verify whether this was indeed true.

So, I want your opinions over this.

As we all know that during this global pandemic, our country has seen an extremely poor doctor-population ratio.
 With India likely to shortly begin reeling under a massive doctor shortage, the government is now considering letting fifth-year medical students join India's CoronaVirus fighter brigade.

Everyone knows that NEET is the only entrance exam which allows every student to become a Doctor.
Well, I have enormous knowledge about it and I've seen various articles concerned with this.

So my conclusion is there is one doctor for every 1,445 Indians as per the country's current population estimate of 135 crore, which is lower than the WHO's prescribed norm of one doctor for 1,000 people.

NEET is abolishing the quality of our medical education as it is based on NEET scoring only. The NEET is not a well thought out policy and badly rushed and implemented without any social justice or research base. It's like some advisors proposed NEET without any policy analysis beforehand.

Most of the students are from the rural and poor background they can't get proper education hence, a disadvantage for them and for the country as well.
Since they've studied in the State Board and we all know there is a vast difference between CBSE and State Board.

Southern Indian state, Tamil Nadu has been contradicting NEET from many years due to various justifications related to the quality of NEET.

In 2018, 49 questions were wrongly translated in the Tamil language hence, The Madras High Court order to give 196 marks to every Tamil student but Supreme Court overruled this and also NEET paper was leaked twice so one can't believe in the exam fairness.

I just want to know your opinions over this, what do you think about this if it is good or not? 
Our country should change this or not?

Stay Safe, Take care.

https://preview.redd.it/7f60yfc3dbu41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=295bf3a056f250df993c0705d5545d303816e197

**Tl;dr**

The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has sought to revise its Request for Proposals (RFP) for tender bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) according to an update on its website dated March 23, 2020. IFF has previously called for a three year moratorium on the government use of facial recognition technologies under its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In this instance, we have shared a representation with the NCRB and the Hon’ble Minister of Home Affairs Mr Amit Shah. In it, we highlight legal and constitutional issues with such projects. As a remedy our representation seeks a recall of this RFP and a halt to the tender process itself. It also provides concrete policy recommendations for the Government to consider.   


**Background on AFRS**

The RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), which has an estimated budget of INR 308 crore, to further create a national database of photographs. According to the RFP, this database is purported to be used to swiftly identify criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like:  


1. Passport database under the Ministry of External Affairs,
2. Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) by the National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA),
3. Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) by the NCRB under the MHA ,
4. Women and Child Development Ministry's KhoyaPaya Portal,
5. Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) by the NCRB under the MHA
6. Any other image database available with police/other entities.  


The NCRB first released the RFP calling for bids for the creation of AFRS on 28 June, 2019 (Document Reference: 02/001). Initially, the deadline for submission of bids was on August 16, 2019 (Read our first post on the subject [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/maskon/)).  However, the deadline for submission has been extended six times due to administrative reasons by the NCRB.  According to an [**update**](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/tender/AFRS.pdf) dated March 23, 2020 published on the NCRB’s website, the RFP is now being revised. The current deadline for submission is May 22, 2020.  


As pointed out in our previous [**blogpost**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/) on the matter, use of this technology without having legal safeguards in place could lead to harms such as discrimination and exclusion which will be difficult to undo. Additionally, in the absence of a strong data protection law, use of this technology could easily lead to mass surveillance. A strong data protection law is needed to hold AFRS accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties to ensure that there is proportionality in processing the data collected. Proportionality during processing of personal data means that only that personal data which is adequate and relevant for the purposes of the processing is collected and processed.   


**Steps taken by IFF**  


IFF has sought a [**three year moratorium**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-have-written-to-the-government-seeking-a-3-year-moratorium-on-government-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-in-india-projectpanoptic/) to be imposed upon all government use of facial recognition technology. IFF has also consistently opposed the use of facial recognition by NCRB since the first report on AFRS came to light. IFF has previously sent a [**legal notice**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-ncrb-responds/) to NCRB seeking that they recall the RFP and halt the tender process since the project lacks a legal basis. IFF would like to thank the NCRB for responding to our previous legal notice and also for their decision to revise the RFP. However, we are of the opinion these steps being taken by the NCRB are insufficient and there is a need for further changes and immediate action.

In this representation, therefore IFF recommends that:  


1. NCRB immediately rollbacks its request for proposals and halts its ongoing tender process for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System.
2. The Government of India place a moratorium of three years on the use of facial recognition technology by government authorities in India during which time an informed consultation takes place between the various stakeholders and civil society organizations to understand the ambit of this technology
3. The Government of India immediately passes a strong data protection law to hold government functionaries accountable when they collect people’s personal data whilst deploying such systems.
4. The Government of India should pass a specific law with regard to facial recognition technology to regulate the technology in the country. This law should be developed as a result of the informed consultation process as mentioned above.  


**What’s Next?**

IFF has been mapping the use of facial recognition all over the country as a part of its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In addition to seeking a three year moratorium on the use of this technology, we have been constantly seeking information about these projects all over India and have also been engaging with government authorities whenever the need arises. IFF will be developing and publishing more material as part of our ongoing analysis of this topic under this project in the coming months.

### Tl;dr

Today, the Supreme Court heard substantive arguments regarding the constitutionality and legality of internet restrictions in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 pandemic. These restrictions were imposed through orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 which directed Internet Service Providers to slow down mobile internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G only. These internet slowdown orders were challenged before the Supreme Court by the Foundation for Media Professionals, Private School Association of Jammu & Kashmir and Soayib Qureshi. During today’s hearing, counsels for the petitioners highlighted the impact of the internet slowdown on access to healthcare and education in the region and the Government sought to justify the restrictions by citing national security concerns. After hearing arguments for nearly three hours, the three judge bench has reserved judgement in the matter.  


### Background

On 31 March 2020, the Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) filed a petition before the Supreme Court challenging restriction of mobile internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G only during the COVID-19 pandemic. The continuing internet restrictions in Jammu & Kashmir were also subsequently challenged by the Private School Association for Jammu & Kashmir and Soayib Qureshi. These petitions were listed for hearing before a three judge bench of Ramana J., Gavai J. and Reddy J. which had also heard the previous challenge against the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu & Kashmir on 05 August 2019 at the time of abrogation of Article 370 which provided a special status to the former state. 

Through their pleadings and oral arguments, the petitioners highlighted the impact of the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 lockdown on access to healthcare, education, livelihood and justice. These contentions were supported by personal narratives from doctors, teachers, students, business persons and lawyers in Jammu & Kashmir and a technical comparison of web performance at 2G and  4G speed (Read more [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/supreme-court-directs-govt-to-file-reply-to-petition-seeking-4g-restoration-in-j-k/)).  

The petitioners further submitted that restriction of mobile internet speed to 2G only did not satisfy the proportionality standard endorsed by the Supreme Court in its judgement in [***Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India***](https://internetfreedom.in/scs-judgement-on-kashmir-communication-is-just-the-beginning/) because the State had failed to demonstrate that imposing internet restrictions on an entire population for over 9 months was the suitable, least restrictive and proportionate method of addressing terrorism during a public health crisis. To demonstrate this, the petitioners cited empirical research which suggested that internet shutdowns were counterproductive and could lead to more violence and recommended less restrictive alternatives such as blocking of specific websites. The petitioners also relied on the State’s own data to demonstrate that terrorist activity in the region has continuously decreased since 1990 despite the introduction of smartphones and high speed internet. These factual and legal arguments have been explained in greater detail in the written submissions filed by Foundation for Media Professionals and you can read more [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/198ta44Q0gHvGRjMdj2xSZSuzFUuRhIfA/view?usp=sharing).   


### The Government’s stance

In its counter-affidavit and during oral arguments, the Government repeatedly invoked national security concerns to justify the internet slowdown. It cited the history of cross border terrorism in the region to explain why internet restrictions were necessary to prevent disemmination of fake news by terrorists which could incite the public. However, if this argument about the region’s geo-political history was taken to its logical conclusion, it would mean that internet restrictions in Jammu & Kashmir would be permanent and this was expressly ruled out by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.* Further, misinformation is a pan-India problem but other states have not resorted to blanket internet restrictions and instead relied on post facto take down and prosecution. 

In its counter-affidavit, the Government also made mutually contradictory statements about the internet being slow enough to foil the activities of terrorists but also being fast enough to not hamper the activities of ordinary citizens. For instance, it argued that terrorists would not be able to upload or download heavy data files at 2G speed but that somehow students will be able to continue their education through e-learning apps and videos at 2G speed. The Government also claimed that resources by the Ministry of Health and World Health Organization could be easily accessed at 2G speed despite technical simulations demonstrating that interactive resources like the WHO’s situation tracker do not work at observed 2G speeds at all. 

The Government further argued that it had taken ameliorative measures to ensure people could access COVID-19 related information and continue their education despite lack of effective internet access. For instance, the Government claimed that it had established call centres to address people’s queries and classes were being broadcast on TV and radio for students. However, the Government did not address the petitioners’ arguments about how telemedicine was impossible without video facilities and how short one sided broadcasts cannot substitute a full day of interactive classes for students through video conference.  


### What happened at today’s hearing?

During today’s hearing, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, Senior Advocate for Foundation for Media Professionals began substantive arguments by highlighting how the internet slowdown during the COVID-19 crisis was undermining right to health because doctors could not access latest information or treat patients through telemedicine which requires video facilities. He also emphasized on the impact of internet restrictions on the right to education and the inability of students in Jammu & Kashmir to continue their education using video conferencing tools. In response to a query by the bench about fixed line connections operating at normal speed, he emphasized that a very small number of people have fixed line connections compared to mobile internet and due to the lockdown, it was impossible for people to travel to another place to access a fixed line connection. Finally, he urged the bench to consider that besides making bald assertions, the government had failed to show a rational connection between 4G internet speed and terrorism in the first place, and in fact, the government’s own data suggested that there had been a substantial decline in terrorism since 1990 despite an increase in the number of internet users. 

Mr. Salman Khurshid, Senior Advocate for Private School Association of Jammu & Kashmir focused on the impact of deprivation of 4G internet on the right to education and highlighted the inadequacy of one hour classes being broadcast on TV and radio. He further noted that the government had failed to publish the orders of the Review Committee which was responsible for determining the necessity and proportionality of continuing internet restrictions every seven working days. Mr. Soayib Qureshi appearing for himself echoed similar concerns and suggested that the Government should have used less restrictive alternatives such as blocking specific websites. 

Mr. KK Venugopal, the Attorney General and Mr. Tushar Mehta, the Solicitor General appearing for the Government argued that even during a pandemic, national security concerns should be paramount and the executive branch should be the sole decision maker in such matters. They also submitted that the petitioners’ concerns were unwarranted because many Indians do not have smartphones or access to the internet but there have been no reports of anyone dying on account of lack of internet access. 

After hearing extensive arguments from all parties for nearly 3 hours over video conferencing, the 3 judge bench has reserved its order in the matter. 

### Credits Roll

IFF provided legal assistance to the Foundation for Media Professionals for this petition and we are extremely grateful to the entire legal team led by Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi and comprising of Advocate on Record, Shadan Farasat and Advocates, Vrinda Bhandari, Jahnavi Sindhu, Gautam Bhatia, Apar Gupta and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay. We would also like to express our appreciation towards Ms. Revati Laul who painstakingly collected personal narratives of residents of Jammu & Kashmir, Mr. Prateek Waghre who authored a technical comparison of web performance at 2G and 4G speeds, and Ms. Rohini Lakshane who previously conducted an analysis of usability of whitelisted websites in Jammu & Kashmir with Mr. Waghre.

It links to the original post as well._

Sorry for the long wait between updates, but it was necessary as there have been several developments just today (Sunday, 31st May). Some details have been made irrelevant now, due to other events happening, so I will be skimming over a few things. As you'd have probably guessed by now, _it's a fucking mess_.

So the [Twitter campaign](https://twitter.com/shhh53765868/status/1264572202814525445?s=20) managed to get the attention of TOI journalists, and there was an [article](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mangaluru/manipal-institute-of-technology-students-have-reservations-over-online-exams/articleshow/76048170.cms?utm_campaign=andapp&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=native_share_tray) about it, finally, in the news. Another one published 2 days ago by The News Minute [here](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/manipal-institute-technology-students-raise-concerns-college-go-ahead-online-exams-125537). The TOI article in particular was panned by most students as being very neutral and tone-deaf towards highlighting important concerns as it really did not do justice to what the students felt, insinuating that the screenshots shared by students of their conversations with staff members of MIT were being called fake and so on. I will come to the TOI article later on as there is a very glaring problem in it which I shall bring to light later.

Most likely due to the news report, [MAHE finally issued a statement and posted it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ManipalUni/status/1266270649506357248?s=20) as well (I mention this because had it been a circular issued for the students only, it would've been shared only via our college management software and the Student Council via WhatsApp, not Twitter). This statement also has the same glaring issue as the statement by MIT Director, Dr. D Shrikanth Rao had, in the TOI article. 

After these reports, there was relative calm in the student body as one of the several issues students had with online exams was the general discomfort around live proctoring using webcams and microphones, as well as needing a constant internet connection for taking the exam itself, and it was addressed. A few students were indeed relieved that it's been made clear, that the college has budged, even if by a little bit. As this happened, the time-tables for the mid-semester tests that are to happen from the 8th to the 20th of June rolled in for each department, while some had already sent them out by the time my previous post was shared, as I mentioned there. 

And simultaneously, almost all departments also had to conduct lab examinations, which were given a weightage of 20%, reduced from the normal 40% of the final score and grade. All departments had different sets of rules to conduct them, with computer-science branches asking students to design programs just using their computers and such, and others asking them to write experiments and perform the calculations they have to using a dataset that will be provided to the student during the test. The college had not stipulated an upper limit on the time that has to be alloted by the departments while taking these exams. This caused a problem in some departments as they decided to take much shorter duration tests (as less as one hour), while others gave their students up to 30 hours to submit. The Student Council asked the administration to set a fixed lower limit on the length of these tests to avoid students getting too little time as we need to upload our answer scripts on Microsoft Teams as well, a process that might take the already limited time students have. 

That happened, and almost simulatenously, all departments got messages that their exams will be 2 hours long. The Student Council sent this statement to explain what went down:

>The suggestion from the Student Council to the Academic section was for time to be increased for deparments that were being given less time than 30min/1hour. It was clearly stated that this to be considered as a minimum time of submission and upper limit not to be given to departments. 

>**Our suggestion was completely overlooked which was meant only for such depts as mentioned in the email by the administration and on their discretion they instructed all departments to give 2 hours timing for lab examination.** 

>We have since then spoken with Academic section and they have assured us that with this change, pattern of the paper and the questions will be changed too, where previously, more time was being given for larger questions that required a lot of time solve. The same are being reformated to give smaller questions which can be solved within the stipulated time. 
We have informed them and they have assured us that if a question cannot be completed in the stipulated time by students then the department will try to give considerations. We request you all to understand that the Council's suggestion was to help the students who were being given lesser time on receiving requests from them but our suggestions were completely overlooked and a decision was made on a completely different note by the Academic Section.

>-MIT Student Council

In my personal opinion, they should have done this beforehand, but the attitude of the administration as seen by the Student Council of all people should be observed. ""Completely overlooked"" is something I would've never imagined the Student Council to type out for something the administration did. 

Coming to what happened today now, as this is the worst bit so far. As I mentioned in the previous post, the app the college decided to use is PEXA Lite, from some developers based somehwere in India. This app has still not been demo'd to MIT, but it was demonstrated today to ICAS, another institute closely linked with MIT, and part of MAHE. In short, it was an utter shit-show. I will let the Imgur album speak for itself here: https://imgur.com/a/2ilq3am

The software is being detected by anti-viruses of all kinds, being flagged by Windows SmartScreen itself, [and disabling Power Options of the laptops it's on](https://imgur.com/a/8jYg87x). Some reported Blue Screens of Death, total freezes (the Task Manager isn't able to kill the app). [Videographed proof of the fuckery.](https://twitter.com/SatraZalak/status/1267093943260340230?s=20)

This led to obvious hue and cry from students of ICAS, and MIT as well because if not today, it will be our demonstration day in the coming week. The developers emailed this: https://imgur.com/a/VtbnSFT

How the college thinks that we should buy this nonsense is simply baffling. No idea what made them pay for this pathetic service, that somehow managed to also leak these screenshots from WhatsApp taken likely by their own technicians working on the app. They were found in the downloadable files that came straight from the PEXA devs. These are unredacted, because I can't be bothered protecting the identities of morons who don't bother doing it themselves: https://imgur.com/a/U9IHY17

A very effective summarisation of the whole drama is here as well:

>You may already be aware that recently the students of ICAS were instructed to download the PEXALite software for their exams.

>They have been facing a lot of issues with the software. Some of them are listed below, and many of them have been verified with ICAS students by my classmates.

>**To begin with, it is detected as malware by almost any antivirus**, even Windows Defender. In addition to login problems, **There have been multiple reports of black screens, hangs, and even soft bricks on computers the software is installed on.**

>**As the software essentially takes over the Power options, the user can't even shut down/restart the computer from the power menu, let alone closing the program from Task Manager or equivalent, which is also blocked by the software.** In many some cases, this is also true when there is no test ongoing.

>**The software does not even function when installed on a Virtual Machine on the system**, leaving absolutely no way to safeguard the device from not only potential but also imminent damage. In some cases, the software has even been reported to not run directly on systems as the software detects them as running on a VM even if they actually are not.

>Especially in a scenario where the college has asked to borrow laptops if needed, even if students are able to do that hypothetically, they cannot possibly install such a software that risks security and even basic functioning of the system on anyone else's device (not to mention that they won't willingly sacrifice their own devices either, of course).

>To top off the above mentioned problems, there are no proper replies or support provided to the affected students from their college administration or the PEXA team. Also, in the Terms of Use of the software, they explicitly waive off all liability of damages caused to property and data, as well as by data collection to, and I quote here, ""the fullest extent as permitted by the law"". This is of major concern for people who have personal, professional and even financial data, perhaps even of others, on the devices.
 
>In the event that this same software is to be used for our sessionals and other exams, some students of my class have categorically refused to install this software, at least until all of these issues are addressed completely. For this, they have cited the reasons of widespread skepticism regarding the safety and privacy protection of the software. Also, the damages it could potentially cause to the systems it is installed on and the data within them, and the sheer amount of control it takes over the device even outside of exam durations are cited as additional reasons.

On top of all this, coming to the glaring discrepancy I was talking about before. We were told by the Director that an Internet connection will be required only to log in and submit answer scripts, but now from the ICAS PEXA demo it is being told that the exam will not be proctored online, but all video will be recorded to review by the PEXA team to review for any cases of malpractice. So both the problems they addressed before with that utterly false statement are still here: you're being recorded continously, and you have to have a consistently strong Internet connection to write the exam and not get kicked out of the platform. So the statement given to the media was _simply a lie_. We cannot confirm it before the demo for MIT is conducted, which is a problem on its own as the exams in which we're to use this platform come on the 8th, just a week down the road. The only relief that we got from the college was indeed a simple lie, and it's frankly unbelieveable. 

Moving on from this, there is now another Twitter page set up by the faculty of the college, because even they have been treated unfairly in all this. [They have detailed their own issues here](https://twitter.com/FacultyMahe/status/1267109891983896576?s=20). TL;DR: College gave them no vacations over the lockdown as all staff had to work from home to prepare for online teaching and exams, they were given a ONE-DAY notice for the college to start again, while they were in all likelihood away from Manipal, and it was called valid because public transport opens on the 1st of May. They were also told that their pay will be docked if they do not comply. 

There are more things to add here, but I must stop as I have been typing this for two and a half hours now, compiling evidence and links and so on, while I myself have an exam to take tomorrow. Microsoft Teams though, the only place where they should be taking these exams, in my opinion. 

I'd want to ask everyone in need of further info to go to Instagram pages @manipal.against.end.sems and @manipalupdates.  They have gained massive followings in the past few days and have been key aggregators of information and screenshots and the like in relation to all these events. Can't post their links here, so sorry about that.

**Tl;dr**

While most of the public’s attention remains targeted at the Central Government’s push to drive adoption of the Aarogya Setu app, we must remain vigilant when it comes to state level uses of health data during COVID-19 as well. The controversy surrounding the contract between the Government of Kerala and Sprinklr Inc. is being addressed by the Kerala High Court in the ongoing matter of  *Balu Gopalakrishnan and Ors. v. State of Kerala and Ors.* The main questions raised pertaining to there being no safeguards against the commercial and unauthorized use of the health data of the citizens of Kerala by Sprinklr Inc. While an interim order dated April 24, 2020 provides some relief, it  fails to address certain key issues. IFF has shared a  representation with the Government of Kerala and an Expert Committee formed on the issue. In it, we have pointed out the lacunae in the order and have made specific suggestions on how best to resolve them. Our main recommendation is, in keeping with the ideal of competitive federalism, the Government of Kerala should develop a state level framework to regulate the collection, processing, storage, and security of health and related data during epidemic situations under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897.  


**What was the issue with Sprinklr Inc.?**

The Government of Kerala’s contract with Sprinklr Inc., a US based company, aims to create an online digital software/platform to process and analyse data of patients and those vulnerable/susceptible to COVID-19 in the State of Kerala. The arrangement aims to set up a Data Analytics Platform which integrates data from repositories across the Government, agencies and from the field so as to meet the exigency of a massive influx of data due to the pandemic.   


The [**controversy**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-is-the-sprinklr-row-kerala-govts-covid-19-response-6371205/) arose when allegations were made that the government did not follow due procedures in appointing Sprinklr and thereby risked the transfer of crucial health data of thousands of people to pharmaceutical companies. While this is a valid concern, it also highlights the lack of governance discourse related to fundamental risks to people’s privacy which should have been a principal consideration while determining contours of the arrangement. The Contract between the two parties fails to address these risks.    


More specifically, the accompanying Non-Disclosure Agreement between the parties, states that the purpose of the contract is that, “the parties wish to explore a business opportunity of mutual interest and benefit”. This demonstrates a desire to keep available an opportunity to commercially exploit people’s sensitive personal information like their health data. Any such commercial use however can only be done after a system of legislative and independent institutional oversight is put in place. Such institutional oversight is lacking currently.   


**What did the Kerala High Court do?**

The Kerala High Court to its credit did highlight that maintaining data confidentiality is key when processing the health data of citizens of the State. The Court has issued an interim order dated providing some intervening relief to citizens even as it deliberates on the issue. These are:

* It mandated that a process of anonymisation be followed before sharing this data with Sprinklr Inc.
* The Order directed that such data be shared with Sprinklr Inc. only after informing every citizen from whom the data is collected and obtaining specific consent from them.
* The Order injuncted Sprinklr Inc. from breaching the data confidentiality of the data obtained from the citizens of Kerala and ordered them to not disclose the data to any third party.
* The Order instructed Sprinklr Inc. to transfer back the data once the term of their contract with the Government of Kerala is completed.
* The Court injuncted Sprinklr from advertising or representing or holding over to any third party/person/entity – of whatever nature or composition – that they are in possession or have access to any data regarding COVID-19 patients or persons vulnerable/susceptible to it.  


However, there were some issues that the High Court failed to address, the most important of which is the  auditability of their Order. In our representation, we have highlighted the lacunae in the HC order and in the Contract between the Government of Kerala and Sprinklr Inc.   


**The Situation in the United Kingdom is similar and we can look to how Civil Society Organisations have addressed this there to create a solution**  


On May 18, 2020 civil society organisations, privacy advocates and academic researchers including Article 19, Liberty, openDemocracy and Privacy International wrote a [**joint letter**](https://medium.com/@anoukruhaak/open-letter-b7cb79832064)to the UK Health Secretary’s office. In particular the letter addressed a March 2020 announcement by the UK’s National Health Service to grant private-sector tech firms access to the aggregated health data of millions of UK citizens towards building a datastore collected to specifically respond to the coronavirus.   


In it these disparate stakeholders urged the NHS to suitably clarify to the public, the following aspects, before commencing the development of the datastore:

1. What is the need for such a solution? What problems does such an arrangement aim to solve by building the datastore? What alternatives have been explored?
2. How is the datastore financed? Has the NHS considered the trade-offs? What do these considerations look like?
3. How does this proposal shift the balance of power from the public to the private sector?
4. Who has control over the data in these public private partnerships ? Who is most at risk and how are they protected?
5. What is the exit strategy? For what duration is the data collected and what happens when that period ends?
6. If the exit strategy depends on the pandemic ending, then what criteria are used to determine when the pandemic is indeed over? (i.e. when is the promised destruction of the datastore triggered?)
7. What public facing documentation do you intend to provide describing this datastore and the various data sources?
8. Will further use of the datastore by the Department of Health Care Services, or its partners, outside the scope as currently defined, be communicated with the public?
9. What party do you intend to use for privacy compliance and security auditing of the system  


The situation in the UK is similar to the current situation in Kerala where Sprinklr Inc. has been entrusted with the health data of the citizens of Kerala. In particular, in the current instance data has been shared with a private party, not even located within Kerala, towards building an unknown software/analytics platform, which may even be leveraged for commercial use.   


**Constitutional Federalism is the need of the hour**

In an [**op-ed**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/opinion/city-columns/how-the-lockdown-is-triggering-a-constitutional-crisis/articleshow/75513611.cms), Mr.Raman Jit Singh Chima, who is also the Chair of the IFF Board of Trustees, has pointed out that the ideal of federalism which is enshrined in the Constitution of India is being undermined by Disaster Management Act, 2005 notifications being issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs. “Much of what the Ministry of Home Affairs is issuing in its orders under the Disaster Management Act impacts the powers of states and local bodies, as well as the fundamental rights of citizens.”   


[**“Among the exclusively delineated areas of legislative and executive competence of States is the power and responsibility of public order and police.”**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/towards-cooperative-federalism/article30729075.ece) Additionally the competence to legislate on matters relating to public health including collection and processing of health data is contained in the State List under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. Keeping these factors in mind, we believe that the Government of Kerala should create a state level framework to regulate their collection, processing, storage, and security of health and related data during epidemic situations passed through Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. This may be done by issuing regulations on the same under the state government’s powers under the same act.   


We believe this presents the Government of Kerala with an opportunity to pass a framework which can allow for the responsible use of health data through ICT systems during epidemics/health crises. The framework may be applicable to both government actors and private parties as well. It would allow for adequate legal and institutional safeguards which suitably protect people’s privacy, whilst creating a legal pathway for data-side and tech based interventions as well.  


**Final recommendations by IFF**

Finally, aside from the urgent need for a regulatory framework as indicated above, we urged the Government of Kerala to suitably address our various concerns with its arrangement with Sprinklr Inc. as detailed throughout the representation. In particular we urge them to:

1. Application of the Kerala HC order should be verified by creating transparent systems of audit.
2. The Kerala Government should prescribe a clear date of termination of the Contract with Sprinklr. They should also prescribe clear guidelines which can act as Standard Operating Procedure upon termination of Contract for complete extraction of data from Sprinklr.
3. Adherence to best practices principles for collection and processing of health data which include currently existing frameworks such as the GDPR and the Supreme Court’s decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India.
4. Finally, the Government of Kerala should use the questions asked in the open letter shared with the UK’s NHS vis-a-vis its datastore, as a template to deepen public engagement, understanding and dialogue on the project. Such engagement will help reduce privacy and security concerns and would also help people to share insights and suggest measures which may be taken for course correction on an immediate basis.

Religion, history, literature, art. They’re all priveledges which need to be earned through working on things that actually matter, the quality of life of a civilisation. 

Without happiness, peace and personal security the downtrodden and the neglected will get frustrated, and conflicts will arise which will hamper each and every good initiative taken either by a person, or a family, or a group.

BODY (the actual rant)

The news for viewership attracts fear and hatred and gore and doesn’t simply report it but magnifies it. They don’t spread knowledge or fun facts, they only spread fear. We need information! Not “news”! RW media houses are trained not to speak, but to yell on the cameras, and our whole civilisation watches them every single day. LW is taught to speak more politely but to show only the negatives. With the lack of true security and true justice, the media houses, like many other industries, have had their spines twisted and broken by goons belonging to politically active strata of our country. 

Post 2010-11, the propaganda machinery, earlier used to save a particular “ideology” from extinction in the past, was collectively summoned by the ruling class. And utilised to incite and initiate gullible patriots to create such an atmosphere which would help some insecure criminals to hide the skeletons hidden in their closets. When everyone is a sinner, everyone is a saint. But now that “ideology” has gone out of control.  It is being celebrated by the intellectuals of the RW. Because they can talk about this stuff in their own tea parties. And it gives a purpose in life to the elite of the LW. 

Now the process cannot be stopped because if the wheels stop turning, the machinery collapses. So riled up teenagers or internet warriors many of whom see it as an opportunity to climb the ladder follow, propagate and enhance on the same views, the puppet masters never giving up, because there’s just too much to lose now. The only way for the ex rulers to survive is to lay down, let the ball roll, and for current rulers it is to stick to the script and the image that had initially welcomed them to power. Both are each other’s sworn enemies, both are afraid from being seen naked by their people, both are afraid someone amongst their population, might open up their skeleton filled closets. So their common enemy is the population itself, the law, justice, and the rest.

Their enemies are losing. People have forgotten what LIFE is really all about. What real work actually does to the spirit of a human being. How real education feels like. They’ve forgotten that god is in each one of us. Our flame is dying 

CONCLUSION

The power of propaganda, media and information, is to make or break a civilisation. And if it is ruining the valuable resource that a young and healthy workforce is. If it is being used to weaken its own people, then it’s not by chance but by choice. 

The ruling class is not dumb, it is accountable. 
And it isn’t one person. It’s a class of people. A system. A group of organisations who exchange seats as another one of their games of illusion.",2020.0,6.0,5.0,10:23:50,justice,11

### Tl;dr

IFF has written an open letter to Justice A.P. Shah and shared a copy of it with the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). In it we have expressed our concerns of self censorship beginning to permeate across online video platforms. We have sent this as a response to three recent developments. First, the Government filed a counter affidavit before the Supreme Court last month in which it endorsed self-regulatory institutional mechanisms for domains like social media. Second, the Minister of Information & Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar met with industry players setting a 100 day timeline for market participants to agree on a code of conduct and adjudicatory mechanism. Third, Hotstar India’s largest online curated content providers banned an episode of Last Week Tonight which dedicated an 18 minute segment to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Therefore, we have written to Justice Shah to take cognizance of these developments and the risk the IAMAI’s self regulation code poses to people’s right to receive and impart information.

### Background

In early February 2020, the Internet and Mobile Association of India launched a new Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it sought to establish a second tier oversight mechanism under the aegis of a Digital Content Complaint Council (“DCCC”). The DCCC has been constituted in a manner which is eerily similar to the Broadcast Content Complaints Council (“BCCC”) which is the relevant self-regulatory oversight mechanism for television in India. Notably, the BCCC and the accompanying self-regulation code operates parallel to statutorily recognised content norms for cable television. When such parallel frameworks subsist it is likely that content creation, removal and censorship decisions err on the side of caution. As we all know, India’s TV ecosystem has aligned itself to be a risk averse space where content remains homogeneous and its quality pales in comparison to global creative economies.

We have studied the IAMAI’s self regulation framework and many of the same problems that we see with respect to TV come up in this context as well. It establishes vague prohibited content norms which go beyond constitutional thresholds and provisions under relevant laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. In addition we are concerned with the way that the framework has been designed in an exclusionary manner, the scope and applicability of the DCCC and its interactions with government in particular, and limited actual considerations of the public’s right to free speech and expression.

We believe it is likely to translate into a paradigm where there will be excessive self censorship which will plague India’s online content space. At a broader level we believe it will lead to an overarching chilling effect which will mean that certain types of content will not get made and it will lead to a body blow for plurality and diversity in India’s fledgling online content ecosystem. Sensing these concerns we have already written to the [**IAMAI** ](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/)and the touted chairperson of the proposed DCCC, the former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, [**Justice A.P. Shah**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-gentle-open-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-the-online-video-self-regulatory-code/). In it we have articulated our aforementioned concerns with the framework.

Subsequent developments since then reinforce our trepidation with the DCCC and the IAMAI’s self regulation code. To be sure, the Code has only five signatories who have developed the code in conjunction with the IAMAI in an opaque manner-- with no inputs from external stakeholders. The exclusionary nature of the Code is magnified by the fact that the online curated content space in India has more than 35 payers. Therefore, it is concerning that the Indian Government has started taking steps to formalise industry wide adoption and endorse such parallel frameworks which fuel self censorships.

### Latest Developments

In an ongoing matter on online content regulation, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) filed a counter affidavit filed before the Supreme Court of India. In it MIB [**endorsed**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/self-regulation-model-may-work-for-ott-companies-govt/articleshow/74410087.cms) a self-regulatory institutional mechanism for other domains like social media. This concerns us because it seems like there is a slippery slope brewing which could lead to a chilling effect spreading across major online platforms (both which are fully curated and those which are semi-curated).

Additionally, a [**report**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/curb-your-ott-instincts/articleshow/74449516.cms) in the Mumbai Mirror dated March 03, 2020 revealed that the Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr Prakash Javadekar met with online content industry representatives. In the meeting, the Minister gave the representatives a 100-day timeline by when they must arrive at a consensus on an industry code of conduct and an appropriate adjudicatory mechanism. This is clearly indicative of a risk that the Government may be pushing other segments of the industry to become signatories to the IAMAI Code and come under the jurisdiction of the DCCC. If this happens we could be fast heading to a restrictive online content space along the lines of how it functions in the Indian television ecosystem.

Our concerns self-censorship were of course exacerbated by the recent incident in which Hotstar, one of the primary signatories to the IAMAI’s self regulation code, proactively [**banned**](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-last-week-tonight-episode-criticising-narendra-modi/article30920096.ece) an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver which was centred on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

### What have we written?

Given these multiple developments we have written to Justice A.P. Shah outlining these incidents and how it ties up with our stance on the IAMAI self-regulation code. We have urged the concerned parties to revisit their current positions and will follow up with them to consider avenues through which self-regulation does not become a gateway to trample upon people’s freedom of speech and expression, overall creativity, diversity and plurality. To this end, we have shared with both Justice Shah and the IAMAI Governing Council links to a recent report by [**Access Now**](https://www.accessnow.org/guide-how-to-protect-human-rights-in-content-governance/) which looks at different models of online content governance. The report also examines self-regulation and outlines certain key principles in ensuring such systems do not violate human rights.

IFF will continue to continue to engage with the subject, and fight towards ensuring self-regulation does not become a means for collateral censorship.

310,24,173,Why Delhi violence is a 'pogrom'.. A powerful rebuttal of the 'both sides' argument peddled by liberals. Courtesy of Kavita Krishnan on Twitter.,146.0,ffsgpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffsgpv/why_delhi_violence_is_a_pogrom_a_powerful/,22.0,1583777330.0,"A ‪thread‬ on whether it's wrong to call Delhi violence a pogrom‬. 

I request liberal friends, journalists, citizens, to please read with patience. I'm not looking to label, ridicule, but to clarify. Making this point at Young India Rises‬ March for peace, justice, democracy. 

So, it's a FACT that Muslims and Hindus have been killed in the violence. Every drop of blood shed, every life lost, is equally precious - and it is the Home Minister Amit Shah & Narendra Modi who have that every drop of blood on THEIR hands, on the hands of Delhi Police.

Were you tempted to say there are ""two sides""? Be honest, many feel this way. 

But the thing to note is that only ONE side had the Delhi Police, the State machinery on its side. Only ONE side could hear Court say that ""it's not the right time to file an FIR"".

Only ONE side could have police break CCTV to protect them, have a judge sent packing because he ordered arrest of its ringleaders. So even if you think there are 2 sides, you've to see the 2 sides are NOT EQUAL. 

ONE has the entire state machinery on its side, & enjoys full impunity.

And that's the very definition of a pogrom, of state sponsored targeted genocide -  State backed killing of members of a particular ethnic, religious, or ideological group is a pogrom. To say #DelhiPogrom2020 or #DelhiGenocide2020 isn't to say the Hindu victims don't count!

When we say #MuslimLivesMatter we don't mean Hindu lives matter less. Instead we are pointing out that for the Delhi Police and their bosses, Muslim lives are like ""termites"". The Delhi Police did not kick Hindu victims in the gut asking them to sing the anthem.

It's important not to seek a ""perfect victim"". Muslims are overwhelmingly the victims of  STATE SPONSORED hate and violence, even if some Hindus are also victims of violence (by some Muslims)

So finally: we've to demand accountability from the PM and HM. They're the रहबर ए मुल्क (Leaders of the nation) - Ask them to meet our eyes and tell us, whose blood is this, of every victim, that you have on your hands.

To rephrase this: There are victims on both sides. Every victim's blood is on this Govt. But the perpetrators were not two evenly matched sides. The police, state machinery, even court, Govt all openly or tacitly abetted only the targeted anti Muslim violence.",2020.0,3.0,9.0,23:53:50,justice,
311,25,175,"Dear Indians please read this post about Harsh Mander, a retired civil servant, who is feeding thousands of people a day.",102.0,fuypv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fuypv5/dear_indians_please_read_this_post_about_harsh/,5.0,1586053856.0,"My fellow Indians, Harsh Mander a retired civil servant is feeding thousands of Indians a day, he is stepping up where the government is failing. He and other volunteers with him are risking their lives to feed thousands of poor people. They are stepping up where the government is failing it's citizens, they are risking infection when we are sitting at home as if it's a vacation. 

A few days ago the solicitor general of India put up fake and baseless allegations against Harsh Mander,the allegations were that Mr Maser had made derogatory comments that brought disrepute to the Supreme Court , the chief justice did not even hear to Harsh Mander's Lawyer and scolded Harsh Mander for bringing disrepute to the Supreme Court, they scolded him without even reading his speech and just based on what the solicitor general said. These allegations against Mr Mander was made after he made complaints of hate speeches during the Delhi Riots.

Excerpts from the hearing:
the Chief Justice of India (CJI) said: “If this is what you feel about the Court, then we will have to decide what to do about you.” He also decided to defer a hate speech petition presented by Mander. “Till we sort this out we will not hear you but will hear others.”

Mander’s lawyer, Dushyant Dave, pleaded with the judges: “Please go through the entire speech … the filing of the application by Delhi Police against Mander is an attempt to browbeat him … He is being put in the dock for nothing.” But, again, the Court did not hear the full speech. It continued to rely on the Solicitor General’s version now, presumably, supported by the police. And it ordered Mander to respond to the allegations and fixed an April date for the next hearing.

I request Indians to please write an email to both the solicitor general and the Chief Justice of India. The email should be polite courteous and should have 100% accuracy of facts. Please write in the email that Mr Mander has been doing great service to the nation and such treatment of him is not appreciated by the citizens. Please humbly, politely and respectfult remind both the Solicitor General and the Chief Justice, that the world is an uncertain place and that governments fall and rise in an instant, this government too shall change one day. The government may change but the citizens will remain the same, and the citizens shall remember the conduct of the members of the legal system and that you fear that a lunatic like the one who showed Mr Adnan Goswami his place, may someday also remind the members of the legal system about their good and bad deeds, and that the citizens of India shall remember the good and bad deeds long after this government has changed. Please send them a email together so that they both know that the email was sent to them together. Send it en masse so they won't be able to single out anybody. If you are concerned about your privacy use a VPN and an anonymous email system found online. Please don't let your message be rude, vulgar or violent.

312,26,181,ITS LOCK ON for Indian Real Estate,4.0,fxmvof,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxmvof/its_lock_on_for_indian_real_estate/,14.0,1586440394.0,"  

***LOCK – ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.

· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.

**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

### Tl;dr

On 16.05.2020, Foundation for Media Professionals wrote to the Special Committee established by the Supreme Court to decide the issue of restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir. In its representation, FMP has urged the Special Committee to pay heed to the Supreme Court's holding that internet restrictions are proportionate only if they are geographically and temporally limited. Therefore, blanket orders cannot be issued which indiscriminately slow down internet services in all districts of Jammu & Kashmir without providing specific reasons for each district. In addition to this, the representation reiterated FMP's submissions made before the Supreme Court about unsuitability of internet restrictions as a tool to address terrorism and suggested that there were several less restrictive alternatives available to the government such as blocking specific websites or restricting internet access for a limited period in a limited area to tackle the threat of terrorism.

### Timeline of Events

Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) had filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir on 31.03.2020. The petition highlighted how slowdown of internet services in the region had deprived the people of their right to access healthcare, education, livelihood, justice and information during the COVID-19 pandemic (Read more about the petition [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/sc-issues-notice-in-fmps-petition-seeking-restoration-of-4g-internet-services-in-jammu-kashmir-during-covid-19-crisis/)).

To concretely demonstrate the impact of the restrictions, the Director of FMP- Ms. Revati Laul  collected personal testimonies of doctors, students, teachers, businesspersons, lawyers and journalists in Jammu & Kashmir about the hardships being faced by them due to lack of effective internet. The petitioners also filed an affidavit authored by Mr. Prateek Waghre which provided a technical analysis of web performance at 2G v. 4G speed and revealed that video facilities and important resources like WHO's Situation Tracker did not function at 2G speed. (Read more about these affidavits [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/supreme-court-directs-govt-to-file-reply-to-petition-seeking-4g-restoration-in-j-k/)).

The matter was substantively heard by the Supreme Court on 04.05.2020 and the Court reserved its order in the matter on the same day. During the oral hearing and in its counter-affidavit, the government repeatedly cited the threat of terrorists using the internet to conduct their operations, recruit new members and spread propaganda as a justification for the restrictions on internet speed. However, the petitioners challenged this narrative through empirical studies and the government's own data which showed there was no rational connection between internet access and rise in terrorism (Read more about the court hearing [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/sc-reserves-judgement-in-petitions-for-4g-restoration-in-j-k/)).

On 11.05.2020, the Supreme Court pronounced its verdict in the matter and it constituted a Special Committee consisting of (i) Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, (ii) Secretary, Department of Telelcom and (iii) Chief Secretary, U.T. of Jammu & Kashmir to decide whether the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir was necessary and proportionate after balancing competing concerns of terrorism and human rights. The Committee was also required to consider alternatives suggested by the petitioners including restoration of high speed internet in some districts on a trial basis (Read more about the judgement [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/supreme-courts-j-k-4g-restoration-decision-disappointing-but-we-are-determined/)).

### Special Committee must restore 4G

On 16.05.2020, FMP wrote to all members of the Special Committee seeking restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir. In its representation, FMP laid emphasis on the Supreme Court's observation that previous orders issued by the government under the Telecom Suspension Rules had imposed restrictions across all districts of Jammu & Kashmir without providing any specific reasons for each district. The representation also highlighted the Supreme Court's holding that internet restrictions are proportionate only if they are geographically and temporally limited. Therefore, blanket orders cannot be issued which indiscriminately slow down internet services in all districts of Jammu & Kashmir without providing district specific reasons. 

In addition to this, the recent representation reiterated FMP's submissions made before the Supreme Court about unsuitability of internet restrictions as a tool to address terrorism and pointed out that terrorist activities had increased in Jammu & Kashmir during the two weeks preceeding the most recent order dated 11.05.2020 despite severe internet restrictions being in place. Finally, the representation suggested that there were several less restrictive alternatives available to the government such as blocking specific websites or restricting internet access for a limited period in a limited area to tackle the threat of terrorism.

IFF provided drafting assistance for this representation to the Special Committee. IFF retained counsels have also provided legal representation to FMP in the recent petition regarding internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 pandemic and the previous challenge against the communication shutdown imposed in the region after abrogation of Article 370. Along with FMP, we remain fully committed to restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir and this representation is another incremental step towards achieving this goal which will require public advocacy, legislative reform and follow up litigation in the long term.

What happened in Bangalore on Wednesday:

1. Video surfaces of two youth beating two cops on the road during the lock down, everyone bays for their blood and call to hang them in public for beating cops on duty. Media runs amok saying such people should be made an example of, don't spare them, the usual media mileage.
2. Youth arrested immediately, Police Commissioner says they were performing wheelies on empty roads and attacked cops when stopped. Sent to jail under stringent sections. Rowdy sheets opened against them, which means their future is screwed.
3. Day later, video surfaces on Facebook showing what happened *before* the youth attacked the cops. They are seen been kicked around by the cops, feet stamped with police boots, pockets emptied, all the while they're pleading with the cops to let them go. This video is shot by someone from a balcony. Obviously something triggered them to fight back.
4. No media attention to this video, no explanation from cops. The youth in jail, obviously beaten to a pulp by the cops. Future gone.
5. On Thursday: youth taken to scene of crime for re-creation of events. Apparently they attacked a police woman with stones and had to be shot in the leg!
6. Some folks on FB are trying to bring this to the notice of media and higher authorities to get them some justice.

315,29,189,The Indian Judiciary and the collegium System - How the judiciary attempted to preserve its independence but went too far,21.0,gcojre,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gcojre/the_indian_judiciary_and_the_collegium_system_how/,0.0,1588531441.0,"While we all lament an unchecked legislature and executive , there is something far more dangerous that exists till now - the Unchecked Judiciary & its Collegium System 

To know the story about the collegium system in India one must know that’s it not backed by any constitutional provision but rather by Precedents set by The Supreme Court in a cases : **Supreme Court Advocates-On-Record Association v Union of India** AKA the Second Judges Case . 

To understand you need to know these things : 

1) Under Article 124 , The President has to appoint the judges of  the Supreme Court in consultation with the Chief Justice of India . 

2) Under Article 217 & Article 222 respectively, The President has the power to appoint and transfer the judges of an High Court in consultation with the  Chief Justice of the High Court. 

3) Article 224 , gives the President the power to appoint additional judges for a period of two years in case any High Court is overburdened with cases 

So to begin with how the collegium system came about , we must look at the history preceding the cases . It was a time of political turmoil in the 1970s when the Congress was attempting to impose executive & legislative supremacy and passed constitutional amendments to override Court judgements and prevent any check by the judiciary on the executive’s actions. The Govt also started favouring the appointment of judges who ruled in their favour .

Another tool that the Govt used was to appoint additional judges (even though there would be vacancies for permanent positions) in High Courts and leverage their positions through this tool. This went on even during the emergency when as many as 57 judges were transferred. 

Though the congress govt was thwarted after the emergency it came back in power. 

In 1981 , Law Minister P.Shivshankar issued a circular to the governor of Punjab and the chief ministers of all states (excluding the north eastern states) requesting them to 

1)obtain the consent of additional judges in high courts to be appointed in permanent positions 

And 

2) The consent of judges ,who would be offered judgeship in their high court ,**to be appointed initially in a high court other than their state high court** 

This created an uproar as it was another attempt to bring the judiciary under greater political control. As a result , eight writ petitions were filed and the matter was heard in the case of 
*S.P.Gupta v Union of India* AKA **The First Judges case.**

The Government argued that the petitioners had no locus standi in the case but the Supreme Court retorted by saying that “the cause of Justice can never be thwarted by procedural technicalities” . 

The First Judges case , while acknowledging the concept of judicial independence , preserved that the President should have the last say in the matter of appointment of judges whereas the the Chief Justice would have no veto rights . 

While the First Judges Case did not endow any veto power to the judiciary it did question the Government on its opaque procedures for transfer and appointment of Judges and asked for more transparency on the principle of “Right to Know” and also set the ground for the concept of PIL (that locus standi isn’t necessary for matters of public interest). 

In the Late 1980s , while public opinion was mobilised against the Judgement of the First Judges case , the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record filed a petition in the Supreme Court asking for Vacancies in the Supreme Court and various high court positions to be filled . 

While hearing the petition , the SC acknowledged that the Judgement in the First Judges case needed some reconsideration and directed the matter to a nine-judge bench. 

The Majority decision in this case I.e. the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record v Union of India (AKA The Second Judges Case) ruled that the opinion of the Chief Justice , during the appointment of judges , would prevail in contrast to the First Judges case where the President’s opinion prevailed. 

However to decentralise the power of the Chief Justice , the Supreme Court said that the Chief Justice must also consult two other senior most judges of the Supreme Court and High court. 

**The two judges are now what is called as the collegium of the Supreme Court (or High court as the case may be)** 

And this birthed the collegium system in India . The judgment while advocating for a consultative, integrative and participative procedure , did the opposite and left an unchecked judiciary. 

As a result , while there are mechanism to keep the other two arms of the government in check , there Remains limited recourse to check the judiciary. The judges , even though can be impeached by the parliament , is a cumbersome process as it requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of the parliament. 

The judgment is till today being criticised as endowing too much power upon on the judiciary.  The criticism comes from judges who ruled on the Judges’ cases and even from judges who have been part of or close to the collegium bodies of courts . The collegium is bashed on the grounds of lacking transparency and favouring nepotism. 

Many academics have remarked how the judiciary by its very nature is counter-majoritarian and hence a judiciary that is so opaque poses devastating problems for the functioning of a democracy and the balance of power between the three pillars of a democracy. 

Though the Bill for the creation of National Judicial Appointment Committee was passed in 2015 by both houses , it was struck down by the Supreme Court as being unconstitutional

**Tl;dr**   
Last week a flurry of complaints were filed against news anchor Arnab Goswami for, amongst other things, “inciting communal hatred” under various provisions of the IPC and also included, was a charge under the now defunct  Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act). S. 66A  of the IT act has been struck down, by the Supreme Court, as unconstitutional in 2015. However, despite [**repeated directions**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-directs-states-to-sensitise-cops-about-scrapping-of-section-66a-of-it-act/articleshow/68011762.cms) by the SC, that all pending cases under S. 66A be closed and also that no fresh charges may be registered, the provision continues to be invoked across the country.   


***#IndiaVSSection66A***   
Last week, [**at least 16 complaints were made**](https://www.barandbench.com/news/16-complaints-so-far-in-congress-ruled-states-for-fir-against-arnab-goswami-for-defaming-sonia-gandhi-read-complaints) at various police stations all over India, against news anchor Arnab Goswami. The complaints were filed in respect of comments made on his news show,  on 21st April 2020, for, amongst other things, “inciting communal hatred”. On the basis of these complaints, [**FIRs were filed under multiple provisions** ](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/derogatory-remarks-against-sonia-gandhi-hp-cong-leaders-file-fir-against-arnab-goswami/story-SCRtOHkeG6yRjhp32hGD2M.html)against Arnab Goswami in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Jammu & Kashmir. The complaints  mention offences under Sections 117, 120B, 153, 153A, 153B, 295A, 298, 500, 504, 505, 506 etc of the Indian Penal Code and Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000(IT Act) .  


S. 66A of the IT act, introduced by amendment in 2008, penalized sending ""offensive messages"" via online communication. The wide powers of the section were frequently used to stifle political dissent. For example, in May 2014,[ **five students were temporarily detained in Bangalore for allegedly sharing a message on the mobile application “WhatsApp” that was critical of newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi**](https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/05/24/stifling-dissent/criminalization-peaceful-expression-india).  To combat this a case was filed before the Supreme Court seeking a declaration that Section 66A of the IT Act, 2000 was unconstitutional.   


In March 2015, S.66A was declared unconstitutional by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in *Shreya Singhal v. Union Of India* as it violated the right to freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. The Court found that S. 66A was vague and could be arbitrarily interpreted to penalize even innocent speech. Significantly, the Court found that the provision was not ‘severable’ i.e., no part of the section could be saved and the provision as a whole was declared unconstitutional. This would have meant that the provision was void ab initio i.e was deemed to never have existed on the statute books. The effect of this would be that all pending cases would be dismissed and no fresh cases would be instituted under S. 66A.  


***#UnconstitutionalProsecutionsExposed***   
In light of the provision being declared unconstitutional, the story should have ended there. However, a 2018 study, ‘[**Section 66A and Other Legal Zombies**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3275893)’, highlighted the continued use of S. 66A, including cases registered after the Shreya Singhal decision.   


Taking note of the above-mentioned study, People's Union for Civil Liberties (‘PUCL’), one of the original petitioners in the Shreya Singhal Case approached the court in January, 2019 highlighting the study and applying for directions to ensure implementation of the Court's decision. Prior to the hearing, in a [**counter-affidavit,**](https://internetfreedom.in/section-66a-bites-the-zombie-dust-righttomeme-section66a/) the Union of India detailed steps it had taken to generate awareness on S. 66A. This included a letter the Government wrote on 11th January, 2019 and then a reminder on 14th January, 2019 to various state governments asking them to furnish data on S. 66A cases and also asking them to close them. Some states responded. For instance, [**Kerala stated that there were 19 cases that were filed after S. 66A was held to be unconstitutional**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/section-66a-information-technology-act-supreme-court-shreya-singhal-judgment-5599263/) and they would be closing all of them. The Court by judgement dated February 15, 2019, [**not only directed that all pending cases under S. 66A be closed but also that no fresh charges may be registered**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-directs-states-to-sensitise-cops-about-scrapping-of-section-66a-of-it-act/articleshow/68011762.cms). The SC further directed that  the Shreya Singhal judgement be sent to all courts in the country, to senior administrative officers and director generals of police.   


Inspite of the above, fresh claims were still instituted, as recently as last week, under the now unconstitutional provision. In January 2020, the [**Karnataka High Court imposed a cost of Rs 10,000 each on two police officers for registering an FIR under Section 66 A of the Information Technology Act**](https://thewire.in/law/karnataka-hc-section-66a-it-act). As recent as February 2020,[ **a guest lecturer at a college in Assam, was charged under S.66A of the IT Act**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-lecturer-held-for-facebook-post-on-delhi-violence/article30949145.ece), arrested and later sent to judicial custody for posting derogatory remarks against the BJP, the RSS, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and ‘Sanatan dharma’. In March 2020, [**the Patna High Court granted bail to two petitioners accused of offences, amongst others, under S.66A of the IT Act**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/159506330/). They had been in custody for 6 months. These instances highlight the continued invocation of S. 66A, 5 years after it was declared unconstitutional, despite further directions by the Supreme Court in 2019. This points to a systematic failure by the judiciary and law enforcement system.   


***#IFFBatsForDigitalRights***  
This is not about Arnab Goswami, but about the use of an unconstitutional provision of law. Even today people, ordinary smartphone users all across India are being prosecuted across the breadth of India. A casual search through the [**IndianKanoon database**](https://indiankanoon.org/search/?formInput=%22section+66a%22+sortby%3Amostrecent) (like Pintoo Kumar) shows cases of FIRs being actively prosecuted as recently as March, 2020. This is more than 5 years after a Supreme Court judgement and is a stain on our criminal justice system.   


We are committed to erasing Section 66A from every FIR and criminal case all across India, irrespective of the person who is being prosecuted. The journey of S. 66A highlights the importance and challenges of monitoring and ensuring compliance with the final decisions of the Supreme Court. To meet this challenge we have come up with a data driven, evidence based solution in partnership with [**CivicData Labs**](https://www.civicdatalab.in/). We will be working in partnership with CDL to build a tool to track cases under S. 66A at the district level between 1st January 2008 till 15th February 2020. We intend to analyse the data to identify and highlight the gaps in the system, put forth recommendations and advocate for a stronger, more accountable and transparent system. S. 66A must die a complete constitutional death.

**Tl;dr**

Multiple press reports have emerged on ""lists"" of persons placed under quarantine who are suspected to be infected with Covid-19. Many of these lists have been circulated on social media and WhatsApp groups, primarily those formed by Resident Welfare Associations and Group Housing Societies. The circulation of this information is a  breach of personal privacy and is exposing such quarantines to second order harms. To address it we have urged the Ministry of Health; Ministry of Urban Development and Housing; and  the National Real Estate Development Council (NARDECO) to urgently issue advisories.    


**Time to stop, spy the neighbour!**

It is day 6 of a national lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Repeated calls are being made public officials to maintain social solidarity and offer support. This spirit of social cooperation is jarring to the indiscriminate sharing of lists of persons who are suffering from Covid-19 infection; or, are suspected of being carriers; or, fall within a risk category due to recent travel. These lists of persons are being principally shared through digital means. This increases the field of dissemination of personally identifiable information and can lead to acute harm. 

Several press reports have emerged that such lists are being circulated on social media and WhatsApp groups, principally those formed by Resident Welfare Associations and Group Housing Societies. Further compounding this problem is that many of these lists seem to have been compiled by departments in State Governments and published on websites or, ""leaked"". 

These lists are not uniform and while may not contain the name of the person do contain personally identifiable information such as the addresses and the relatives of such persons. It is enabling discrimination, denial of essential health care and food items and even leading to instances where persons placed under quarantine are being placed under pressure of eviction by landlords and apartment societies.

Beyond a breach of law, is a poor public policy choice at the time of a pandemic. Sharing of information weakens social solidarity that is needed to counter this shared and unprecedented social challenge. It is literally turning neighbour against neighbour. 

We believe that state responses can be crafted while protecting the fundamental right to privacy as guaranteed under the Constitution.

318,32,212,Must Read : The plight of the Indian Farmer,33.0,fv88qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv88qa/must_read_the_plight_of_the_indian_farmer/,1.0,1586091536.0,"A few hundred miles from South Asia's glamour capital: Mumbai, a new day is marked by the lifeless body of another Indian farmer dangling from a peepul tree by a noose. More than 200,000 farmers have committed suicide in the last decade in Maharashtra's Vidarbha alone, an area the size of Portugal in central India. However, being an admirer of only the beautiful, the middle class Indian and their news, is carefully sanitized of any mention about these starving, sun-burnt wretches that cannot even afford the diet provided to one commercial European cow. The Indian farmer is invisible in life and in death. Thus, while his ripe, turgid oranges reach the gentleman's table, this abomination of a human being vanishes into obscurity, thrashed and ravaged by a burden of debt as the content hungry Indian media looks at the shopping malls and celebrity gossip to fill their pages.

I do not intend to ruin the appetite of my fine, educated compatriots on this forum, by whining the demise of a two penny cotton, orange farmer from India, I am here to enlighten you all on the ways of making these useless deaths profitable: the Monsanto way!

In the 1990s, Monsanto, ventured into India with its variety of genetically modified cotton seeds: BT cotton. In this introductory episode, I would skip the illegalities of Monsanto's field trials in India for which the Indian supreme court suspended Monsanto's Indian trading rights until 2001.

Fast forward to 2002: Monsanto's agents start approaching Vidarbha's farmers about these BT cotton seeds (later known as suicide seeds). The seeds were expensive, but Monsanto had already arranged with Indian banks for huge loan provisions to farmers who agreed. The farmers were promised unimaginable profits from these super-seeds, mostly verbally. Most importantly, Monsanto's agents were nice, personable and they actually addressed the Indian farmers as if they were human beings. When you are nice to the poor, you take away their bargaining power. Unable to read or write, these gullible, uneducated farmers put their thumb-print (in lieu of their signature) on Monsanto's agreement and approached banks for loans several times their annual revenue. The loans were all approved without any hurdle. The farmer was literally on a joyride, for the first time in several generations.

In the eyes of the erudite, this was a picture perfect move. In one sweep, millions of dollars of public money lying in the local banks became Monsanto's money, riding on shoulders of half-naked cotton farmers of Vidarbha.

Then reality struck: the crops failed, they failed miserably. When the farmers approached the same agents for answers, the attitude was different from last time. The agents pointed the illiterate farmer, who is unable to even sign his name, to a clause built into page x, line y of the initial document. The clause redeemed Monsanto of failed harvest unless the farmer had also bought Monsanto's very expensive fertilizer and pesticide as well. The news broke as hellfire on the destitute farmer that was already on the brink of devastation from three failed cotton harvests. There was no way for the farmer to afford these expensive fertilizers and pesticides.

Obviously, when the farmers approached the banks and local politicians on Monsanto's payroll, both referenced the same documents with the thumb print of the farmers and held the farmer alone responsible for their debt.

If you have decided to read on, let me warn you that there is no silver lining.

Until now, after each harvest, the farmers would save their indigenous seeds in local seed banks, but they have not sown indigenous for past several harvest cycles. So the older variety of indigenous seeds that the farmer sowed, are no longer to be found and worse still: Monsanto has bought over all the local seed banks. 99% of cotton exported by India is BT cotton, the indigenous varieties are all but extinct. These were the same indigenous cotton varieties that once clad Alexander’s army, the ancient Romans and the Egyptian Pharaohs. The native Indian cotton that led Europe into a global exploration for trade routes and set forth the age of explorations - is all but gone.

At this point, the Vidarbha farmers give up the fight, decide to swallow their loss and make the best of what they have. In the absence of indigenous seeds, they moved to sow the seeds from the previous Monsanto harvest. However, the friendly Monsanto agent came knocking back. The agent pointed again to another clause in the agreement that declares Monsanto's patent on the seeds and prohibits the farmers from re-sowing them. The farmer is flabbergasted, never before had they known that seeds can be patented. Farmer lobby groups took Monsanto to court. Obviously Monsanto prevailed.

Monsanto's victory over the naked starving Indian farmers was hugely celebrated in various disguise. Our very own Nature called it a ""boost for research"". 

The patriotic, nationalistic Modi government refuses to talk about farmer suicides. For several years, it refused to publish the suicide numbers. In Nov 2018 when a huge rally of Indian farmers marched to Delhi begging for their justice and relief, they were flogged and shot at by the Indian police, and not one mainstream Indian media covered the story.

The memoirs of Warren Hastings, the Governor General of India 1773-85, describes the Indian famine caused by atrocious policies of another multinational corporation: The British East India Trading Company (EIC). Starving farmers would come to the city in the vain hope of finding leftovers discarded by the opulent employees of EIC. Starving and diseased, the Indian farmers are an ungainly sight for three centuries now. As the British sepoy would kick these wretched souls lining the street side, the farmer would cry out in agony: ""Baba!, baba!"": ""father, father"","" your countrymen have brought me to such misery, if it pleases you, I want to breath my last in your presence"". Like yesterday, the common people is just as engrossed in fighting each other and rioting, to be able to see the real evil plaguing them. India may have gained its own flag, but it is far from being independent.",2020.0,4.0,5.0,18:43:56,justice,85

### Tl;dr

Foundation for Media Professionals had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir on 31 March 2020. The petition was finally listed for hearing today i.e. 9 April 2020 before a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J. During the hearing, the bench issued notice and the matter will be heard next after one week. 

### Background

Foundation for Media Professionals had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir on 31 March 2020. The petition contended that the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 crisis violated fundamental rights to healthcare, education, livelihood and justice guaranteed by the Constitution of India. 

Despite the COVID-19 crisis gripping the country, the government has continued directing internet service providers to slow down internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G by citing security concerns. The most recent of these orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 was issued on [**03 April 2020**](http://jkhome.nic.in/22(TSTS)of2020.pdf) and it is due to expire on 15 April 2020.

2G is an outdated technology which was phased out in 2008 with the launch of 3G, and most modern websites and applications are too heavy to properly run on a 2G internet connection. While 4G internet services provide download speed of 150-300 Mbps, 2G internet services only provide download speed of upto 384 Kbps.

Due to denial of 4G internet services, healthcare professionals and ordinary people in Jammu & Kashmir have been unable to access the latest information about treatment and management of COVID-19 and relief measures. Further, patients are forced to flock to hospitals, which are hotbeds of infection, to consult doctors about COVID-19 and other ailments. This is because 2G internet services cannot support telemedicine which requires video to visually examine the patient.

In addition to its impact on healthcare, the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir is also preventing children from continuing their education through online tools. Children in the region have already suffered major disruption to their education due to the communication shutdown and lockdown imposed on 05 August 2019 after abrogation of Article 370. The COVID-19 crisis has forced schools to shut down again after re-opening earlier this year.

The government has fully embraced use of technology to combat the pandemic and it has launched a COVID-19 dashboard, WhatsApp chatbot and contact tracing app to widely disseminate accurate and latest information to the public and track spread of the disease. However, at 2G speed, the people of Jammu & Kashmir may be unable to access life saving information through these tools. For instance, the WhatsApp chatbot responds to queries with text, infographics and videos but downloading images and videos is difficult without 4G internet services.

### Hearing before Supreme Court

During today's hearing, a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J. issued notice to the standing counsel of Jammu & Kashmir and listed the matter for hearing after one week. This was the same bench which had earlier decided [***Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India***](https://internetfreedom.in/scs-judgement-on-kashmir-communication-is-just-the-beginning/), which related to the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu & Kashmir on 05 August 2019.

Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi represented the Foundation for Media Professionals during the hearing and we are extremely grateful to him for his efforts. We would also like to thank the wider legal team comprising of Advocate on Record, Shadan Farasat and Advocates, Vrinda Bhandari, Jahnavi Sindhu, Gautam Bhatia and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay who worked on this petition. IFF’s Executive Director and Advocate, Apar Gupta was also personally present with the Senior Advocate during today’s hearing which happened via video conferencing.

No idea how they did this, or what our options are, hopefully the bank will be cooperative tomorrow morning.
And for the scammers - no amount of expletives do justice to how low they can fall by stealing from others, especially in times which are tense and stressful enough. Seriously, who thinks this is a good time to steal ?
Anyway, rant aside, if anyone has any advice or helpful tips on how we can retrieve the money - please please let me know.
Thanks and stay safe out there 🙏🏽",2020.0,3.0,30.0,11:30:10,justice,12

Workers are struggling to put food on the table, businessmen are in deep trouble with no sales for 2-3 months. There’s chaos and confusion which I believe will continue for another 3-6 months. 

In the short term this will destroy business and people’s life economically as savings would dwindle and debt would rise. Our smart and intelligent FM has provided debt as an ammunition to the people and business in these times. That’s ~80% of the bees lakh cr. 

Debt is like a slow poison which will prolong death instead of killing instantly. 

Some examples:

1. There’s already increase in thefts, robberies in factories (anecdotal) by workers and other thieves

2. Delhi viral video of mango seller and loot of food kiosks in railway station is clear giveaway that no one can stop them 

3. There’s rampant theft but that’s getting under reported in the overarching crisis

Discussion:
1. Do you see renaissance/revolution kinda event ? 

2. Do you anticipate increase in crime rate which includes chain/mobile snatching, mugging, house/premise breakins?

3. More white collar crime by employees to support their debt due to pay cuts, salary/bonus freezes

4. Rampant cheating by businessmen to support their business. For ex. I know Builders are gonna cheat every buyer by delaying the projects forever or not returning money 

5. More sophisticated/violent crime with weapons just for the sake of money",2020.0,5.0,24.0,13:53:05,robbery,

However, when Compared to China

* we have significantly weaker healthcare system

* we don't have the industrial base to produce essential material required for this crisis domestically. See Ventilators, pharmaceuticals and face masks

Right now, the situation hasn't gone out of  hands completely. However if the current trajectory Continues, exponential growth will ensure we will reach point of no return in a few weeks

In my opinion, we need to learn from other countries

* Declare a national lockdown all over the country. No one steps out of their house for any reason until the government specifies. Use all state resources to ensure strict lockdown. 


* Order all offices, organisations, public places shut until this emergency is under control 

* Issue a government law making it illegal for all private organisations to resume their work until the government specifies. Make it illegal to fire any employee or contracted workforce until this emergency is over. 


* For those who don't have any home, nationalise hotels and any other buildings which can be used to house the homeless people, until this crisis is over 


* Deploy the national disaster relief team and army to carry out door to door distribution of ration and water  to those who don't have money to buy food. This will ensure that people can stay indoors comfortably. 



* Nationalise all private hospitals and pharmaceutical companies until this emergency tides over. Until then, ensure all hospital care and medicines are free of cost at entry point for everyone. 


* Deploy the army to carry out testing and to  implement quarantine measures. Start mass testing on a war footing. 


* Temporarily release all prisoners who are jailed for non serious crimes like white collar crimes, robbery etc etc. Early release those convicts who were going to be released soon anyways. Indian prisons are extremely overcrowded. If infection takes a hold there, it will be a disaster for all the prisoners. 


* Stop all foreign  incoming traffic via air, ship and land to India. Seal all borders. Even those Indians who are currently outside should not be allowed to leave airport when they arrive. Isolate them until they are cleared as safe.


The window of opportunity is closing fast. Yes these measures will tank the economy completely for this quarter or even this year, but human lives are more essential then a few gdp points . If we don't do anything now, it will just become worse in future",2020.0,3.0,18.0,04:01:43,robbery,

Once corona patients are admitted to hospitals, no communication is received till the patient dies or recovers.

If the patient dies, he may not even get reason as covid 19 in his death certificate since state government are trying to suppress deaths. But whole of his family is forcefully taken into quarantine centre. Their house is locked and left unguarded. Many robberies are taking place due to this.

If relatives happen to become corona positive, they will be admitted to hospitals and same process as above will repeat.

Government does not have a clear plan on what to do with corona dead bodies. If they hand over it to relative, they are unable to carry the patients to their home or near by funeral centres due to corona stigmas.

If there is no nearby funeral centre, even hospital would not want to take risk of taking care of cremation. Hospital also would not want to use those dead bodies for lab.

If the family recovers from corona, they are not allowed back to the village/society, even though, they are showing certificate of recovery from the hospital. They are forced to go in hiding.

Now, even in lock down period, cases doubling up every 9 days, India will soon have few lakhs cases.

The mismanagement will cost more life than the corona itself.

What is your suggestion to improve the situation.",2020.0,4.0,26.0,04:46:28,robbery,19

There are several of us who may have been offered to work from home, however, there is a huge population of workers out there who can’t afford to be at home. Especially, the ones that are barely just making ends meet - househelps, drivers, food delivery guys, rickshaw pullers, street hawkers, daily wage earners etc. How can we help these folks? They are not thinking about ration hoarding, sanitary needs, self quarantine. How do we help them?

The nature of disease is such that it requires social distancing. However, I do not believe this social distancing should dampen any humanity and the value of human connection. It should not turn us all into cold hearted panic stricken head less chickens. We need to think. We need to think for the most vulnerable and the economically impoverished.

India is not a western style country. We do not truly have a great social welfare system, and, even when government comes out with welfare schemes .. the distribution of these schemes is neither efficient nor effective. Given the cards we are dealt with, I sincerely believe that Covid 19 pandemic will cause more economic damage than anything else, and it’d be hard especially on the poor.

We need to center ourselves and collectively think about helping the most vulnerable ones. 

A small anecdote as I wind up - In 2005, when hurricane Katrina hit - there were stories of robberies in the houses and business properties. People acted on looting when they needed to be their best humanitarian self.

Whereas, almost every year when rain floods strike Mumbai, it is very well known and documented, that a lot of Mumbaikars help out people stranded in traffic due to floods.

An incident vaguely similar to this happened with me a year ago although now all is well. So I am asking. I am an average adult male.

For example, if I am just petting a dog alone in a corner with no one around. A harasser who is frustrated against me for no real reason comes up to me and says ""Haan bhai. Bohot hero banna hai tujhe? Chal bata. Tere dost kahan hain?"" (Or insert any random question that this psychopath asks which I am not obliged to answer,) (Allright bro, so you want to become a hero? Tell me. Where are your friends?)

I avoid him and go to some other place.

But he follows me and says "" Kahan jaa raha hai bhai. Poocha na tujhe se. Bata chal. Dost kahan hai tere. Aukat mein reh samjha na. Jaat hain hum ra tau. Humse akad mein na re. Pyaar se poochre. Chal bata. Kahan hai dost. (Where are you going bro? I asked you know? Tell me. Where are your friends? My relative is a jaat. Do not act so stubborn with us. We are asking you nicely. Now tell me. Where are your friends?)

I avoid again and walk somewhere else.

But this man approaches me again and repeats the process. What annoys me is not the empty threat which I know a random guy with no police/political connections will not act upon. What annoys me is the the fact that he is ruining my peace of mind even when I asked him to stay away. Also, I want to know the difference in the way to deal if such harasser is your own family member/relative vs such harasser being a stranger.


 He is doing it possibly because even if I enough time to report in police, the police might just suppress such trivial matter by saying to this psychopath ""Haan bhai. Pareshan karra hai too use? Tameej me reh. Nahi toh lockup mein daal denge tujhe"" (Hey dude, you are annoying him? Stay in your limits or we will throw you in the lockup)

To which crazy dude would reply ""Are sir majaak mein keh rahe the ye toh boora man gaye"" (Sir I was just playing around. I don't know why he is so offended?)

The police would then look at me and say ""Yeh firse karta hai toh ap mujhe bataein"" (If he does it again, please let us know)

Also, if this harasser happens to have some connections in police or politics, it would be even more difficult to avoid him.

So I am an ordinary guy. Geek looks. Not threatening by physique at all. Now what I am curious is some idea possible for a common man like me that will allow me to prevent such harasser from approaching me or even if he approaches and gives me the threat, an idea I can use to make him stop instantly from harassing me in his different ways.


Usually, people refrain from doing those acts which can land them up in prison. For example, theft or murder.

But there are certain cases where the police frees the offender if the actions by him are of a minor nuisance and there is no evidence. This motivates the offender to commit these acts of nuisance as much as he can. I remember reading a provision of public nuisance in Indian Penal code, but do not know how seriously the police takes them in reality.

So let ne know the fix for such situations.",2020.0,5.0,26.0,05:54:14,harassment,

I use a bicycle to travel to work. So en-route as I reached one of the traffic lights, there was this guy on some 4-5 year old splender idling his bike on zebra crossing.

I stopped some 1/2 feet  before zebra crossing. Now we we were the only two guys on that side. Some 15 seconds later a girl on activa stops next to me before zebra crossings.

Now this guy starts revving up his engine and started looking back towards his silencer as if checking that there is something wrong with his bike. There was nothing wrong - no black or white smoke. He was just checking out the girl. Then this guy slowly started reversing his bike and placed it before the zebra crossing between me and that girl and kept revving his bike for other 20 sec till lights turned green. 

Whille he was reversing and revving I had a feeling that he was doing this as a show-off. The girl and I happened to look at each other and her expression seemed to say ""yes I know what he is doing"" as if reading my mind.

As the light turned green they happen to turn in different directions and that guy might have followed her if they were going the same way, I relaxed a bit but it creeped me out.

I will not try to be holier than thou. I also checkout girls and I am sure girls also checkout boys - which is normal. But I do that very discreetly and never have been the one indulging in catcalling or someone who stares till the girl disappears in the crowd or ""ghar tak chod kar ayenge"" types.

It is normal to checkout individuals from opposite gender but catcalling and staring to make other person uncomfortable is not.

We Indian men need to understand this.


Edit 1:

Seems like this post has divided opinions.

A) Some people are shouting out about this post being generalising for all Indian men.

I want to make it very clear -

I pointed out the issue and not singled out the person.

 when I used the term ""Indian men"" I was referring to those who indulge in such attention seeking gimmicks. And if you do not do that I didn't call you out.

And if you are not satisfied now, then come let's nitpick the skin from hair. 

B) There are others who are taking the side of the other guy and are pointing out that it may just have been an issue with his bike.

Which is a fair point. But is based on presumption.
And for that I would say two things:


        1) I develop engines and can tell you if something is wrong with the engine. I am very sure everything was fine with that bike.



        2) This happened in chandigarh and if you have a idea about Gedi culture here you will know what such signals are meant for. And I know what that meant

C) Lastly, those who understood this thanks for trying to reason with others

Hear me out and answer this honestly to  yourself (do not post here if your ego hurts).
Whenever you go out with your girlfriend, sister or any female relative of yours don't you always have to look out for male leching?

If you do not then you are living in a really good place my friend. But if you do that ,then what you are assuming is that all men will want to look at them. You yourself think that sub-consciously that ""All men will do this"".

And yet men like you are here trying to sound cool by putting forward an irrational argument that is essentially disguised form of saying I didn't do this. What shall i do with that? where does that lead?",2020.0,3.0,15.0,06:35:01,harassment,15

My family has been harassed by a scammer online. He was constantly resetting our phones and was also able to record calls.

Scammer was able to remotely access our phone's microphones and send us recordings for the same or email us details which we as a family were discussing in our living room.

Tonight, he got access to a phone which had a lot of family pictures. Scammer has created a lot of pornographic images using our family photos. Scammer is blackmailing us now to either pay up or he will release those images in our close and extended family.

I have already been to the police and they are not of much help. The crime was reported online with cybercell but since I live in small city the file hasn't reached our local police station yet.

You may disagree with what I say, but please do read this once and then maybe leave a comment on whether you agree or not, and why. Just don't downvote the post and fuck off, let's have a proper discussion. Here goes.

Those boys have a depraved mentality. They are sick and I hope they grow the fuck up, they are sixteen and seventeen, for fuck's sake. I think a sixteen-year-old is in the tenth standard. I remember my tenth. I was surrounded by boys like that, maybe even some girls. And I am from one of the better schools in Delhi. This kind of shitty talk was not super common, but it was still there. It mostly originates from the biggest troublemakers in class, they all used to be a part of a group. Like attracts like, I guess. They talked shit about girls, there was objectification and very inappropriate language. They even talked shit about teachers and it infuriated me. They used to talk like that every day. Their group reinforced such behaviour. They were carefree and arrogant. I maintained my distance from them, but I don't think I would call them as bad as rapists or criminals. I don't have any interaction with those kids from my school now, so I don't know if they matured, but I sure hope they did.

The point is, kids in high school are fucked in the brain. They don't think twice before spewing shit. But they say shit because they don't think there will be repercussions. They would not dare say that shit to a girl's face when repercussions are guaranteed. They don't mean half of the shit they say. Those boys in the group chat did not send inappropriate DM to girls. They did not harass any girl. They said horrible shit amongst themselves because they thought it was okay. But as far as I am aware, everything was inside that group chat. I am not sure if they exchanged ""morphed"" photos of underage girls, but if they did, then it probably qualifies as a criminal offence and they are rightfully fucked. But from the screenshots that I saw, they were exchanging fully clothed photos of girls. Why is that a problem? People objectify celebrities, is that okay? Celebrities get paid to be objectified, is that okay?

Also, just for the record, **the separate Snapchat incident where someone said they will ""rape"" someone, was completely wrong**. Conspiring harm upon someone is not okay, and I think legal action has been initiated against him.

We need to understand that thinking and saying are NOT the same as taking action. Having a depraved mentality is not a crime, taking action on it is. Condemn the mentality, but saying something that you find offensive is not a crime. You don't jail a paedophile for being attracted to kids, you jail them for acting on that desire. There are porn subreddits and porn videos where horny people will comment nasty shit, but it's all a fantasy, a desire, and nothing else. If someone likes crime or action movies, it does not mean they are capable of committing that crime or beating people.

Moving on to why a teenager would feel the need to say shit like that, it takes us to the biggest issue at hand–how we can change this mentality of objectifying people, especially women, as a society. It didn't start with this group chat nor would it end with them. I used to think good education will solve these fundamental issues, but I am not so sure now. This is what we should be talking about instead of just shaming those pricks.",2020.0,5.0,5.0,04:37:02,harassment,

There are offices where senior managers harass / shout at juniors, there are colleges where senior students rag juniors, there are school teachers who make fun of students who are not so good at studies and so on.

In many of the cases, I have seen that seniors harass juniors only because they were themselves harassed in the past by their own seniors. Many managers pick up the habit of shouting at juniors because they were shouted at too, when they were juniors. Do you see the problem here? - This cycle is never going to stop. One able person will harass another - this person will then harass someone else  and this will keep continuing.

So here is my request - BREAK THE CHAIN. Try to be polite to people (especially juniors around you). Try not to vent out your frustration on your maid. When you shout on her, she may not reply you, but she is definitely going to shout at someone else that day to vent out her frustration (perhaps she might shout at her kids).

I am an engineer graduated from a tier-1 college in 2018 but due to some bad luck crisis failed to establish a proper career and i am currently out of job and in need of a one.

Why i specifically ask for decent paying is because my family business is totally going in loss due to corona and income is almost going zero even our workers aren't cooperating and we have some emis too.

I know basics of data science and programming and have an experience in rdp(remote desktop servers) could even learn more things but need to get atleast an 10lpa job to take care of my family. 

I know it might sound unusual but i have seen many freshers having a ctc of 20+ lpa with just data sciene or excellent knowledge of DSA so i was thinking if i could score the same. If anybody has any idea or knowledge that could help me please share and help.

This part here(can be ignored if you don't want the details) explains some of the problems which led to the downfall to the initial phase of my career.

I graduated in 2018 in ECE but my father got severely ill had high sugar and bp lost huge weight which literally got me scared and we already were discussing whether i should go for my joining in Bangalore for 6 lpa ctc or should look over something else so during that time i thought to stay with my family only as this was the first time i saw my father at such a down moment and i easily helped him in business by handling on behalf.

Over a period of 2 months my father got quite good so i started fully preparing for cat and other MBA exams and in 2019 i had my interviews but i suffered from an accident and got my back and leg heavily injured and was on bed rest for a very long time which literally destroyed my career.

After i almost recovered i joined an startup in my hometown so that my routine changes and i start doing productive things and get my body back on track but this year January due to some problems with my boss i left the job and started preparing for data science and data structures as one of my friend told me he will refer me in his company so i should prepare all these things but now after corona he says there is no vacancy right now and he has left his job because his manger was literally harassing him and he is taking a break from all these things for some months so i don't know what should be my next step.

Since government is so local police claimed traveling without Lockdown #2 pass is not allowed, hence the pass. 

My father works in bank and travels with his bike to work. Despite no problem other than minor stop and check during first phase of lockdown, he was stopped today and asked for pass and documents but even then Police fined him.

He was given 2 options  seizure of hi bike or pay challan. He paid the challan of course but fact remains he had necessary travel pass, a copy of government circular allowing his movement, his bank document.

If this is how so called ""essential workers"" are harassed, how will they do their work. But I shouldn't be surprised though given even doctors have been beaten, evicted and worse.

**TLDR: internet was out, so me and my colleague were working through our phones, i manage to find all the candidates for a job client, suddnely boss comes up, goes off about us lazing around not working. i fought back that he blindly can't just allege that we were not working. he tells us to give resignation letter and a apology letter for misbehaviour. i give the resignation letter, but was not budging for apology letter. he threatened that he would send my CV to gandhinagar(state capital) to ruin my career. i got scared and wrote an apology letter.. i dont know who exactly he would have sent this to at state capital.some sort of union? do i  have not options and just be beaten around with such foul powerplay? what are my options legally? and what can he do exactly as an employer/boss? i am a bit all over the place. i have to work till the end of the month. service my notice period right now.**

Ever since the start of my serving term here, i have been a victim of ***attempted*** bullying, but i have been firm enough to not get bogged down, and have been keeping him in check.

**Little workplace background**
Its a small HR recruitment firm which happens to be right on the second floor of his house. Comprises of the Boss himself, and two female employees including me.

This is my third month since joining.

**Couple incidents that took place below**

* I put the reporting sheet back on deck in his cabin, as i am walking out the cabin, he calls me back, and with condescension, he says, ""Do you not know why i hire female employees? because they are known to keep things organized, now unless you are a guy, i expect such tardiness from you. Or maybe you are a recently changed-to female from man? had your gender changed?""

* We do reporting every day at the end. My end time is 7 PM. Now I'd have my report ready, but the guy would quite intentionally would only start looking at reports at or after 7PM. And when i leave i am made to hear all sorts of comments that i am unprofessional/ or ""itni jaldi kyu hai ghar jaane ki"".. I mean i finished my shift what else am i supposed to stand for.

* I find all the possible candidates that i am asked for based on requirements, and pass them all off to him. When the company isnt doing well i am lambasted that because of me its not doing well, and he expects me listen all of that BS like a monk which i dont. it is upon him to further pass the profiles i sent him to the client company HR folks yet he 50% of the time never, infact half the time, he would walk down the stairs and have his luxurious naps in the afternoon. So as per him i am rude because i dont listen to him blasting me verbally for things i am not reponsible for.

* He keeps trying to get a little close, i once averted his random handshake because i found it odd, he tells me i dont what professionalism is, and then lately keeps asking my husband's salary i dont know why...

I'm from New Delhi and my parent works in a bank as an essential services worker. They do not have the option to remain inside even though they want to. I've been staying inside the house for the past week even before the lockdown happened and have been preparing for the past few weeks.

Now with the metro shut, and the buses running at such a low capacity, it is near impossible for her(changing 2-3 buses at least) to reach the office which is about 9-10 Kms from our place. While going to drop her, we were stopped a couple times but since she had her ID, we were allowed the pass.

Then, coming back it was nightmare! Being a guy alone, I was stopped at every single checkpoint and was harassed even after explaining where I was each time. This somehow has to stop! Even showing the picture of her ID didn't work. Not everyone wants to go out, given a choice, I'd stay home and be happy isolated away from the fucked up world currently. 

It's understandable that they're out their protecting people, however, it doesn't mean they can do as they please. If someone is genuinely trying to explain their issue, they should be more understanding rather than showing the attitude where they just don't listen. Empathy isn't that hard but they show zero EQ whatsoever! People shouldn't be scared of them unless they're doing something wrong. It's the opposite though, for a normal person, being stopped by them is having a mini heart attack (maybe not that extreme but you know what I mean).

I'm afraid I'll get a fine/challan on my name even though I did nothing wrong and was only making sure the safety of my parent so she can help people like them to get their salaries on time! If the bank is closed, they will probably be the first ones to complain. Promoting digital India is a facade if more than half the population is unable to check their bank balance themselves!

Under any one of Donald Trumps tweets you will find hoards of Indians venerating him and congratulating him for his policies against Muslims or celebrating his friendship with Modi. 

And the wave of anti-Chinese bigotry, perpetrated by racist whites in response to the coronavirus, has swept up India in such a frenzy that even Indian North-easterners are not safe from attacks and harassment due to having oriental features. 

There is such a innate desire for Hindu-nationalists to make sure that they are on the same side of every issue as white supremacists as both of them see their own community as being inherently better than the rest and therefore united in their contempt for the rest.

But the one key difference between the two groups is all of this ethno-nationalist bravado projected by the Indian government and its Hindu-nationalist supporters falls to the wayside when Donald Trump threatens retaliation against India for putting its own self interest before that of the white supremacists.

It’s almost as if they have accepted their status as being above the Chinese, the Muslims, etc but subconsciously they have accepted the rule of the white man over them. 

It’s not a surprise that over the course of his tenure, as India tries to contort and bend to appease him, Donald Trump treats India with almost a sense of restrained contempt. 

“For many years India has taken advantage of the US in terms of trade” - On trade

“If they were to disallow the drug from being exported to the US there maybe be retaliation, off course there would be retaliation” - On Hydrochloroquine

“And we're supposed to say, 'Oh, thank you for the library.' I don't know who's using it in Afghanistan” - On India’s role in Afghanistan

“ Our relationship with Pakistan is a very good one. Thanks to these efforts, we are beginning to see signs of big progress with Pakistan” - On Namaste Trump In Ahmedabad

“Tariff King"" - On India’s local industries 

While the barrage of pettiness and hate, that is reserved for countries like Bangladesh, Malaysia, Turkey and others in India’s more immediate neighborhood, is released the moment any of them dare to say something slightly critical of India, somehow this strong and aggressive Hindu-nationalist government almost always just cowers down to the US and complies accordingly to all their threats and requests. And it’s not as if they do it begrudgingly, their supporters continue to revere and look at the White House as a friend and well wisher.",2020.0,4.0,8.0,06:55:54,harassment,

What are the potential sources to get the stats on the number of sedition cases registered and the number of actual convictions in india during the past 10 years?

As we all know this particular section is one of the most abused provisions in the IPC by all parties/governments in power to stifle criticism. It should also be kept in mind that the supreme court (when it was actually functioning) in the 1950s itself made it clear that it is the duty of every citizen to criticize governments and this can't be seen as sedition. Sedition could be used only when someone makes explicit attempts to overthrow the state or make calls for armed rebellion against the state, but in practice we all know that this is not how it works.

Thus I think it will be interesting to get the above mentioned stats to get an idea about how widely and frequently abused this provision is and how governments/police use it to harass dissenters. Please do provide your suggestions regarding how to obtain these statistics on a pan India scale.

Thank you.",2020.0,5.0,29.0,02:09:43,harassment,10

1. The women in the gang would've already filed for sexual harassment, profanity and indecent behaviour even before the heist..

2. Moscow in his death bed would've revealed Monika was Denver's step sister 🤷🏽‍♂️

3. Professor starts taking class. The bitch Tokyo will already be messing since she hates Berlin and isn't in charge of the heist. Rio is terribly in love that he never listens to any class or keeps bunking classes and blindly listens to anything Tokyo says . Tokyo plans a riot against professor and Berlin. The plan is ruined. 

4. The female hostages would demand a separate accommodation.

5. Don't even think of the hostages changing to jumpsuits scene to be so smooth, everyone would demand a privacy 😁

6. Everyone, even after the 11th day would still have the perfect hair, makeup and those who have torn suits would have it in the right places to show off THEIR perfect biceps, abs  chest etc 😃

7. Also there would be atleast a 2 dream sequence songs.

8. Boman Irani would play Arturo Roman 

9. Their hideout during the 6 month training period would be in Leh/Ladakh or Darjeeling. 

10. Dali masks to replaced by that of BigB or Sachin Tendulkar.

11. And all this Smoking /Drinking and Abuse against women disclaimers.

12. After the success of Season 2. The role of Professor would be played by Salman Khan or Aamir Khan and Katrina Kaif or Sonakshi would replace Tokyo/Nairobi in the subsequent seasons.
Role of Stockholm would be reserved for a newcomer - Probably a Star Kid..Ananya Pandey or Jhanvi Kapoor?? Coz you need to reserve one for Nepotism!

13. Modiji would've gone for Demonetization 2.0, the day after the heist is complete. #MasterStroke

In india many old school parents believe in this thing called the caste system. This system essentially is a hierarchy system them used back in the day divides indians based on their economic/societal hierarchy. Obviously this system cant, and does not hold true to today as times have changed. So my parents said no to him, and they wont give me a an exact reason and keep brushing it off when i ask. My mom shuns me and yells at me on the phone and basically dosent want me to have my own opinion.  



Now My sister is also a Narcissist and she harasses me alot. She says i wont listen to our parents and caused our family lot of pain, shame, and regret. She constantly berates, and tries to shame me. She thinks what im doing is wrong and dosent agree with me. She also tried to get my parents to say no before they even met him. i dont know why. Shes always blaming and berating me and its so hard for me to talk to her. Then sometimes she comes out of the blue and talks like everything is normal and talks like were close or something. Shes gone so far as to the point where she said shes wants to harm herself because of me. I literally dont say anything to her and i avoid talking to her because all she does is yell at me.

It is a secondary language in my country. I (32M) feel lost in this world especially among my family. In 2014, my then gf blurted to her family about our relationship and was being forced to marry anyone else against her will. We (more like her) decided to tie the knot in a hurry and the next month of 2014 we were already married.

My (33F) wife is banker and somehow a totally different being than my parents (both 59yrs). From day one, they hate each other. Living under one roof with separate rooms worsened the scenario. It took a toll on our marriage as well and there were several weeks of zero physical contact between me and my wife. My parents like to talk things out while my wife likes the silent method of letting things resolve on their own. Two polar opposites. 

We (me and my parents) bought our new house in 2013 when we realised that the house we booked 14 years ago, did not take shape until 2019 when the construction commenced. Hence, have a large mortgage, soon later got married and then the unthinkable struck (me) - a series of perianal abscess episodes, surgeries, recovery and repeat  that lasted 3 whole years. 

In 2015, over a series of fights, my banker wife decided to take a promotion in another city. She wanted me to move out with her but my butt health had me sticking to my house. She's been supporting her parents and brother, both physically and financially. Her money, her choice! But, then she's stopped calling my parents altogether. They barely wish each other on their birthdays. She talks to me on a regular basis but it's usually a game of sarcasm. 

Thanks to the health crisis, I could barely sit at work the entire work day and due to 4 surgeries, one each year, my career is a mess. Once while searching for a new job, out of boredom, depression or pure horniness, I matched with a single mother and we had a NSA encounter.

Little did I know that the woman would go crazy over a dick and make my life a living hell. I clearly mentioned that I was married and was just horny. She agreed back then but stole my identity and later started living a fake life claiming to be my wife and claiming her kid of 6 years is mine. Like wtf! In India, laws are flawed. Women are queens here as they do not require proofs for complaints, their word is enough. Men on the other hand, despite proving that her documents are fake and that it was a casual encounter with facts on the table, I was repeatedly questioned by authorities for my own complaint of identity theft and harrasment over 3 years.

That woman has hijacked my life knowing that my wife does not stay with me. Blackmails turned frauds and no matter how much I've been pleading the authorities, the only answer I get is - If she wants money, ask her how much! Why should I give money to someone who agreed to everything and duped me later. Also, money is a scarcity with no medical insurance renewal thanks to the surgeries. 

In the midst of it all, I confessed about my wrong deeds to both my parents and wife. They were super pissed and my wife wanted a divorce. I wanted to end my life but I did respect her decision. Later, she told me that she loved me more than all the mess of this world and that she forgives but won't forget. We went back to being together but more like a long distance relationship of about 3 years now.

I just had my ""potentially"" last fistula and abscess surgery a week ago and recovery period is scheduled for 2 months. The harassing woman is a daily menace and has been reported across cyber crime, local authorities, but continues to threaten. My wife stays 400kms away in another city. My parents are burdened with the house expenses and I feel helpless lying with a torn butt waiting to recover.

The harassing woman aside, I do not know how do I handle my married life! I don't want to make a choice between my parents and my wife. I love them both. My parents think that I should divorce my wife and start afresh. I love my wife more after the heartfelt confession and talks we had about a couple of years ago. My wife wants to start a family of our own with kids and a new house. Truth be told, she does not contribute to any finances despite earning since over a decade.

I am not sure, if I can handle two (third being constructed) house expenses with a kid being planned by wife. Seems like a huge mess and no way out. I feel stuck, confused, harassed, depressed but want it all to sort out somehow. I could have hid the NSA encounter but it is a major goof up and I regret it.

Any suggestions on how to handle it all? I am lost dealing with pain on a hospital bed almost blowing my life's savings on my butt surgeries and recovery.


Tldr: Wife and parents don't get along. Wife stays in a different city since 3-4 years now and wants to start a new family when she returns to our city. Goofed up once and now being blackmailed by the goof up! Down with health and wealth. Need suggestions on how to get back a decent life.",2020.0,3.0,15.0,22:48:46,harassment,32

Out of these 456, there were 128 Nepalese, and 50% were under 18 years of age.

But when Mumbai Police contacted Nepalese Govt, they refused to help them bring back to their country, because they had no birth certificates. It was an even worst situation for those 128 Nepalese girls.

Neither they can be in India, nor reach Nepal.

It was then that Suniel Shetty took the matters into his own hands. He booked tickets for all 128 Nepalese girls, made arrangements for their departure from India and ensured that they reach home safely.

And the biggest part.. He kept silent on his heroic deed for 24 years, since revealing this incident and the names would have jeopardized those girls' future.

This was recently revealed by Charimaya Tamang, one of the survivors of that raid 24 years ago. In an interview with Vice, she revealed for the first time how Suniel Shetty helped them, and saved their dignity.

Charimaya now runs an NGO which works against sex trafficking and the rehabilitation of the survivors and has won Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2013.

One act of kindness by Suniel Shetty, without any media hype and drama, changed the lives of those 128 women, and triggered a change and movement which will continue to help and support thousands of more women.

Big salute to Suneil Shetty, and his selfless act. Simple incredible!

Makiko Kimura in her book The Nellie Massacre of 1983: Agency of Rioters writes that “150,000 armed men in uniform were in place to ensure law and order — one army man for 57 voters — turning Assam into a military battleground rather than a political state suitable to democratically elect political representatives.”

In 1983, during Assam election, the centre oppose the deletion of name of ""foreigner"" (people from Bangladesh who got citizenship in India). The All Assam Students' Union (AASU) opposed the inclusion of foreigners.

Even though talk between Indira Gandhi and AASU was inconclusive, the centre went ahead with holding election. The AASU protest to not hold election and due to this protest Hindu Muslim relation deteriorated, leading to Nellie Massacre. 

Reports from the Tewari Commission that conducted an official enquiry into the riots note that between January 1983 and March 1983, 545 attacks took place on roads and bridges, and over 100 kidnapping incidents were registered.

It said that 290 incidents of police firing and lathi charge — in order to curb the agitation — were reported in Assam.


In order to ensure security during the polling, around 65 battalions of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), along with several other forces, moved into the state.

However, the forces were not of much use as they were unaccustomed to the terrain, the locals as well as their language. They were forced to depend on the local police for guidance, who were hostile.

It started in a systematic manner in Borbori village on the morning of 18 February, 1983. Nellie and 13 other villages were surrounded by a mob armed with guns and machetes.

In the bloodbath that followed, over 1,800 people were reported killed while the unofficial death toll is as high as 5,000.

Two years after this masscare, Assam Accord was signed by Rajiv Gandhi.

##Arjuna was Once Killed by his Own Son. 

Arjun have one son from Chitragandha named Baburvuhana. During his exile of 12 Years(after he entered in Draupadi room without her permission) Arjun sees Princess of Manipur and Fell in Love with her. He asks her Father King Chitravahana for her Hand then he puts condition for Arjun that his Son Born from Chitragandha will become king of Manipur as King have no Son. They spend time till Chitragandha Gives Birth to Son. 

After so Many years of Epic War Pandav arrange  Ashvamedha yagna, where a decorated horse would be sent across the kingdom and wherever it goes unopposed, the land would be acquired by the king who sent it. Arjuna was tasked to take care of the horse. When Arjuna went to Manipura with the wandering sacrificial horse of the Aswamedha, Babruvahana captured the horse, which, by tradition, meant war against the Pandavas. Arjuna tried to persuade Babruvahana to leave the horse as there was no enmity between Manipura and Hastinapura. Babruvanahana agreed with Arjuna but informed him that he wished to defeat Arjuna for his Guru Dakshina.[3] Arjuna, reluctant to fight a young boy, left and informed a small troop of his army to convince Babruvahana to give the horse back. Babruvahana defeated the army. He also defeated Bheema. Arjuna took an oath to kill Babruvahana or immolate himself if defeated. King Babhruvahana killed his father Arjuna with an arrow, a boon given to him by Ganga, Bhishma's mother. Repenting his deed after knowing Arjuna's identity, he was determined to kill himself, but he obtained from his stepmother, the Naga princess Uloopi, a gem called Nagamani which restored Arjuna to life with the help of Krishna. Arjuna becomes very happy to see her two wives together and later finds out Boy he fought is his own Son. He happily takes his both wives and Sons to Hastinapur. 

##Vibhishana of Mahabharat. 

Anyone who watched Ramayan series or even some Cartoon knows Vibhishana was Brother of Ravana. In all of Ravana ministers and Advisors, only Vibhishana tried to convince Ravana to Return Sita to Ravana as It will lead to Destruction of Lanka and took Rama Side in Battle and Played major Role in Rama Victory. 

Yuyutsu played much Similar Role in Mahabharat. As people knows Vikarna tried to Stop Draupadi Humilation. Yuyutsu also tried to Stop Draupadi Humilation by Saying It will lead to Destruction of Kuru Clan. He switched to Pandav Side in Epic Battle. He was one of Pandav Maharathi who Arjun claimed his Equivalent. 

##Dratrashtra doesn't Have Total 100 Sons. 

People very much Knows Dhratrashtra have 100 Sons From Gandhari, but not everyone atleast who only watch TV Series doesn't knows Dhratrashtra have another son Gandhari Maid Sauvali when Gandhari was having Infertility. 

##Druyodhana and Sushashan was not their real Name. 

Duryodhana Real Name was Suyodhana and Dushashana real name was Sushashan. Bheem during their childhood was used to moking Suyodhan by telling him duryodhana and our some historians give them that name. 

##Drona didn't refused to teach Karna Archery. 

Many People claims Drona refused to teach Karna Archery because he is Sutputra. But according to KMC and Bori versions, Drona actually teach him Archery and Karna was his student among with Pandav and Kauravs. 

In Jelousy and competitiveness, Karna Demands drona to teach him Bhramastra to defeat Arjun which Drona refuse. Then Karna leaves and goes to Parsurama just to Learn Bhramastra.

Ahmedabad is among the seven cities that have recorded “high case load”, a term used by Niti Aayog CEO to suggest the city had been seeing high number of cases compared to others.

Undeniably, the Tablighi Jamat event in March, 2020 at Delhi was profoundly influential in the spread of the virus.

Our Government, our media & a large population of our society blamed the organizers & the participants - and rightly so.

Sadly, it spilled over beyond boundaries of decency & civility. People were hounded, treated inhumanely & vilified beyond all rationale.

Acts of defiance, non co-operation, violence by the very people that authorities genuinely wanted to help compounded matters.

While a large extent of that spread & the infection has been identified & controlled, it's true spread may never be fully known.

Nation-wide lockdowns were enforced since March 22nd with the express intent to contain & suppress the spread in our densely populated land. 

While implementation & execution of the lockdowns may leave a lot to be desired - it's deployment was undeniably a great idea. 

Had the people adhered to it & had the state & central government planned it ever so slightly better - it would helped save a lot more lives & substantially curb the spread of the infection.

But almost 50 days since the declaration of the lockdown - the situation across the country shows no concrete signs of improvement.

A point that is also highly essential is that testing during the early stages of the lockdown was very, very low - and the relatively high volume of it now is clearly highlighting the massive extent of the spread.

On the other hand, antibody tests aren't even being deployed at a large scale in our country - so identifying patterns, creating better containment strategies & [potentially using plasma therapy from survivors](https://www.indiatoday.in/newsmo/video/coronavirus-survivor-donates-plasma-for-treatment-1672636-2020-04-29) are not even feasible for exploration at the moment.

Which makes the relative lack of focus on the ""Namaste Trump"" Gujarat event an even bigger cause of concern. 

[Given the fact that earliest infection in America is widely considered to be in ***Washington*** in January 2020 - and assuming fairly that a huge part of Trump's entourage are indeed from the very same area.](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0121-novel-coronavirus-travel-case.html)

With many states rumoured to be suppressing the full extent of their infections Goa, Bengal, Maharashtra, etc.) - could that be the case for Gujarat as well?

But people are donating for only one group and the campaign is being run by the violent terrorist who should be in jail. He is the scumbag who unleashed the mobs and now he has become the superstar. 

People are just lying and creating 100% fake news about how Muslim victim groups are getting money from ""Khan Market"" or whatever nonsense and so they will not give a single rupee to the Muslim victims of Kapil Mishra's Sanghi death squads. 

For example here. These two justifications for this are popular but based on complete lies. Of course Hindu Nationalists have no problem with lies.

This is so enraging. The worst thing is complete lies they are making up that the Muslim victims don't need help because they will be taken of by the ""secular"" or whatever when this is not happening at all. And the man who started the riots directly has faced no consequences and is being treated as a savour. 

Imagine in America if someone was to crowdfund for ""white victims only"" in a riot where mostly black people died. 

The right wing in India is so much more openly monstrous and blood thirsty.

When this new development came to life. Silence. Not a single of those girls came forward for any discussion. My friend's fb post has been up for a few hours now and not a single woman has commented. 

There is no black and white here. The Locker Room group exists and yes all that shit happens. But those screenshots, the ones which caused the most uproar are fake. Such fake incidents eventually end up harming women too. And I am not dictating what should someone post or not. It their life. But it just makes me wonder where are these women now?

So there was an Indian 'girl' who added me on snapchat. Apparently she was married but like to talk to random guys. There's nothing wrong with this but she never verified that she's the same girl she claims to be. She never sent a snap (live photo). She always sent saved photos. When I called her out, she confessed she indeed was guy. The guy was sharing photos of his crush ( his good friend) and claiming to be her. When asked if she knows about this he answered in negative. I him to apologise to her and redeem himself but he immediately deactivated the account.

I have screenshots of chats and the photos that he shared. I have been trying to reverse search the images so that I find the girl and alert her. Reverse image search on Google and tineye hasn't helped.

So I thought of reaching out to the Reddit community. Does anyone know how I can find out who she is? He has tonnes of images of her. I'm not sure how got them but he has been misusing them.

Note: This post is for discussion. If you have nothing but belligerent responses that add nothing to the conversation I will report you. If you only have worn out, down over a thousand times arguments of being caste blind, having merit and anti reservation nonsense, I will be ignoring you. 

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, lets talk.

The anti muslim sentiment grows stronger even in lockdown, with the hindu right finding more ways to demonize muslims everyday. I didnt think it could be possible, but every day it seems they have a new angle of attack. 

And such it has been since day 1 i.e. the day the 2014 elections results came out when the muslim techie was murdered by a hindu mob and that mosque attack happened, I'm forgetting where. The very day of the results. Modi hadnt even taken up PMship that day. 

So to begin, Anti-Muslim rhetoric creates a unified Hindu identity. This is something that BJP has long worked for and was one of the goals of VHP, HM and RSS since their inception - create a Hindu identity that trumps caste indentity so that the caste status quo is maintained while killing any caste discourse. 

Now, I'm muslim. And I have no intention of blaming Dalits for the victory of BJP. Dalits, much like Muslims, have been promised much by politicians purporting to be their champions but delivery has been less than spectacular. Lalu's first term & Maywati's first full term withstanding, no government has been able to delivery upon their promises to their dalit and obc voter very much. So yes, I do not blame these communities for voting outside their 'champions', for 'fracturing' the community vote. 

But the fact remains that Modi's government has done spectacular work for the backward communities (barring muslims). We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal. From being called ""Congress + Cow"" it has been jokingly called ""Prakash Karat + Cow"". Such is the success of Modi's socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth.

But coming to the matter at hand, OBC representation in Parliament has been dropping and sarvana i.e. upper caste repesentation is increasing. Now, Dalits have reserved seats so while their count can not decrease, but this seat reservation is working against them. I'm going to copy paste directly from an article here to explain this

[Not a single constituency in India has more than 50 per cent Dalit population, which means it’s always the non-Dalits who decide the fate of Dalit candidates in reserved constituencies. A vocal or assertive Dalit leader has the least chance of winning from such seats. To be re-elected, a Dalit MP must be careful not to antagonise the non-Dalits, and one way of ensuring this is by remaining silent in Parliament.](https://theprint.in/opinion/17th-lok-sabha-looks-set-to-confirm-ambedkars-fears-no-vocal-dalits-in-parliament/232383/)

Note that Balasaheb knew this would happen. Which is why he proposed that non dalits not be given a vote on reserved seats. I am very much with him on this.

So who is the loser here? Mayawati has lost her base. There can be no doubt about it. The BSP+SP combine failed because SP votes were transfered to BSP but the BSP vote was not. Why? Because Dalits find BJP a more attractive proposition than BSP.  Who else? Lalu and Mulayam have lost a significant base altho this could be attributed to multiple reasons. It is also less significant because OBC leaders are many. Dalit leaders are few. 

While Chandrashekar 'Raavan' Azad has made a great big splash, he is being kept under hold by the government almost since day 1. He has the appeal to be a mass leader and present a large potential threat to the status quo. But he has been muzzled and jailed as often as was possible. 

Ultimately even the news cycles focus on muslim, and the caste conflicts happeneing everyday take a backseat, all the while forgetting that 85% of Indian Muslims are lower caste muslims. Here too, the muslim identity has trumped the caste identity and they are doubly the losers here considering that most muslim victim to Islamaphobic attack tend to be the under privileged and of backward caste.

This is all by design, mind you. The idea here is the same I mentioned earlier. Maintain caste status quo and the cost of caste identity. And its working.

Note that Modi himself never speaks about caste. Despite being an OBC he never mentions caste struggles and his own caste related experiences. So his being OBC does not bring more visibility to the problems of the oppressed castes.

It is not meant to stir up or denigrate anyone, but to rationally put forth a point that has been consuming me for a long time. Please don't read this from the viewpoint of Churchill's regard of India as a geographical origin than a single country, or the pre-independence abhorrence of colonial India as an operational nightmare.

First of all, let me elucidate my viewpoint: India as a country operates as a federation of states under part 11 of the constitution, which means that the center can singularly exert control over all the states and the 1.3 billion people in the country by passing legislation that particular states may not democratically agree to. Despite having hundreds of actively spoken languages and newspapers, diverse literature, movies, Indic and Abrahamic religions, as well as vast differences (statewide) in the parameters of HDI growth, we still function centrally under a single constitution that provides us fundamental rights to live. But this very fact that we do hold in high regard as testification to the expression championed over the years, ""Unity in Diversity"", is impudent to the colossally different people of India who have to bend to the will of a raucous majority.

Where do we start? The Devendra people burnt 2800+ houses in response to the electoral victory of a Maravar candidate in the Tamil Nadu elections in the 1950s, around the same time where a civic protestor fasted unto death over the center's insistence to not officially recognize their language. Hindu-Muslim riots became the talk of the town of a post-Nehru India, marketed as poster-child rhetoric of politics. That the masses are so gullible and ignorant as to even heed the politicians insinuates that we may not become a developed country for a lifetime or two. Places like Maharashtra where reservation is aptly justified owing to the pains and struggles of the labor class dictates policy nationwide, which has also often led to riots and wanton murders. The cow belt is the shady authority on Hinduism, softly dictating the rest of India on the boundaries of what all can be accepted. To be scared to not stand up to the anthem is a fear inculcated by a political few. It may not be dense of me to even bring up the racism faced by the people of the northeast. While UP may curb down the LGBTQ+ movement, places like Punjab, Maharashtra, and Kerala may have no problems to celebrate this and even integrate it to the highest degree into their respective states. A place like Goa may permit Marijuana consumption and allow safe red-light districts and adult clubs to flourish, while it may be unthinkable to even start regulating the post-midnight sex streets of Delhi and Mumbai. The Shiv Sena in Maharashtra will not be even obligated to float Hinduism Orwellian ideas if it were not connected to the Center parliamentary politics. And even when it may be legally possible to condone such ideas, the vast population and the thirst for having an influence on the center make it highly difficult to do so.

The problems of India are not confined to the contention of having a Hindu majority and a Muslim minority, but the divergence of seemingly progressive and repressive ideas. The talks of Mumbai having a religious diversity ring hollow in light of the rampant residential segregation. The fact it was 'halwa' to target the Hindu community while plotting the post-Babri Bombay riots indicates the level of separation. Not only does every state has a different view on landmark decisions, but the level of differences that exist in society make it impossible to truly have a free market. And all of this would be okay in any other country, but here in India, an uneducated people's majority that is vulnerable to getting swayed by politics has given the country the 'good ol India' image to the West. How is it acceptable to justify a religiously-motivated crime with another crime in the past (for example equating cow lynching victims with Kashmiri pandit cleansing)? 'Badla politics' is beyond my horizons of understanding. I'll even concede that Nehru desperately tried to unite us, but in his discovery of India, he failed to notice the very yardstick of nationalism for Indians. Our idea of being an Indian is to own land and support family and if given the opportunity, migrate to another developed country. Chest thumping religious fervor quells criticism more than politics. Where is freedom of speech? Where is the freedom of the press, and where is the freedom from religion? Our own equivalent of the first amendment lurks in the gutters of society, used only as a matter of a written rule in the constitution. We are a flailing state and only require a tinge of politics to butcher ourselves now and then. Now that I have explained the problem at large of India being dangerously heterogenous, let me finally present my opinion.

I believe strongly that we can find immense prosperity if India functioned as a district of states than an official country, or a union of countries with a single free market. Far-right Hindus can exploit UP and Bihar as much as they like without snowballing damages to other parts and progressive states such as Maharashtra, Punjab, and Kerala can freely pursue reforms that they would have found otherwise impossible to do so earlier. All districts or countries would agree to a charter allowing free movement of goods and people. A single army can be used and the Kashmir problem can become the problem of the District/Union of India. A single GDP can be used as well as borrowing and lending abilities, remaining unaltered. The only difference would be curbing nationalism and allaying federalism. Legislative and judiciary branches will no longer be the same. Freedom of speech will be absolute in certain areas while restrictive in some. Some would thrive off of immigrants, while some would abhor them. Individual states may develop their own national identity and should they feel obliged to protecting their people from other states, they may do so. In a way, it will truly be like a cultural union of countries that make up India.

The reason this may work is threefold. First, an extreme degree of autonomy will be granted to individual states and the freedom to express oneself more will bring about individual independence than national independence. Second, we will finally acknowledge the hatred that subsumes us and remarkably reduce the religious segregation so prevalent in the country. Third, without the need for cozying up to a particular majority to earn brownie points for the center, the states that are repressive today will themself improve when they compare themselves to the progressive ones. All we need is a carefully drafted plan that encourages intellectual thought and scholarly discourse.

Finally, I just want to say that the truth is that India is not a geopolitical prisoner whose two hands carry the weight of corruption and communalism, but rather a beacon of majoritarian will. It is not as much a democracy, as it is a hypocrisy. So, when we pursue independent thought we tend to not realize how biased we have become only as a matter of existence. I rest my case and I'd like your opinion on how otherwise we can reach high socio-economic development standards in a single lifetime.",2020.0,5.0,31.0,17:48:30,victim,21

But we are sometimes able to afford a little bit of luxury ( which include an AC, living in apartments 1BHK which we bought with our live (10-15 yrs) savings) . We always go mall to travel but not to buy as we don't belong to that strata . Me and my cousins study at convent school, we are only able to pay its fee because we got into it through EWS quota so we were required to pay 1/4th of what other students pay (9000 rupees per quarter) . Our families do not work in an organized sector ( my father and my bua's husband (fufa) are priest ). Pay ranges from 500-1000 rupees a day and on good days it can be 1500 but these are very rare occasions ( Diwali pujan , Savitri Vrat and few more religious occasions ) there are bad months too where it can be less than 20000 rupees a month and good months  (35000 a month ) ie. no fixed income .

Now the main part : My aunt used to lend money  (with her savings of numerous year ) in hopes of earning some money and i agree their family had been luckier than mine. An acquaintance ( a woman in our locality ) we know because we all belong to same state ( odisha) and we all came to New Delhi for better oppurtunities. This woman approached my bua 2 years ago and told my bua that she will bring the  lendees but she will take an fraction of the interest that lendee paid and acted like a mediator ( If interest rate is 7% she will take 3%  and my bua 4%) . This woman acted all sweet , caring and generous in the start , she brought the lendees and my bua lent money to them , my bua started to reap the benefits which sowed with her money. 4000 rupees extra for a month for our class is a dream come true ( that meant we could buy new clothes , go to McDonald's with our family and other basic things which are luxury according to us) . This women ( acquaintance ) was much much richer than both of our families combined. My bua's downfall came with her greed.

I dont know why rich people, bureaucrats and politicians  show us dreams and give us hope but only to crush us totally . You think politician are greedy no they aren't greedy like people of our class who can sell kidneys but will not sell their self esteem to beg money and votes like politician . This women showed my bua dreams  only to crush them fully. My Ma warned my bua (as my ma and bua are good friends ). This women won my bua's trust, no matter how much my ma warned her she didn't listen,  she seemed as if she was hypnotized by that woman . My bua did everything that woman told. Last summer (july) that woman approached my bua with a new case, she said there is this person who needs 18 lacs for an surgery (this person was going to pay 8% interest at end of 6 months with the principal amount ) and my bua even trusted her , worst part is my bua never met this person who needed the money . My bua took out all her savings of 10 years and gave it to her that without any proof , my bua was so gullibe she didn't even took any collateral . We didn't knew any of this sort happening until today . My bua called my ma today and asked ma to come to her home where she informed her the problem apparently she hadn't even eaten anything in last 2 days maybe because of the anxiety attacks and high stress she maybe going through .

My bua further told my ma , that the person was supposed was supposed to pay in month of January 2020 but the person has not given anything till now (23 May 2020 ). Apparently that women told my bua that when she was bringing back the money from lendee's house , few people kidnapped her and but she offered money in exchange of her life and they left her alone somewhere in south delhi and to make things further unsensible, this all happened 3 days , and that women informed my bua day before yesterday. The woman's her husband is saying something like "" Please leave us alone we are very troubled , give us time for  us get into proper state of mind. My wife got kidnapped and you are asking for money  !! What about humanity ? Aren't you people pujari and bramhin you are supposed to be virtuous and selfless . "" and other bullshit and the woman is acting like third grade Simar ( Sasural simar ka ) crying without any tears, crying while scream, fake anxiety attacks , throwing her steel plates while leaving china ones unharmed and  the part where they act like victims is fucking annoying. When the woman was asked if she filled any FIR she said she didn't and when asked her statement in writing with a finger print as a verification she is said she cant because according to her  "" hum court kachehri ke chakkar mai nahi padna chahte ""  as they cant afford court  fees ( her husband earns 1 lac per month , they own two cars, they have big house in Bhubhneshwar) . We  even found out today that woman had taken money from other people too .

Biggest problem, we can't even file a FIR  because we are the police will most probably trust their side of story . We do not have any proof up until now. Feeling helpless for my bua right now. I hope she had eaten something till now. They have no savings left at all to deal with this crisis. Thing is people respect us and we have dignity ( caste system ) but we don't have that much money to act dignifiedly . I wish my papa and fufa could act less dignifiedly and fight for their rights,  but i know they won't . And thing which worsens the situation is a belief  "" People from general caste cant be oppressed "" . Power corrupts people not religion, caste or other bullshit . Being a hindu or muslim doesn't make corrupt. Being a hindu or muslim does not make you spread hate. Society is a machine and we are like a nut , if we dont fit we get replaced .

Thats what most Indians percieve a mental disorder to be. They dont realize that there are mild disorders causing stress and anxiety. A person saying he has a bone fracture or some physical disorder does not carry any social harm with him. But a mental victim is percieved to be.

So my advice to those with mental disorders is to act as normal as you can in front of people. You are doing the right thing by hiding your disorder.

 PLEASE DO NOT BE HONEST WITH EVERY TOM, DICK AND HARRY IN THIS COUNTRY. Dont be honest about your disorder even with those who look compassionate as compassion can be faked. Be honest only with the guy who can give you medical support (doctor) and the guy who can give you financial support (your father)

 If you are jobless because of it and nosey people ask you what do you do, tell them [""I love dance/music/football"".](https://www.theminimalists.com/do/) Tell them your passion and brush these useless and selfish burdens of society away from you. You dont need them. I call them burdens because most of them ask these questions for their own greed , contacts and ego, not to help others.

  This is not about the sorry exodus of millions of our more unfortunate brothers and sisters playing out on prime TV these days. It is not a piece about the government, or about politics or economics. It is neither critical nor sacerdotal. It is not about Mr. Modi or the Biblical scale suffering he has inflicted, yet again, on those who had put their trust in him. That is a matter between him and his Maker, and I hope the potter who moulded him can forgive him, for history will not. This is not about a callous Finance Minister with the rictus of arrogance stretched across her face. It is not about a judiciary which has thrown away its moral compass in the arid deserts of ambition and preference. It is not about a media which has struck a Faustian bargain with the devil and is content to feed on the offal flung its way. It is not about Rahul Gandhi or Mayawati or Nitish Kumar for they have already become irrelevant to the pathetic course of events unfolding.
  This piece is about me and the burden I carry, a burden of shame, that has been sitting on my back for the last few weeks and cannot be dislodged, no matter how hard I try. It' s a burden which just got heavier this morning when I read a post by an army officer describing his moving encounter in Gurgaon with families of ""migrants"" walking their way to Bihar, no footwear on the weary soles treading on melting roads, hungry and uncomprehending four year olds, of how they wept and tried to touch his feet when he gave them a few five hundred rupee notes.
  I hang my head in shame in the India of 2020. At belonging to a country and a society which exiles tens of millions from their cities, fearful of catching an infection from them, from a virus brought here, not by them, but by my brethren flying in from abroad. Of treating the hapless victim as the perpetrator. Ashamed of being a gullible cretin who swallows all the lies and half-truths churned out by a dissembling official apparatus. Of beating pots and pans as a servile hosanna to an uncaring presiding deity to drown out the sounds of tired feet marching to their distant villages.
  I can no longer recognise the religion I was born into, it no longer has the wisdom of its ancient sages and rishis, or the compassion of an Ashoka, or the humility of a Gandhi. It is too full of anger, of hatred, of violence. It has replaced its once lofty ideals with even loftier statues, caring deeds with dead rituals. It once fed the mendicant and the poor but now drives them away as carriers of some dreadful disease, without any proof. It even finds an opportunity in this pandemic to stigmatize other religions.
  I am ashamed of my middle class status, of many of my friends, colleagues and the larger family even. Cocooned safely in our gated societies and sectors, we have locked out our maids, drivers, newspaper man, delivery boy and a dozen others who have built for us the comfortable lives we now desperately try to cordon off from the less fortunate. We have deprived them of their livelihoods. We encourage another extension of the lockdown because our salaries and pensions are not affected. Our primary concerns revolve around resumption of deliveries from Amazon and Swiggy: the lot of the migrating millions is dismissed as just their fate- the final subterfuge of a society that no longer cares.

   I am ashamed of the thought processes of my class, of Whatsapp forwards that oppose any more ""doles"" to the hungry millions, that denounce MNREGA- the only lifeline the returning labour have left- as a waste of public money and food camps as a misuse of their taxes. I am ashamed that people like me can encourage the police to beat up the returning hordes for violating the lockdown, which, in the ultimate analysis was meant to protect ""us"" from ""them"". For the life of me I am unable to comprehend how we, sitting in our four BHK flats, have the heartlessness to blame sixteen tired labourers for their own deaths: why were they sleeping on railway tracks? How can one not be ashamed when I hear my peers decrying the expense of trains/ buses for the returning migrants, the costs of putting them up in quarantine, when they approve of their likes being flown back by Air India ? This is not double standards, this is bankrupt standards.
  I am ashamed of my social milieu which lauds the leader for dismissing the cataclysmic sufferings of almost five percent of our population as ""tapasya"", as if they had a choice. I am mortified to see the layers of education and affluence, the facade of civilisation being peeled back by a virus to disclose a heart of darkness in our collective inner core, the sub cutaneous mucous of hatred and intolerance for a minority community, contempt for the destitute. All age old prejudices, bigotry, racism and narrow mindedness have reemerged, fanned by a party which has fertilised their dormant spores.
  I am ashamed of the dozens of four star Generals and beribboned Admirals and Air Chiefs who  were quick to shower flowers and light up ships at a dog whistle from a politician but did not move a finger to provide any help to the marching millions. Did it even occur to them that they owe a duty to this country beyond strutting around at India Gate? That they could have used their vast resources and vaunted training to set up field kitchens for the hungry marchers, putting up tents where the old and infirm could catch a few breaths, arrange transport for ferrying at least the women and children?Their valour has been tested at the borders, but their conscience has certainly been found wanting.
  I am ashamed of our judges who have now become prisoners in their carefully crafted ivory towers, who had repeated opportunities to order the executive to provide meaningful relief and succour to the exiled wretches, to enforce what little rights they still have left, but spurned them at the altar of convenience.
  I am ashamed of our governments who have forsaken the very people who elected them, and are using their vast powers, not to provide the much needed humanitarian aid these disorganised workers desperately need, but to take away even the few rights they had won over the last fifty years. I am ashamed of a bureaucracy that uses a catastrophe to further enslave those who have already lost everything, which insists that illiterate labourers fill in online forms to register for evacuation, pay hundreds of rupees ( which they do not have) for rail tickets, produce ration cards and Aadhar before they can get five kgs of rice, all the while beating them to pulp. Of a Joint Secretary to government who can apportion blame for the infections by religion. This is not Orwellian or Kafkaesqe, this is a government gone berserk. How can one not be ashamed of such a soul-less administration, and of the people who commend its mistakes?

   They will reach their homes ultimately, those marching millions, minus a few thousand who will die on the way. They will not even be mentioned in the statistics: there will be no Schindler's list for them. And we will pat ourselves on our collective, genuflecting backs that one problem has been taken care of, the danger to our neo-liberal civilisation has been beaten back, the carriers have been sent away, the curve will now flatten. But the mirror has cracked and can never be made whole again. As the Bard said, the fault is not in our stars but within us. Or, as  delectably put by another great bard, one of our own who now belongs to the ""others"":

             "" Umar bhar Ghalib yahi bhool karta raha,
               Dhool chehre par thi, aur aina saaf karta raha.""

  Actually, this piece is not just about me- it's also about you, dear reader. Look into that cracked mirror. Do you feel any shame, just a little , for what we have become, for the lost soul of a once great nation?

Unfortunately for KumariNayak, a 63-year-old woman from the Ganjan district of Odisha, her life has been a humiliation because she has Polydactylism.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/se8pqngcm0n41.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a05d1d9821b72ee428b88ec5d46e8bd0b2a717b

Polydactylism is a defect in the body where the person suffers from abnormal growth. In the case of Kumari, she was born with 19 toes and 12 fingers by birth. Her life was made miserable by this disease as, since childhood, people used to keep their children away from her and call her names. 

Kumari said in an interview: ‘I was born with this defect and I couldn’t be treated as we belonged to a low-income family. ‘

As she grew old, things turned even worse as she was called a witch by her neighbors. She feels terrible by such remarks but is helpless as she cannot get herself treated and can’t fight a long battle with superstitions. Therefore, she keeps herself indoor to avoid bitter words.

It has now been 63 years that I have had this condition. She said in the interview, ‘The residents nearby, who are too much into blind faiths, believe that I am a witch and keep away from me. They sometimes come to see my condition – but never help. ‘I am forced to stay indoors as I am being treated differently, which is not a nice way of treatment from my neighbors.’

One of her neighbors, who understands the medical condition of Kumari, often comes to help her, but even she said that the mentality of people in a small village is such that they think of everything in terms of good or bad, god-like or witch. And, Kumari’s medical condition has made her the witch of the village.

On hearing Kumari’s situation, government officials of India have decided to come to her aid. She is granted a house and monthly pension so that she can live a life of dignity. Even measures are taken to stop murders of women in the pretext of witch-hunting and black magic.

In 2016, there were 135 cases registered of murder and lynch mobbing to curb black magic. Even though the government of India is taking measures to curb such heinous acts, but the administration feels the efforts on the ground level are not adequate, and mass awareness needs to be spread about such diseases. 

Let's hope stricter laws are passes, and victims of such diseases are also considered humans and give their share of respect in society.

But I don't where we would go if we leave my father I earn barely anything. My little sister is still in school. I don't know what to do know . I has started to affect my mental health a lot now.

472,35,52,Harrassed by Sector 99 Mohali landlord's sister who wishes death to my family,20.0,fradwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fradwf/harrassed_by_sector_99_mohali_landlords_sister/,11.0,1585534572.0,"This goes back to november, but since the lady who rented out her brother's flat had harrassed me so much I am making a public account of it. She has threatened to fabricate stories, wished my parents were dead. She abused me for 2-3 weeks straight and I have decided not to stay quiet anymore as she is vindictive and I believe very jealous.

The  12 month lease was under my father's name as he was the sole tenant. Payable according to the rent were: monthly rent (13500 rupees), electricity and water. There was no mention of any maintenance. The  building was under Puma  realtors who absconded and the owners who took possession of the flats were tasked with maintaining it. Soon there were all kinds of meetings, elections amongst flat owners  to form a committee, and implement mini money making schemes amongst themselves.  For example, Puma realtors left an unpaid electricity bill of 13 lakhs, which gave impetus to side money making schemes in the guise of ""repayment""

My father paid half the year's maintenance unknowingly, as this woman(Amarjeet Raina Bujrall) would send a utility man to collect money each month (about 2500 rupees I believe).  My father thought he was paying tip/bakhshish to the garbage man, guards for their roti/paani.  Instead he paid half a year's maintenance in cash, unknowingly.

Rent was only late  1 month by 2 weeks, because I was traveling out of India and had to send someone physically to the bank, as the account only accepts direct deposits (NRO/NRI account).  The time the rent was late was also when there were floods in Punjab. Her

At some point this lady started pestering my father to vacate the flat as she wanted to take tuitions there. She began badgering him to leave 3 months before the end of the lease. He is a patient with a long lasting condition and her constant badgering was not good for his health.  She would repeatedly call him and talk about his mental state, pushing him. He called me up  more than once and I decided to move him immediately because at around the same time she started insinuating what would happen if he died. I packed and moved him and left the keys with the guard. The flat was fully cleaned and pictures and a video were taken .

I did not inform her, because of her toxic behavior and extremely abusive tone. Her husband and her are bankrupt I believe at this point.

The  rent, electricity and water were fully paid.  She bought up maintenance  and upon  re-reading the lease I let her no that maintenance was not part of the lease. She even wanted 5 rupees per transaction for the money that was deposited as rent! At this point she starts attacking me personally, wishes my family ill and goes to the police station and makes an inspector call. I told the inspector if she has a case, she should get a lawyer. Her vitriol on whatsapp at this point had been going on for 2- 3 weeks.

Couple of things:

1. She has repeatedly threatened me which leads me to believe she will try to sabotage my work/life by fabricating stories. She 'gaslights' and has zero qualms about lying
2. I am a Canadian. She has also threatened to sue me in Canada. I have informed the border control as nobody goes on a tourist visa with the intention of suing. Also I am not even on the lease.
3. Her brother or she has given NO receipts. I have bank deposit slips. Are they evading taxes?
4. I have messaged her on whatsapp of March and let her know that her abuse and threats will not remain in private anymore. Abusers get away with far too much in private. And she's somehow led herself to believe that she's ""morally right""
5. Her abuses are the typical jealous woman kind. They center around my work, how much money I make, my family's health, marital status etc.  She also takes special interest in belittling my elderly father.
6. She is not very intelligent and doesn't have the capacity to understand any reasoning. ABSOLUTELY DUMB. She is the one who made the lease in which no maintenance is mentioned. I tried to reason with her, but have of March let her know that her abuse/threats won't remain  private
7. Some of her abuses:

* Calling my father ""Gursikh Parkinson's"" (because of parkinson's disease),  being derogatory to my parents
* Calling me a bitch
* Calling us absconders, freeloaders
* Telling me she will go to any lengths to harm me
* Stating that the rising corona cases in USA  are high and implying that I should get corona (as I sometimes visit there)
* Her immediate neighbors have insinuated that she is abusive to her kids and other people's kids. So abuse is probably all that she knows.

She does NOT have the money for a lawyer. Going to the police is free. However, never underestimate jealousy and vindictiveness.

What are some other steps that I should take to protect myself? I have put up a public record of her behavior to safe guard myself since I do take threats seriously",2020.0,3.0,30.0,08:01:12,victim,12
473,36,55,Feeling suicidal: Narcissistic mother and my mental breakdown in these times of lockdown,39.0,fpsbs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fpsbs1/feeling_suicidal_narcissistic_mother_and_my/,10.0,1585320614.0,"This lockdown is a hell for me. My mother is very narcissistic in nature and my dad the very opposite. I am 24. I belong to a lower middle class family, my dad runs a paan shop and my mom works as a cook in different homes.

She always mistreats my dad due to his low income and his submissive nature. She is short tempered. She used to yell at me and my sister for not being extroverts and used to say things like ''why was I cursed with such kids'', ''I am the smartest in the whole extended family'', etc. She always saw me as a window to a good lifestyle once I start earning well in the future. 

My mother used to  bash me for not losing weight but when I finally lost weight she bashed me again for losing too much of weight and criticized my diet habits. As a kid, I was always verbally abused for smallest of the mistakes. Gradually, I developed a horrible personality wherein I didn't wanted to hurt people even by the slightest of my actions. I realised this only few years back. I still can't smile properly.

As I grew up things somehow felt better, she used to be angry less frequently atleast towards us kids. But I started losing the track on my studies. I went into depression, not studying, failing my professional exams, addicted to phone, etc. Once she got to know about this she cried and was empathetic for me. Obviously she isn't at all an evil person but her narcissistic side has done more harm than her good side. 

There was never an emotional connect in my family. I hide my emotions, never to be on my own while with my family. Once I even shifted to another city finding a job to live on my own, but this bloody depression made me abandon my job and again I came back to my family. Took a job again, but entry level jobs always felt a drag, so I left it to study for another professional exam. 

Now at this point, I knew it was risky to quit and live at home on my parents money. Yet I continued thinking my parents will support me. Things were going fine until this lockdown. My exams were postponed, my dad went to village, expenses now depending on our savings.

Today I was not in a great mood and made a small mistake of refusing to bring some snack items from the shop, my sister too refused as she was studying. And it was a tipping point, she got angry and started her harsh verbal bashing saying ""people are earning truckloads of money outside and you people are sitting at home eating on my money while throwing tantrums. You people have achieved so much by studying that you are still sitting at home. You don't deserve me"" ,etc etc. She was continuously abusing and I lost my control and cried. 

I felt suicidal, I am losing hopes of living a good life. I am highly myopic in one eye with -9.0 and -2.0 and at times I feel like my eyes are giving up. The only hope I have is to migrate again and this time I have a strong will to live independently but thinking about surviving this lockdown for so many days ahead is making me claustrophobic.",2020.0,3.0,27.0,20:35:14,victim,24
474,37,56,Need Advice : War of Independence against parents. Does it ever end ? How to make a peaceful settlement ?,51.0,fdsxrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fdsxrh/need_advice_war_of_independence_against_parents/,27.0,1583430110.0,"I am a 25 year old socially awkward man and I think my parents are to blame for it.
I am gonna tell my story and some of the elements may relate to you but don't try to forcefully relate to everything as our mind is quite easily fooled to do so. Also i'm not trying to generalize Indian parents or have any beef against them as i have no authority to judge any parent (as  I've not been one yet and know nothing about  raising a kid). I simply just want to tell you my story and want some advice from any older people (25+) here and also i would like the younger ppl here just to read rather than giving any advice or any conclusion.

Till 18 (before going to college)

From school time my parents have restricted me and my siblings to go out of the house for any kind of activity be it leisure or work. They've tried to do as much they can for us themselves. This was ok and acceptable when we were young but with time as we grew older we thought that we will be taught these things (the why we thought so was because almost every friend around us could do certain things (like going out to buy stuff or hanging out with friends or going out of the house after dark, etc.) without having to rely on their parents, which is a slow start to an eventual low self esteem). The really annoying part is when they start blaming you for not being able to do basic things on your own.
I've not been able to talk properly to any girl during my school time because of lack of social skills which is something i would also blame our school systems too (Can't say this for every school but i've been to a good school in my area and the generally it'll be considered a punishment to sit with someone of the opposite sex, god knows why). The thing i don't understand is why most ppl consider being around and being attractive to the opposite sex is a luxury and will call you a crybaby if this aspect of your life hurts you and ask you to man up and have the guts to go and talk, made it like a contest or a battle to overcome. I would be lying to you if i say i don't have any sexual urges and ""am strictly in for the friendship"" but it is something i can't avoid and when you've not talked to a member of the opposite sex  (other than members of your own family) and with all the cancerous sex culture around men and women being thrown on your face through advertisements and movies without  any proper control i find it really hard not to have those urges. And on top of that parents, who would ask me to think of every girl as my sister and try to keep distance and not talk more than is necessary, which is ok if it's just said 1 or 2 times but when it's incepted in your head during your early years of childhood why wouldn't it stay (also stuff like this hurts a person who overthinks (overthinking developed due to social awkwardness but transports to every aspect of life. a cancer indeed) because of the incest nature of talking to a non family member of the opposite sex)

But everything will be okay because you are about to go to college now, become independent and have fun for these 4 to 5 years of your life, right? Wrong. It's basically your indian bar mitzvah. For now you and you alone shall be blamed for your mistakes even though they might be happening due to a behavior and shortcomings you developed because of a bad upbringing and being forced to do something you never really wanted to do in the first place. So much for Independence.

18-22 (The good days of anyone's life) Pseudo Independence

Not gonna deny college was super fun but not because it added anything new to it but because i was able to see how good it feels to be physically alone for the first time and how important friends are. (Still no girlfriend though) College isn't really fun if you don't know what career you want to go for, because if after 4 years you don't have a job or haven't any idea for what kind of job you want you are just fucked. I tried a lot of things in college and succeeded in doing one but my parents weren't happy with it, so i had to drop it and do something which satisfied them and also aligned partially with my goals but they again declined it because all they want is one thing, a three letter job (needless to say more). Apart from this i really thought i'll get the long awaiting independence to go out of the house now that i'm a college student and a legal adult but hell no. In 8 holidays (4 winter and 4 summer) i haven't been allowed to go out of the house unless it was for intern or for some work just like it was in school. I have not been allowed to go meet a friend ever. Not that i don't have any money or my expenditure is quite high, it's just some orthodox thinking. It just sucks being trapped in 4 walls. The psyche stays when you move out too. I've had trouble taking initiatives to go out of my room because it has been so well inculcated in my head. I feel scared sometimes to go out alone and without permission. I was fortunate to have friends with whom i spent most of my time with. Plus weed helped with making more new friends. And fuck you anyone weed didn't make you any friends, it was yourself, it really wasn't. No one would even talk to me before i started smoking. It really helps you get into some circles quite easily unless you;ve this amazing personality which is not so easy to come by when you've an upbringing which is well fit to make you socially awkward. Also weed and alcohol relaxes you and opens you up to speak your mind (i wish i can do that sober but i simply can't thanks parents for this wonderful disadvantage). Talking about women, nothing here again simply because women have a lot of choices compared to men and why wouldn't a woman chose someone who is charming + nice as compared to just nice. Being nice is not going to take you anywhere, it's a competition really if the sex ratio is this fucked up. Why would any girl who is maintaining herself well go for someone who is nice but is socially awkward when there are 10+ others who are more than what you are. and before any girl says stop generalizing us, i'd like to point out it'd be the same with men had they been in minority. It's a simple numbers game nothing crazy here. The only blame i have is on parents for not allowing me to develop. But this creates another big question wouldn't there always be someone above or below you and wouldn't you always be below  someone which might lead you to never be happy? i guess i just want to find an environment where i'm a little better or be able to develop myself to enter environment higher is social hierarchy and dominance.

22-25 (The real Independence)

Now that i've got a job, life should be fine i guess. I'll go out and no one is going to bother me for at least a year. I'll make new friends maybe a girlfriend. I'll try to be sober and look after my health. I'll learn a new skill. I'll meet so many people. I'll earn and spend money on things that i'd have to take permission before. I'd not have to take permission for anything. I'd be free. 
If only that actually happened. 
Even after wasting 4 years i managed to get a job and even with all the mental health issues i had i was able to forget it all and start afresh. I was genuinely happy for the first time in my life. But i think my parents couldn't see that. They forced me to go for this biggest scam in our country : Govt. Job is Power and with this power you can be anything; which should actually have been Knowledge is Power but who has time for knowledge right, Knowledge is for losers. Only the knowledge that gives power and uppar ka paisa is useful. I believed them and again like a fool kept aside my needs to fulfill their dreams disguised to me as my dreams. I eventually failed four times (once in college at 22, then at 23,24 and now at 25) because i didn't want this. Not that the exam is difficult (it's really not) but i just can;t  get myself to sit and study with all the mental pressure and no one to listen. This is the first time i'm using internet to vent. Last i did was in college but the concerned people were so quick to call me as just stresses without even giving a thought to anything that might have caused it to be this way. I'm stuck now. I am looking for jobs now but I've no self confidence left in me. Literally nothing. I was really good at interviews and talking to people (because of college) but being in 4 walls rarely going out and not having a single ounce of pleasure for the last 3 years i'm just frustrated now. I tried strangling myself to death but the defense mechanism kicks in and always stops me because i know of stories and people in my life who are still surviving even after suffering 50x more than me. I'm just scared i don't live a few more years just to be more miserable and frustrated. i don't know if i'll be able to make friends now and being able to have any intimate relationship feels like a nightmare. i'm losing my health every day. I don't know if i'm depressed but the symptoms all check out so maybe. I can't go to a therapist because my parents wouldn't understand it and might think some kind of spirit has taken over me. i think i'll be able to get a job in a few days what i'm scared of is what happens afterwards. My insecurities will still be there. Insecurities which would've been eradicated had i gone for that job but might never go now. also it gives me this weird kind of pain in my stomach just thinking about going back to square one, looking for the job that i rejected, it just hurts.

P.S. sorry for the grammatical errors and typos. i'm literally crying typing this. sorry. thanks for hearing me out.
P.P.S. i'd like to clarify that my parents are not monsters, they love me and have never abused me physically but they are just naive when it comes to parenting and really put no thought sometimes in the things they are saying to their children and how their actions have affected us. They just think that the job of a parent is to earn for their kids and keep feeding them and eventually they will get a job and help them when they get old. that's it. all with the hope to keep their kids as close as possible. But still their is a lot of good in them although they are so troubled themselves because of childhood trauma it leaves everyone in this situation where everyone is just so helpless. It's really messed up.",2020.0,3.0,5.0,23:26:50,victim,25
475,38,62,Relationship advice,11.0,fe7y8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fe7y8m/relationship_advice/,13.0,1583496625.0,"Hello all!

I know this is not the best place to ask for relationship advice,but I decided to post this here since most of you are desis and will probably understand my circumstances better than anyone else:)

So I(F21)moved to the states from Pakistan around 10 years ago.MY boyfriend,who’s 29,moved here from india in 2017 for education,and then found work.We met on an south asian dating/marriage site around 2 years ago.I was brought in a religious,strict muslim household,and my parents would’ve never let me date before marriage,let alone date someone who is nonmuslim(boyfriend is hindu).

So when my parents found out 7 months into the relationship through our texts that I’d been dating someone,they were furious to say the least. Dad called him up and cursed at him,and let only let me go out of the house for classes.I decided it was time to break up,since we were still in the “getting to know eachother” phase.I found out he texted a friend of mine to ask her to make sure I’m okay and kept calling me.I had my phone taken away too.When I met up with him a week later,he told me he is serious about me and wants to get married.He said his parents are visiting in afew months and he would like me to meet them.I kept asking my parents to meet him once,but they outright refused.My parents have been incredibly caring,loving and friendly towards me and my sister.I think they were freaked out because I was 19 at the time,and was claiming to be in love with someone who’s hindu.

So we decided to continue dating without my parent’s knowledge.We really feel in love and everything was going well until my mom saw him on my college campus,and figured we were still dating.This time there was more physical abuse and I stayed with my best friend for a day.Dad finally said yes to meeting him in November of 2019 after I insisted I won’t break up with him unless dad met him.I wasn’t allowed to contact my bf until then(parents took away my phone and laptop).So when he texted my boyfriend from my phone and asked him to meet in a public place 2 days later,bf agreed.Dad brought me along too,and once we got there,he asked me to text him to find out if he’s here yet.He replied that he is here,but needs to here my voice first to make sure I’m okay.My dad refused,and told me this shows how much he loves me.He said if he really wanted to marry me,he would’ve come to speak to my dad instead of trying to find out if I had come along too.

I finally spoke to him and he came and met my dad,who was obviously extremely upset.He told my boyfriend he wants to maary me for citizenship,and that if he wants to marry me,he’d have to 1)get circumcised 2)transfer $30,000 to my bank account or pay me college tuition fees 3)send my dad a picture of his mom’s and dad’s visa to make sure they’re really visiting in a few months and 4)give my dad his SSN so he could do a background check on him.Boyfriend gave the ssn and his parent’s visas pictures right away,and agreed to transfer the money but refused the circumcision part.So dad brings me home and tells me this can’t work out since he outright refused to convert or get the circumcision done.Mom and dad tell me they would let me go if I really want to be with this guy,heck they’d even give me all of my documents,but that he’s going to divorce me as soon as he gets his citizenship through me.I stopped all contact with bf for a week,when he finally found me on linkedin and asked me to see him one last time.I did,and he said he just wants me to wait until his parents arrive in February of 2019.In the meantime,since I wasn’t allowed to go anywhere else other than college,he kept visiting me from time to time on my college campus during his work breaks for lunch.I finally met his mom in February.She got me a couple of presents but asked me to think seriously about my decisions.She said she doesn’t want her son to convert,and that she doesn’t suggest I leave my family,because you need family at all stages of life.After she left,bf assured me everything would be okay,and that we’ll convince my dad once I’ve completed my bachelors.

So we continued hanging out.We had little arguments here and there due to differences in cultures(him hanging out with a female friend late at night and clubbing) but I stayed because he said he would stop it all for me.We grew closer than ever.Parents had an inkling I was still seeing him and kept accusing me,but didn’t really have proof.I was having a really hard time living a double life,since I love my family so much but I love him so much too.His brother got married and I spoke to his sister in law.He asked me when I’ll be ready for marriage and I asked him to wait until I’ve graduated(I plan on pursuing medical school after graduation).

I didn't have a phone this whole time,ever since my parents took it away an year ago.I wasn't allowed to go to any events at all even at school,wear no makeup unless I'm with parents,they had all my email password,I couldn't have fb or instagram,etc.So exactly 3 days ago,my dad found an email I'd sent to my bf(I forgot to delete it!).He asked me who this guy is,and I was so scared I told him it's someone else.He pulled me by my hair and my mom and sister stood there watching.He  took away my school ID and driver's license.He messaged my boyfriend from my email to meet me on campus.He came,dad saw him and recognized him right away,he told my bf to wait for the result of his actions and walked back to our car.I kept crying asking my dad to give him a chance.Then bf stopped my dad and asked him to talk to him for 2 minutes.

I insisted too,and dad finally agreed.Dad insulted him for playing with me and using me for time pass.Bf said if he was passing his time with me,he wouldn't have fought so hard.He said his parents aren't exactly thrilled either,but he has persuaded them to accept this relationship.He also said that there're other girls too out there,but he wants to be with me.Dad asked him if he agrees to convert and change his religion on all his documents and bf said a week ""yes"".Then dad asked him to get circumcised,which is when bf refused.I told my dad right then and then that I love and respect him(my dad) which is why I am sitting right next to him,but that what he's asking my bf for is [unreasonable.Bf](https://unreasonable.Bf) started crying and asked dad to give him 2 months,since he'll me moving to another city for work pretty soon.Dad said if he loved me,he'd do anything for me.He then told my bf he'd think about it and we came home.

He told mom it's the same guy I was dating 2 years ago.They both came to my room while I was asleep and were very serious.They told me I won't get into medical school if I don't focus on my goals right now(my MCAT is coming up in a month) and that he's just using me for a green card.Dad said men who respect you don't ask for physical intimacy before marriage,and that if I ever choose him over my family they'll break all ties with me.He said he'll allow me to go to school but mom will be with me for the entire day.I'll go to class,and come sit with her in the car until it's time for my next class.This is how things have been ever since tuesday of this week.The very next day,my bf had a flight to san francisco for work.I somehow managed to message him and asked if he's in SF to which he replied ""Hi.Yes,but we can chat right now.Let me know when you come online"".I told him I'll talk to him when he's back(he's arriving back in town tonight).

What do I make of this?He knew my parents hit me so hard the last time they found out about us dating.Honestly,if I was in his place,I would've cancelled any flights/trips I had to make sure he's okay.Does it honestly sound to you like he's genuinely serious about me?Do I listen to my dad,or do I stay with my guy?",2020.0,3.0,6.0,17:55:25,victim,10

Encourage people to leave religion. Ban preaching of any religion to people under the age of 18. Slowly convert all places of worship into schools and hospitals. Anyone who claims to be a messenger of God and know about the afterlife is a fraud. Anyone who preaches to young children is a child abuser. Plain and simple.

2. Remove paid maternity leave. Why should an employer pay for your life choices? If I want to travel the world, should my employer be expected to pay me for 6 months while I'm on holiday. Just like travelling is an experience I'm choosing, having kids is also an experience people are choosing. 

Why does society owe them anything? Also, they demand a lot of tax credits and welfare benefits for producing more babies in this already overpopulated country(India) which is just ridiculous. Why should you reward someone for adding to the burden of this planet?

3. Mandatory vasectomy after having 2 kids. Adoption is always an option for those who want more.

4. Implement a high inheritance tax. The best way to bring economic equality is to give everyone a fair start. No one should have billions just for being born in the right family while other babies struggle to get even 2 meals a day.",2020.0,3.0,21.0,22:43:06,victim,18

I would like to set up a non-profit - a volunteer-based, worldwide network to intervene in situations of violence in families and the community, while keeping a proactive eye on people for prevention of the same. Volunteers will be trained and supervised by a strong group of professional mental health providers, and work from the same platform, taking peer support where necessary. 'Situations of violence' include all forms of violence and abuse - whether by threatening/hitting/drinking/taking drugs, or other problems caused within families.

The case is that most of the world's children cannot get help with these situations. 'Child Protective Services' or its equivalent may seem to be the first stop for these cases, but cultural situations are different worldwide, and not all children can just go and ask for help as easily as that, and hope to receive it. Besides this, there is a noticeable trend of people being lonely and otherwise depressed/miserable in the world, for which a sustained and supportive community will be of great help.

In order to get this idea working, first of all, I need people by me who are willing to make it work. I am currently working on a draft for the non-profit - aims, current situation, and overall strategy will be covered in the final plan. As of now, people can express willingness to join in, offer suggestions, and begin work towards finding others to join in. I am also thinking of making a subreddit geared towards this topic.

Thank you for being here - and know that it is you, people like you, and your children, who will help the most and also be the ones being helped by this project.",2020.0,3.0,20.0,20:27:18,victim,

Any advice?,301.0,g9j03g,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g9j03g/animal_abuse_in_a_new_relationship_any_advice/,131.0,1588089212.0,"I've been seeing this guy for about a month now and we hit it off extremely well. Today he told me ""I almost killed Sephora""  (his tiny 4 month old Chihuahua mix dog) and I thought we was joking. Like how parents say they wanted to murder their kid for doing something small. I asked what she did. Apparently she bit through his PS4 charging cord and he grabbed the cord and whipped it against her head as hard as he could. Mind you, this dog is a puppy and maybe 4 lbs. 

I went to his house because after he told me what he had done, I thought he was still joking since his English isn't the greatest. This poor puppy  couldn't open her left eye and any touch around her face or head she yiped in pain. I asked his friend if what he did was true and he said yes.  I got so mad I had to leave immediately, and I called the police who stopped by for animal cruelty. The police haven't filled me in on what happened yet so I will wait until the morning...

I'm pretty conflicted because I was falling for him and up until this point I didn't see any signs that he would do something like this. I feel awful that I might get him in extreme trouble, but on the other hand I feel it necessary to have justice for this poor small dog that I love and played with every day I was over at his house. 

Another reason why I feel conflicted is because he grew up in a poor neighborhood in Puerto Rico and didn't really have a solid family foundation and these type of things might have seen occasionally in his household. So, was I wrong to have jumped the gun to get police involved? I feel like since he is young and immature he might have just made a mistake.  He's only 21 and his friend contacted me saying he probably made the mistake of hitting his pup because that's what he had seen in his upbringing. Idk. Any advice?


Edit: I have my own house and I am completely independent so I am not in any danger. As for the puppy I will follow up with police and HAWS which is an animal abuse hotline in the State of Wisconsin and see what they can do.  

The main reason why I posted this was because I felt bad about this guys childhood and how it might have impacted his awful decision to hit his dog. I will not be seeing or talking with him going forward. 

Edit #2: I don't have any leniency for what he did. But I was questioning if I should or not. That's kind of where my conflict within myself was at.  

Edit #3-5 : I changed some wording to make it seem less of a cultural thing about Puerto Ricans and normalizing abuse and more about a socio-economical thing and how in poor neighborhoods or broken families, abuse is more prevelant.  Some of you called me out for that (like 4 people), but I wrote this at 2am after an 11 hour shift  on my phone 🙄.

Then she asked me if we were planning on being together for the next 2 years.,2.0,gsvvst,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gsvvst/my_26m_girlfriend_23f_met_with_her_ex_on_saturday/,14.0,1590797695.0,"Hey everyone.

So last week, my girlfriends ex asked to meet up because he wasn’t in a good place mentally and needed a friend. He wanted to get lunch and see the cats they had when they were together. She immediately told me about it because she wanted to be open with me and then told me she let him know that we were together and she didn’t plan on leaving. They were together for a few years and were living together for over a year before he said he stopped loving her and they broke it off. 

On Saturday, she started acting differently. Her entire verbiage changed to more formal and she wasn’t really talking to me. I thought it was just me because I was a little shook about them meeting up. After all, I’m a guy and know guys say this kind of stuff all the time for nefarious reasons. 

On Sunday I asked her if everything was okay because she seemed different. She immediately changed her tune, was happy and everything went back to normal. 

She came up to visit me on Tuesday since I live an hour away at school since I’m a phd student and everything was great. On Tuesday we took a spontaneous day trip and had a really great time. But on the way back she asked me what my plans were for us since after I graduate, there’s a good chance I leave the area for a job and she has no intention of moving. I have over two more years before I graduate and I told her this was very early to have this conversation and anything can happen so putting a constraint on our relationship, making it a zero sum game was a bad idea. She’s an immovable object and Im an unstoppable force. And she knew this before we started dating. I told her that I wasn’t a person she should date if she wants a normal and stable life. I work a job with low job security, I make very little money, and move constantly. But I absolute love it. And I told her that I would never ask her to give up her life for mine, because I wouldn’t do that to her and because my life isn’t what she imagined. She wants a picket white fence, 9-5, summers on the beach, living near her family, and security. All the things I simply can’t provide for her. I work 80 hours a week, this is my 6th State in 6 years, and don’t ever want to move back home. I thrive in this environment. And she knew all these things prior to getting into a relationship with me. 

We talked about it and it really hurt me. Our relationship was one of the only happy things in my life so far. She’s the only person I’m vulnerable with after a lifetime of family abuse and bad relationships and now I feel like she changed our relationship. In my mind, there’s no way we can go back to being happy because now it’s out there we are going to end things and not on our terms but on a circumstance she imposed. I don’t want to break up with her because she’s been my lighthouse in the storm. Supportive, loving, and understanding at every turn. But I can’t get this out of my head now...

What do I do? What should I think? How can I go back to the way it was before? And most importantly, how do I fix this and get better for her?",2020.0,5.0,30.0,05:59:55,victim,80

So we found each other and we stayed friends for a good portion of our relationship, we helped each other through our hard times and really created a bond. There have always been issues but we’re in high school dealing with a relationship so it’s bound to happen. We never stayed mad at each other long and always got over things and talked them out.

Now, 2 years in, after everything, sh*t hits the fan. For about 3 weeks now I’ve been terrified to be apart from my boyfriend. I’ve lost trust for him, i cant depend on him for anything anymore and if i ask for simple courtesy’s he ignores them. My boyfriend has always been a great person and has dealt with family abuse since he was a child and I’ve always taken his home life into account if he’s having a bad day or if he’s snappy, I try to give him patience. But lately its hit a new level. He’s turning into his parents and beating me down like they’ve done to him. 

When we’re together it’s fine it’s like nothings wrong, we get along, we laugh and do normal couple things. he spends days at a time at my house since the pandemic started but when he’s apart from me he gets angry. If i get upset at him for doing something he turns into this person that i don’t recognize. He gets so angry and laughs at me for crying he tells me I’m pathetic for asking him to stop and crying and just leaves for hours at a time or he’ll just loose any care for me or our relationship all together and tell me im overreacting and I’m making a big deal out of nothing. This gets dragged out all day and night and i end up feeling terrible and like I’m a burden in his life. This has been happening for weeks now and i don’t know why i cant let go of him when he’s angry he’s begged me to break up with him but if I don’t afterwards he thanks me for not leaving and apologizes and it’s so conflicting because i want him to be in my life i want to share my life with him but i cant imagine having children with someone who could get so angry. 

We’ve tried talking about things, maybe I’m saying the wrongs things or understanding his side wrong. I don’t know what to do anymore I know i should leave but if we were happy once can’t we be happy again? Maybe there’s a way to help him deal with his anger or release it?

My girlfriend didn't like the fact that I still talked to my ex, who I only considered a friend. Before my girlfriend, I was lonely and depressed, due to a long history of family abuse and self-hatred, talking to my ex was a way for me to vent, without causing real damage. We were both broken people, and the talking just became a habit, of sort.  
Fast forward 4 years later, to 5 months ago. I fell in love with my current girlfriend, who made me feel alive again. She gave me a purpose to live on, and to believe that I too can be happy. And so I told her everything about me, about my past, about my talks with my ex, which I thought were harmless, and my gf didn't directly protest against that, only dropping hints about her dislike.  
Fast forward to March, we were in quarantine in different countries. The EU borders were closed down. I shared my PC screen with her, and she noticed that I still talked to my ex, and got mad at me because after all the hints she gave me, I was still too clueless to understand. We had a big fight, I begged for her back. I removed my ex, and my past from my life. I thought everything was alright, as it seemed so for a while. But yesterday, my gf confessed with me, that since that fight, she couldn't trust me anymore, she couldn't love me the way she did before, and she's still scared I'm still talking to my ex. I have tried explaining to her, that I have fully committed myself to this relationship, because I believe there's a future for us. But she wouldn't believe me, no matter what I say.  
I have been crying for 2 days now, I cannot stop crying. I think my depressive state is coming back. I don't know what to do. I want to save this relationship, because I really love this girl. I don't want to live without her.",2020.0,5.0,23.0,09:01:08,victim,

I'm sorry this is so long, it's a few incidents combined that came to a head today. 

For some background, both of my parents are \*recovering\* alcoholics. My mom went through years of AA and plenty of relapses, and my dad has never admitted to being an alcoholic but a few years ago started smoking marijuana instead. We had a very dramatic childhood which included a lot of verbal abuse and manipulation, and a handful of physical altercations when he was blackout drunk. I have an older brother who moved out of state and has very minimal contact with the whole family (after personally telling my dad he ruined his life), and an older sister who lives in the same city as my parents and me, all in separate homes. My dad's main personality traits are that he's a patriarch and a veteran, and brainwashed by Fox News. He and I have had a very contentious relationship as I became an adult. I refuse to lay down and take his bad behaviors, so we don't get along. I used to scream and fight back a lot but I've learned to be a lot more calm with my demeanor while still not taking his shit.

This whole story starts with the coronavirus outbreak. My birthday in early April I was going to be spending alone. The week leading up to my birthday, my parents called almost every day with ideas of how to celebrate. This was less than a month into our state's stay at home orders, and I did not feel comfortable with anything they suggested. I continually made my feelings very clear that I did not need or expect any celebration, suggested doing something online, mentioned that they weren't being sensitive of those feelings, but they kept pushing.

On the day of my birthday, despite my concerns I caved and I drove to their house to grab laundry. I masked up, and stayed in the garage to be greeted by them. My parents had a dinner and cake ready made for me, which I wasn't expecting. This was also around 4pm. I was in a calm mood, I told them that my stomach wasn't feeling good from lunch and I didn't know dinner was happening. I thanked them, but he kept pressuring me to eat a piece of cake. My mom offered to pack it up so I could take it to go and had no problems with me not wanting to eat right away. This is where my dad absolutely went off without warning.  

He accused me of being ungrateful, that I never ask about him or my mom. He said if it weren't for his ideas we would never celebrate, that his children are entitled millennials who are ungrateful and used to everything being handed to them. Saying if it weren't for my mom, none of his children would come check on him or even care if he was dying of the virus. This is because all 3 of his children do most of their communicating with mom because he is insufferable and a manipulator. I'm used to this kind of tirade so I let him continue for a long time. It wasn't until he started throwing names that I even spoke up and said how was I supposed to know that I was expected to eat cake? He kept going to the point where I quickly gathered my things and angrily got in my car to drive away. I wasn't about to sit around and continue to let him berate me on my birthday with no end in sight. 

After this incident, I blocked my parents phone numbers for some distance and went completely no contact for a month. My sister frequently told me that both my parents were pestering her to have me contact them so I could, ""come to some sort of agreement."" My mom even went out of the way to text the whole family, including my boyfriend, saying ""I'm so sad only one of my children is speaking to me."" My dad also said ""it's so sad your mother is being shunned."" I sent her a message saying it is incredibly unfair and rude to rope all of our significant others in on the drama, and only found out about the text from my boyfriend. Eventually I spoke to my mom and she apologized and I told her I don't see the point in trying to come to an agreement because I can never get a word in edgewise with my dad and I'd rather just let it go and continue to have as little interaction with him as possible for now. Eventually she roped me into coming back to their house because I had to help her with an errand he was unwilling to.

At first he tried to play it off like nothing happened again, but then sat me down and started with ""boobscomefromrussia you are SO WRONG."" Then begins another 45 minute tirade. He admitted he was triggered by me not wanting to eat the cake and said shouldn't I be proud of him that he recognized he was triggered? He said I did nothing to warrant his behavior, then he then belittled me for choosing to get out of the situation by walking away, and that he didn't understand my flight response. He said he rather I fought him back. He kept saying I was immature and childish and bring drama with me everywhere I go. (others have agreed he's the drama king in our family and the only drama I have in my life is with him.) He also said I don't appreciate my parents because I never grew up poor. He kept saying he was ready to listen to me, but when I tried to speak I get yelled at for interrupting and being disrespectful. This is a man who has openly told me in the past that as his child, he doesn't need to respect me. The only thing I was able to say was that I left for self preservation, and he laughed. He loves to go on and on about his pain and experience with PTSD so I sat and listened. Eventually I just said okay we need to go to my mom, or the place we were headed would be closed.

In the car with my mom I broke down crying. I told her that he'll never learn or listen to me. He makes everything with me personal. I told her I have so many repressed memories from him when I was growing up, and all my earliest memories are trauma related. I continue to have nightmares where I have to hide or run away from him because of the fear and anxiety I get from interacting with him. She was sorry but quickly changed the subject. I love my mom, but she will always take his side because he has complete control over her life and she would have nothing without his financial support.

This last incident was 2 weeks ago. Yesterday my mom called me crying saying she and dad are very depressed and she thinks he's starting to feel guilty because his eyes are finally being opened to his manipulative and abusive ways. She admitted she doesn't remember most of the abuse from our childhood because she was drunk and again apologized. I said that from my eyes it feels like his current depression is a manipulation tactic that he's used in the past, and he finds ways to blame me for the way he feels. He isn't ready to admit or hear about our trauma because he doesn't remember it and is in denial of anything he's ever done. 

This morning it exploded when my mom called saying, ""We're ready to hear your side of the story again."" Before I could start he's storming around saying he doesn't need help or my empathy, and goes off. The whole conversation was about his pains, his problems, and his feelings, his traumas, yet he kept saying he was ready to listen to me. I told him I no longer felt safe in this conversation, that I wasn't being heard, and at this point I see family counseling as the only opportunity to begin to heal from the years of trauma. He sarcastically asked me to be more specific and said I was being too vague. I angrily listed a handful of concrete examples (verbal abuse, choking, calling the police when he was threatening his life, having a burning candle thrown on me, etc.) and he completely ignored every example I gave. His tone immediately went to defensive and accusatory, all soaked in sarcasm. Things along the line of ""I'm soooo sorry your life has been ruined by me, it must have been all the times I hit and neglected you. You're right about me. I'm an evil man, I'm a deadbeat dad, sure you're right. Tell your brother I apologize for ruining his life. I'm sure your sister got into so much trouble because of my neglect"" I once again said I think we need to consider family counseling, and he said ""I don't understand and I don't see what family counseling will do. If you need mental help go ahead and do your thing and let me know when you're ready for me to join."" He asked what my diagnosis was, and then began speaking about his PTSD and his disability status and his anxiety, that he knew a lot more about pain and suffering than I ever would. I said I'm always willing to listen to him and that I care about him and his healing, but my feelings still aren't being considered and I cannot continue this way. The conversation ended rushed with him alluding to the final goodbye and my mother sobbing. I called her later to make sure she was safe and we both are scared of him doing something dangerous. This wouldn't be the first time he threatened his life. 

I have absolutely no idea where to go from here. My sister agrees she and I should try to seek family therapy ourselves at least to work through our own problems. My father is clearly unwilling to admit his problems and continues the cycle of manipulation. His ""come to jesus"" attitude was a farce. If it weren't for my love and pity for my mom, I would've stopped contact with him the day he threw a candle at me 5 years ago. I want nothing to do with him but I'm worried he'll hurt himself. My boyfriend thinks I should pretend that I admit I'm wrong to make amends and end this. He says life is too short to be this angry and I should play nicely.

484,6,9,I was scared more than once tonight,2.0,g86w4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g86w4f/i_was_scared_more_than_once_tonight/,6.0,1587898914.0,"Context: 1 month into self imposed isolation due to covid-19, tensions were running high in society. There were brawls popping up all over the country between hooligans and law enforcement. Even more alarming  was the reports of increased (both in volume and severity) family abuse. This was all over the news 100% reported as women being victims.

I had been with my significant other for 1 year and a half. We dated for a month, then she moved in with me. But after a few months she got a nice job offer from abroad which she accepted and moved away for a year before returning just as the lockdown was taking place in our country.

Incident: she had been pretty bad mood the whole day. I could tell because she bought strips to shave her tights which she insists has never done (truth be told very few women I’ve been with in the last 3 years have) and she was very passive aggressive about it.
We were watching some tv when I asked if it’s ok to go for an hour to play wow. She said yes. After an hour I come back to find her drinking a tall glass of red wine. I initially thought she was in the happy phase of drunk but I was wrong. She was her usual passive aggressive self, commenting on how all men are jerks and screw around which is a recurring theme for us. Conversation escalates and she is soon going through my messages with other girls (which were flirty) accusing me I slept with them. After, we hugged, went back and watched 20 more mins of the movie and she went to ro the bathroom. I noticed she didn’t come back and find her laying on the bed, in the bedroom. I sit next to her and ask her is she is coming back to watch the movie. She said “I don’t think I want to live anymore. I wanna be with my mum”. For context, her mother died when she was 18, almost 14 years ago. She gets up, and I kinda knew she was gonna do something...questionable. I followed her into the kitchen where she grabbed the first knife, fist clenched on the blade. I grabbed the handle carefully as to not pull it from her fangs while her second fist also clenched the blade.
Her: you want to hurt me, pull the knife through my palms
Me: no, I don’t want to hurt you.
Having both fists clenching the blade there was about 1cm left of the tip of the knife exposed. She takes the whole dagger to her neck, barely touching the tip to her neck while I was resisting her control of the knife .
Me: stop.
Her: why?
Me: because I don’t want anyone to get hurt.
Her: no, you don’t. You don’t care.
Me: I care about you and I care about me and i don’t want any of us to get hurt
Her: you only care about yourself.
She opens her mouth and tries to put the blade inside. I fight back.
Her: damn, we really need to get some better knives
She starts grabbing the blade with all her strength, knuckles turning white.
Her: I am squeezing and I am not getting cut. 
Disappointed, she releases the knife blade and walks out of the kitchen. I rest the knife on the table and turn after her. She doesn’t get far, 1-2 steps and collapses in the entrance to the living room. I drop next to her, call her name, check her pupils, shake her, check she hasn’t swallowed her tongue, checked her pulse, she had one, she didn’t seem she was breathing but after 10 seconds she was breathing fine (chest expanding, nostrils flailing).
I asked her what did she take, unfortunately she was full unresponsive. I quickly checked some chemicals we have lying around (medicinal alcohol, fabric softeners, nothing seemed to be missing) I ask her again what she took, and at this point she starts like convulsing but a few seconds later I realized it’s was in fact gag reflex. I got a pot, sat her upright and hold her hair while she was gagging in the pot. I asked her what she drank, she said wine and gin. I was expecting wine, still had like 80% of a bottle,P and figured she would burn through that, but not the gin. Thinking back, she probably drank around 300-400cc of gin. She pukes a bit, something like saliva with wine and collapses again. At this point I am pretty scared. I am about 40% sure that is she only drank wine and gin she will be fine with just a nights rest but what about the rest of 60% and what if she had more or even something else. I call 112. A lady answers and asks me very robotically what is my emergency. 
Me: this might sound stupid but I thing my girlfriend has an alcohol intoxication.
Her: you think!?
Me: yes she is unconscious.
Her: and it’s alcohol?
Me: that’s what she said and it seems to be true.
Her: so she is responsive?
Me: barely, she answers every 5 minutes and always single syllables
Her: ok, stand by, a car will be on its way.
Puts me on hold. While on hold I keep asking my girlfriend what she drank.
Woman on the line returns
Her: what is her age?
Me: 32, almost
Her: name?
Me:*&$#@
Now my girlfriend seemed to regain a bit of consciousness and started crying and yelling “no, don’t call anybody, I don’t want anyone to come” while still having her eyes closed and gagging and gasping every now and then.
Her: is that her?
Me: yes.
Her: and you are?
Me:*($#&, 31 years old
Her: and your address?
Me: #@$*& drive
Her: have you had any contact with anyone infected with covid -19?
Me: no, we’ve been in self imposed isolation for a month, we go out once per week for shopping, we have not had any symptoms.
Her: ok, a car is on its way, bye
She hanged up.
I leaned down to my girlfriend who was crying and yelling this entire time:
Me: babe, I need to know you will be ok, they will come check your blood pressure, maybe you need to have your stomach washed, maybe you just need hydration, still I am worried.
She, sobbing: no, you want to get rid of me, you want to put me in a mental hospital so you can get rid of me
Me: no babe, you are drunk, not mad. 
At this point she started crying that she doesn’t want anyone to come and I should promise her nobody will come while I reassured her this was for her health.
I managed to get her from the ground to the couch. For more context, she was wearing undies and a top. I was wearing shorts and a top. Pretty decent attire for summertime house clothes for us.
After 20 minutes she fell asleep I think. 10 minutes after that, the emergency responders arrived.
2 men. I open the door for them.
Me: good evening ( was around 23:30)
First man, Fm from now on, who was about 15 cm higher and 20kgs heavier (I am not that small 1.75, 85): You stay 3 meters away from me! (tone was really aggressive)
I assumed this was for corona purposes and complied obviously. Second man also entered, he was close to my build and stood quiet most of the time.
They walk into the living room and see my girlfriend on the cough:
Fm, gasping: what have you done to her!? How much did you give her to drink!?
Me: Me!? She’s a grown ass woman, she drank by herself!
Fm, to my girlfriend: did you puke?
Me, grabbing the pot from under the table and putting it at my girlfriend’s feet: yes she puked a bit
Fm, very aggressively: you, I said stay 3 meters away! Why are you showing me this?
Me: taking the pot away and then returning: I am not a doctor, I thought it was relevant for your medical process. And I don’t believe the attitude is warranted, I called you.
Fm, literally yelling: you called me?! Shut up! Stay at the door!
All this time, the second man was kinda nodding towards me as to reassure me everything is ok.
I was scared
It felt like I opened the door to a prosecutor while holding a bloody knife at a murder scene.
Fm, to my girlfriend: did he beat you?
Her: no, I am sorry.
Fm: no need to worry, did you have a fight?
Me: yes
Her: no, I am sorry you came, I am ok.
She starts crying
Fm, to my girlfriend: it’s ok, we will take your blood pressure to make sure u are ok. How much did you drink
Her: some wine and gin, I am fine
Fm, to my girlfriend: we need to ask these questions, you’ve seen the news, there are a lot of sick people hurting women nowadays. 
At this point it hit me. What was the course of events if my girlfriend answered differently. The first responder was in a very aggressive mood and the legal implications...
Me: that’s normal, the tone your are using is the problem, I called you. She isn’t some chick I picked up and got drunk to score (which was what I kinda assumed he implied initially) we live together for almost a year and this is not *&#&$@ ( shitty neighborhood with riots and a lot of violence)
Fm: I could not have known that.
I was amused that there was a frame photo of my girlfriend and me less than 1 meter from him, near my girlfriend’s head but...oh well.
The blood pressure was ok, Fm asked my girlfriend if she wants and IV or to go to the hospital, she said no, I gave them our IDs, some papers were written and they left.

I never mentioned her suicidal episode? Should I have mentioned it?

I return to her, she starts sobbing, I take her to the bedroom, thinking she will want to sleep.

Follows and hour of crying/panic attacks. She would lay down on the bed with me holding her, starting crying about how I hurt her, how I am mean, I don’t love her and how she wants to be with her mum (this last part, repeated over and over, and, in case you missed it, her mum is dead). At some point she would run out of air from the crying and would go into a panic attack. I would help her sit straight and calm her breathing at which point the crying would start again.

At some point she gets up and says she needs fresh air.
I panic, I grab her and hug her, she keeps pushing me to the balcony door, saying I don’t care anyway and she wants to be with her mother. I obviously, try to keep her away.
I tell her we should go in the living room and I will open a window if she wants fresh air (it’s a lot harder for her to go through some of the windows in the living room because there is stuff in the way)
We go in the living room, I open the most protected window and hold her from behind. She grabs the outside of the window with both hands and starts pulling herself out. I am obviously trying to prevent that. Then follows a 10 minute tug at which point she gives up and I bring her back to the cough. She starts crying again, saying she is sorry, saying she caused drama ( I always tell her I hate it when she causes dramas, that I don’t need that in my life), says I will make her feel shit when I remind her of this over and over...
I promised her I would never tell her (probably why I am writing this for the better part of 2 hours)
She fell asleep.
I stayed up all night, watching her. 

After 4 hours she went to the bathroom, then the bedroom to sleep, and I am here, next to her, writing this.",2020.0,4.0,26.0,16:46:54,victim,19

A little bit of background: Since my birth my mom suffers from a chronical illnes which is getting worse over the years and for which there is no cure. My father can't control his anger and was probably unable to cope with this situation in a healty way. Since my early childhood he was constantly yelling at me when a made ""mistakes."" At this time I thought this was normal behavior and I somehow deserved it. When I got older he started to hit (and even strangled) me when I ""misbehaved"".  
 I moved out when I was 17 and I wanted as little contact as possible. But I was always financially dependent on him and I felt obliged to take care of my mother (when I wasn't there he took out his anger on her.)   
I finally moved to another city and started to build up my own life. (This was a good excuse to distance myself from my family.) The abuse has never been addressed and i can't bring myself to confront my father. Due to my past, I am now suffering from severe depression, anxiety and trust issues but I am currently working on it.   
Of course I'm angry at my father but I'm also angry at my mom because she never stood up for me and she just let it happen.  
Today i just visit them at christmas and my moms birthday. When I'm there, my father often yells at my mom and she expects me to defend her but I'm always to afraid  to say something.  
My mom is always sad that I don't visit her more often. They want more contact and they still expect me to take care of my mother because of her declining health (she now is in a wheelchair and needs constant care.) I feel so bad and guilty to neglect her but I can't forgive my parents, I feel like a terrible person...

Should I learn to forgive them and start to help out more? Am I a bad person if I don't?",2020.0,6.0,3.0,01:16:00,victim,17
487,9,12,"I parted with my self harming, depressed gf, soon after she admitted she slept with another person while we were broken up.",2.0,g821v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g821v9/i_parted_with_my_self_harming_depressed_gf_soon/,3.0,1587880091.0,"I \[22M\] met her \[22F\] almost 3 years ago while in my home country. We did long distance for a little over 2 years (although I saw her in person pretty frequently). She has an extensive history of family abuse, and suffers from her environment to this day.

Over time, we continually had fights that I thought she picked out of the blue (of course, I was no perfect angel, and I contributed to some fighting as well). She questioned me over social media, accused me of cheating, etc. - all things I never did. Things got really bad in the last few months of our first 2 years, and she ended up dumping me 3 times in quick succession. The final dumping was horrible. I was blamed for all her problems, told I was an abuser, accused of being a narcissist, it was bad. It was bad to the point that I believed what she accused me of for some time. I suffered badly from that breakup for months. Perhaps I still have not even recovered from it. Anyway...

5 months after that final breakup, she got into contact with me. She told me she has been seeing a therapist, has been sticking to medications, and sees things so differently now. She apologized for a lot of what she put me through, and realized that I was not to blame for any of her problems. We had been ""back together"" since that for almost two months, until today when I parted ways.

The reason for wanting to part, is that about a week ago, she admitted that within days of dumping me, she started dating another guy, whom she ended up having unprotected sex with for a month, before she decided to cut it off. She says she met him after the breakup, and did not interact with him at all while with me. She technically did nothing wrong, but I am still hurt by it. I know she is disgusted by it too. Since admitting it to me, she has been extremely depressed, to the point where she has been cutting herself, in disgust for what she did.

What makes the situation 10x worse, is that 10 days after she dumped me, she came to my country, and stayed 30 minutes away from me on a trip with her family. At this point she had already been on a date with this other guy. She called me from her hotel room, interrogated me about stuff, and when she found out I had followed back someone on instagram that I was made to unfollow because for some reason my ex was insecure about her (I did it to spite her, since I thought it was very controlling of her in the relationship), she blocked me, and stayed the whole week without contacting me once. It stings so much to be so close to the long distance lover you have, and they don't want to see you because you've done nothing wrong. Meanwhile, they have already gone on a date days before, days after dumping you.

I would understand if she had interactions with other guys months down the road, but days? She claims she did not enjoy it whatsoever, that she was pressured by her friends to do it and move on, and she did it to deal with her own pain. She also says she was abusing alcohol, and was high all the time, and that didn't help her either. I believe her, regardless, I don't know if that is justification enough for me to force myself to get over the thoughts I have.

We both agreed that we are in a lot of pain right now, and I cannot continue to see her harm herself like she has been doing, over this problem. I cannot tell if parting was the right thing to do, or not. I love this girl with every fibre in my being, but on top of everything that happened, I don't know if I could live with the thoughts of another person sleeping with her, days after I was dumped and blamed for things I didn't do.

My dilemma now is I don't know if I am missing out on the great, changed (going through therapy, and the thoughts she would be a lot better if she moved away from her abusive environment) version of this girl whom I once new (at the beginning of the relationship), because I don't know if I can get over what she did while we were broken up.

So, together with him for almost 15 years now. He wasnt always an asshole but holy shit the years didnt do him well. He has gotten rough with me twice (once 14 years ago and I gave him back all his jewellery and told him to pound rocks lol but he promised he wouldn't ever again, and he made good on that promise again until new years 2019 when he put his hands on my throat and I packed me and the 12 year old up and we went to the shelter) but other than those two instances he isn't rough with me physically, just a right asshole.

Why did I stay? Good question, and I know the answer.  His kids. I met him when his kids were 3 and 5 and I knew mom and dad were a nightmare not soon in. I stayed because they needed someone to take them to the park ffs! I love them like my own but I am very upset right now at both of them. Why did I come home from the shelter? Another excellent question: I have a 12 year old son with multiple disabilities. He has a mild intellectual disability, some 3-D vision issues and has picked up an anxiety diagnosis, from dads inconsistentcy and the bullying at the old school before I had him switched to a developmental classroom (this year had been amazing! No mental health mornings at all! He just gets up and goes :) but it is very difficult to have an intellectually disabled 12 year old boy at an abused women's shelter. He cannot always be quiet, he has many fears and anxieties and doesn't always understand or remember not to run in the halls playing guns. The shelter is amazing, dont get me wrong, it's my boy who had a hard time adjusting so I brought him back to home base.

About a month ago my darling not so nice guy was diagnosed as bipolar.

On mother's day my step-daughter, now 18 and a half lol reached out to me to say happy mother's day and that she misses me; god I miss her too but I am so disappointed in her :( I responded back that I miss her and FYI: your dad has a diagnosis. I also quickly texted her mom and brother the news as well, especially mom, as this is news she shouldn't receive through the grapevine. My step son texts me back and says he thinks his younger sister also suffers, as she yells so much at her bf (21) who is living in her room at mom's house ffs that they are currently on a break (but living in the same room, poor kid).

I texted mom and step-daughter and step-daughter has agreed to go to the doctor, thank god.

Then, last night, about midnight, I get a frantic fb message from, get this, my step-sons (20m) girlfriends father, saying his drug addicted, self-harming daughter has gone missing again and is she, by any chance, with your step son? Yup, she was. This wasn't the first time he has contacted me about this either. And, he cant contact Dad, only step-mom, because dad renounces FB every time he gets caught messaging his his school lost love (these people I swear!!! Zero integrity!!)

So, I am done, son. They are 18f and 20m now and I can do no more. I have been back in contact with the lawyer that the shelter took me to, and we are working on a separation agreement (lol she says in private but when you have a spouse like mine there is no need, I clearly do everything anyhow). I will be applying for exclusive possession of our matrimonial home as soon as courts re-open in june :)

Questions/advice please: I love these kids but cannot condone this behaviour. How do I word it that I am walking away from the whole bunch, but would love to continue a relationship with them if they get their shit sorted? Do I, as step-mom of a long time, have an obligation to see them through their journey? I want to, I really do, but am up to here with enabling their mother and father.

Also, every bone in my body tells me to just tell my 12 year old that we cant be in contact with his half-sister and perhaps his half-brother (not sure about bro, but yelly yellerson for sure cant be around the kid) while they are abusing other people. Is this too much information?  I dont want to poison the well with him and step-sister, but for crying out loud she is abusing a sitting duck and that is super not cool.

We are both 16, We had sex a number of times (age of consent in our area allows that) and we aren't shy about most things so we openly discuss them. I'm the positive one, I always try to be the cheerful and helpful as much as I can, she is on the ""neutral"" side. She worries about everything, says it's her fault every time.  I never screamed at her and treated he asr best as I could. We see each other pretty often, but due the coronavirus we didn't see each other for like 1,5 month, so lately we had a couple of  dates.

The thing is that whenever we talk about her or her attitude, she starts crying, and saying how she doesn't want to talk about this. It appeared to me that it's really bad when i said to her that i don't want to meet tommorow because we won't see each other for long and I'm gonna miss her after she leaves ( i kinda regret saying that ) she said it's okay we kissed each other. Couple days later she says (after begging her to say what's the matter with her depressing attitude lately) that it hurt her pretty badly, she was crying the whole way to her home and she felt like shit.

We had a talk about this and she says it's her fault and she fucked up everything again, after reassuring her we both misunderstood each other and it's another thing we can start working on  so our relationship went a step further. She still thinks it's on her. 

&#x200B;

She has a history of family abuse. It would go on but i reacted and stopped that.

So there is this caste system in our country and my parents are Orthodox as hell. (Mainly my mom). They recently found out that my sister (elder) has a bf who is from the utmost ""low caste"". And my family is from the "" Top most high caste i.e. priests"". I knew she had a bf 3years ago and I gently said to her that our family would never accept him and she should consider before going further. Back then their relationship was just budding so I thought she would rethink. But she didn't. That guy pursued way hard. My sister had little to no experience with guys before. She's shy and very introverted. I came to know from other sources that he's really a good, caring guy. I thought this is just like any other college romance (like I had with few girls) and it would end soon. It's been 3 years and from the last year she ""backstabbed""our family by going with him, once a week or so by lying at house that she's going to office. I knew all the time but she asked me not to tell my dad. 
There is thing in our culture that parents choose the bride groom(from the same caste) for girls and if the girl likes him, they get her married to him. So a month ago my dad said to my sis that he would bring a guy home to see her and then she opened up and said she can't do it as she has a bf. Said this has been going on for 3 years. I feel so bad for my dad as he said on multiple occasions that his daughter would listen to him and would never bring a guy home (let alone a guy from ""low caste"" ). When my parents heard she has a bf they lost all respect on my sister. Not talking to her much. Asking her on a regular basis to break up with him because if she gets married to him all our relatives and friends would shame our parents (and me) that we let her get married to a ""low caste "". (Mind u the caste thing is really a big deal here). I don't give a damn abt caste, religion, god etc. So I'm ok with her marrying him if she wants to but my parents said they would never ever see her or talk to her again if she leaves our family and goes with him. And trust me they will do this. This happened with another girl in our family n she is living with her husband with no support from her parents and all her relatives. So her husband's family abuse her sometimes. 

I'm worrying that if she doesn't break up (she's so totally into this guy, as he is her first serious bf ever) and goes marries him, she would totally lose all ties to her parental family and the guy or his family might take advantage of this situation. I really don't trust anyone. I don't want my sister to end up with no help from our family. And at the same time I think she might end up doing something bad if she gets married to some guy whom our parents choose. (I don't know for sure if she can self harm or not, she might move on as there's no choice idk). 

What do you guys suggest me to do? Should I convince her to break up with him? (The guy's brother also had the same situation and his gf left him n married some other guy) .. If you would suggest me to convince her to break up then give me some ideas?",2020.0,3.0,13.0,20:52:32,victim,

She's also dealt with shitty teachers who humiliate her for her slightest mistakes at school, she's also been bullied and sexually harassed, I once had to fake a personality to get along with her ex boyfriend who kept her very damaging pictures on his phone which I rebooted to keep him from spreading them which he would've done.

She doesn't feel safe anymore and thinks that suicide is the solution to all her problems.

Most of the abuse comes from her Father who misunderstands her alot which leads to arguments and sometimes physical fights, he denies whenever he's wrong.

Her mother misunderstands her aswell but she tries to make things better and she acknowledges her mistakes, however she too can be unstable.

Theres the eldest (my brother, 27), me (the middle child, 26)and my younger sister(21). As an older sister to the youngest - i know sometimes sisters tend to idolize their elder sibling. I remember as a teen, she would follow and hang around MY friends and my parents (afraid of her tantrums) encouraged me to bring her along. As a teen this was fine because I didnt see anything of it. Until I stopped bringing her around, and she would wail and complain to my parents because I was leaving her ""out."" At that age, I had wanted to discover myself independently and have my own life outside of family.

&#x200B;

Then, i moved out of the country for college for Architecture school. I had 5 years all to myself where I could go out and meet people without having to be scared of upsetting my younger sibling for going out. I met my boyfriend - now fiance- and I honestly enjoyed living independently during those time. 5 years had passed and my sister moves out of the country TOO, to live with me. She follows the course I take, moves all her belongings with me and my parents tell me I have to be her legal guardian since they are in another country.

Now, her first year of college - She steals my car without a license, drives drunk and begs me after not to tell my parents. I become her parent figure, scolding her because that could have been lethal and she would end up in jail since she was underage, with no license and driving drunk. Shes not used to me being a parent figure and she thinks im doing it with malice and I want control over her. We argue and she concludes im a total bitch for telling her what to do. Shes used to getting her way with my parents by throwing tantrums but Ive acknowledged by this point I dont want to be coerced into letting her have her way whenever she throws a fit.

I was working by the time she was in college, so I come home tired from my first job and I come home to her friends partying at our shared place. We share a studio condo so Im forced not to wait out until her friends leave so I can rest after work. I literally wait at the lobby and sleep there until her friends leave. I work in the construction field and sometimes you come home at 2AM. I complain to my parents to let her know it was wrong but they always say the same thing - ""forgive your sister, you are still family, she is sorry for what she done."" Obviously, I listen to my parents and after a week i was in good terms again with my sister.

2nd year of her college - One night she comes home and she is wasted. At this age she is still underage and my parents and I have been calling her for 6 hours but she had lost her phone at this time. The fight escalates and we go at it physically. Shes stronger than I am and obviously drunk so I end up being beat up with bruises all over my face and body, she had ripped the shirt i was wearing and she pushes me out of the unit without shoes. I cry in the hallway with a ripped shirt with my bra showing, no shoes and my hair was a mess (i think i had some bald spots from the hair pulling) My phone is still in there and its 3am at this time. My neighbors look out at all the noise and they see me in the hallway crying. I was locked out with no key so I wash up in the public bathroom downstairs and took a taxi to my boyfriends house. I had no way of knowing if he would be at home, or if he was awake. I had no idea how to pay the taxi fare and was just hoping my boyfriend would wake up to help me. It was the most embarrassing thing in my life to be walking out of the condo with no shoes, a ripped shirt. I lost all of my integrity that night with the gaurds looking at me and the passer bys thinking I was crazy. The next day I feel like I was abused and cry to my parents, again they say ""forgive your sister, you are still family, she is very sorry for what she done."" However, this time she apologized through my parents and not directly to my face. My mom cries to me to let me know her health is not great and if we keep fighting she will suffer from a stroke or something.

I come home from work one day and she has her lesbian partner to stay with us. Obviously, 3s a crowd in a very small studio apartment. I tell her that her partner has to pay rent if she wants to stay with us just to be fair and we argue. I end up being the one kicked out of the apartment. Im lucky my parents have just purchased another condo unit at this time and Im kind of relieved.

2nd year of her college -I move out and move into my parents newly purhcased condo, im excited about it and I paint the walls myself decorate it and make it feel comfortable for myself. Its further from my workplace, (i have to ride the bus 2 hours longer than if i were to continue living with my sister) but I dont mind. Its a 1 bedroom so its larger than the condo my sister and I shared. Guess what? My sister breaks up with her girlfriend and lets me know she likes my place better. She wants to stay there 4 days a week when she doesnt have class because she feels claustrophic in the smaller apartment. Im coming from a place where I was just kicked out and tell her HELL NO. She complains to my parents and lets me know that this is their property and Not mine and i have no right to kick her out. My dad sides with her and since he lives in another country he wanted the fight to end and instructed me to give her a set of keys. 

3rd year of her college - My sister complains that our family car honda civic (2009) is not good enough, its old  and worn. She persuades my parents to buying the latest toyota fortuner and they do buy it. 6 months after, she totals the car in a drunken crash - nearly ends up in prison and the car collides into another family, i was so thankful no one was hurt or killed. I was about to start my meeting for a design competition at this point that could launch my career when I received the phone call of the crash. I ditch the meeting and rush to the police station. My parents fly in to settle with the other  family. They demanded for a hefty sum and we had to pay it off. I never got to participate in the design competition and let it go.

&#x200B;

4th year of her college - She becomes very dependent of me, and she asks for help on her thesis. 2 days before her submission she had nothing. With my parents persuasion I help her and she gets a score of 93/100. I expect her to be so grateful for my help but a few days later we argue about me going to my boyfriends house and I get pounded

&#x200B;

Im fed up with my low paying job at this point and start my own firm with my boyfriend. Im honestly hoping i can earn more so I can afford my own property so I can live on my own terms and she wont be following me around anymore.

My parents keep telling meto be sorry and to be patient but I think at some point i hope theyll look at me and the responsibility theyve given me. Im kind of fed up of them favoring her and her feelings.",2020.0,5.0,8.0,01:02:08,victim,27
496,19,22,My Uncle Verbally Abused Me and My Whole Family and Won't Apologize-- What Next?,3.0,glnslk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/glnslk/my_uncle_verbally_abused_me_and_my_whole_family/,4.0,1589779678.0,"Hi all. Sorry, this is a really long one, but I would really appreciate some help.

TLDR: My uncle verbally abused me and my family and has zero remorse, but I can't completely cut him off. What do I do?

In February 2020, we (me, my grandmother, father, stepmother, brother, uncle, and aunt) had a nice birthday dinner for all the recent birthdays. I (F21) am a dedicated cook, and made a semi-elaborate meal for everyone, taking all requests (charcuterie board, ratatouille, cauliflower gratin, homemade pie, hand whipped cream, and more), most of which came from my Uncle (M48). I was more than happy to accommodate! I made sure there were both vegan, keto, and pescatarian options. I love being able to provide food to my family as an expression of love. I made sure we had a big bouquet of flowers as a centerpiece, I really tried to do the damn thing, especially since my grandfather had passed in August and we all really were (and still are) missing him.

At the end of the dinner, my grandmother made an extremely innocent comment in passing. It was roughly ""Isn't it so sad about \[insert recently deceased celebrity's name here\]?"" and instead of being like, ""Yes, very sad"" my uncle challenged her in a really aggressive and domineering way. He went OFF about how celebrity culture is a cancer and how sycophantic 99% of people are because they all buy into this idea of ""celebrity."" He gets like this sometimes (more than one gathering has been ruined because he just won't. shut. up. One time he ranted about how 9/11 was an inside job for an HOUR AND A HALF at a family lunch), and I was so sick of it. No one ever challenges him, so I finally was like ""I disagree! I don't think there is anything wrong with people being sad about someone who impacted their life passing away. I just don't think I'm smarter/better than everyone who is saddened by this."" He pushed back and I said, ""I just don't feel I'm as superior to them as you feel you are.""

HE BLEW UP AT ME. Now while this is obviously an oversimplification of the conversation, I swear this is an honest representation of what we said, except he was swearing a lot (not something anyone else really does in front of my grandmother), so there was really no way of thinking it would escalate like this, other than knowing he can be a total jerk sometimes (yelling at his wife in front of family, hitting his dogs, etc-- a real winner). He went wild-- shouting at me, swearing at me, calling me names, challenging me (I remember he shouted ""JUST MAKE A FUCKING POINT"" repeatedly, then would cast off whatever point I made).

I hate this about myself, but men's raised voices tend to trigger something in me and make me cry (my alcoholic mother's alcoholic second husband is extremely abusive and yells a lot, as does she, and I've been around that since I was 6, so I'm sure that has something to do with it). So there I am, crying (trying not to, biting my cheeks so hard they bled *a lot*), shaking, and saying over and over ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you upset, I'm sorry, you were right, I was wrong"" just saying whatever I could to deescalate the situation and move on. Meanwhile, my grandmother is in hysterics, screaming and crying and yelling ""Make it stop, make it stop."" His wife has left the table, along with my stepmother, just to get away from the situation. My father (ultimate conflict avoider, but also frequent peace maker) had been silent. My baby brother was next to me, I couldn't tell what he was thinking (I knew he was upset, but I didn't know if it was at me or our uncle).

My uncle says something to me along the lines of ""You think you're so fucking smart, but you're not,"" which barely stung at all (I know how smart I am-- enough to know how much I don't know), which for some reason was the breaking point for the two men sitting near me. My father interjected (""Hey now, let's settle down--""), but didn't finish before my teenage baby brother came to my defense. He shouted ""DON'T YOU TALK TO MY SISTER LIKE THAT!"" and stood up in a rush. My uncle, a nearly 50 year old adult, stood up across the table and puffed up at the teenager confronting him. He made an allusion to the fact that the next time my brother ""did that again"" he (my uncle) would ""do a lot more than just yell,"" and continued to scream (now at me and my brother). My father was between them in a flash, hands on each chest, trying to calm everyone down. My brother was fairly calm, but my uncle had gone nuclear.

I left the table to hold my grandmother who, a few feet away, way clearly having a panic attack. I held her up as she almost fell to the ground, hyperventilating, sobbing, and clutching at me. After a long time of my dad speaking to his brother in a calm, reasonable manner, he gave up; he left with his wife my brother, I went downstairs (I wasn't going to leave my grandmother alone with him). He ranted and raved some more to no one in particular and left an hour or so later in a huff. I went upstairs and held my grandmother as we both cried.

I texted him and apologized, he was snarky in response, I left it alone.

It has been several months, he has not offered an apology to anyone and has zero remorse.

What do I do? I hate being around him, my already bad anxiety gets extremely elevated just thinking about having a conversation with him. I feel like anything I say, no matter how innocent, could get conflated into another giant argument (and what if it happens when my dad isn't around? Will he hurt me? I have a feeling it wouldn't be a huge leap for him). I **HATE** the idea that the lesson I'm supposed to take away from this is to be a good little woman and keep my trap shut while a man is talking, but I seriously don't know what else to do while being around someone so irrational (this is made more painful because of the environment my mother raised me in-- talk back, get hit).

Can anyone offer advice about being around someone like this? I can't avoid him totally (my grandmother would never cut contact with him, and she is the most important person in my world). Does anyone have a way of looking at this situation that might help me find some peace? Advice on how I could have handled this better? Really, any and all feedback is more than welcome.

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this and respond, I'm so grateful!",2020.0,5.0,18.0,11:12:58,victim,11

I just turned 25 last week and a few days ago I had gotten into an argument with my younger brother about his loud noise from playing games till 4 am and I had asked him why he didn’t look like he had slept in days. He began going off on me saying my job was nothing, and that he hated me. The fight escalated, and words were said. 

Two hours later my father comes home, and tells me to give him my phone. I do, and then he slaps me and puts me in a chokehold.

I told my mom to watch the video of him attacking me from our ring camera and she said that basically he was angry and took it out on me. I tell him it’s not ok to hit me and he will never and he said he would knock my head off and do it again. 

On another occasion he threatened to shove a list of ridiculous rules up my ass and said if I wanted to stay here I have to pay rent every week when I’m the only one who works and listing what clothing I was and wasn’t allowed to wear. Certain logos aren’t allowed. It said apologize to everyone for my bad behavior. He beat me and destroyed half of my belongs. No apology there? I have bruises on my neck and arms.

I was abused from the age of 8 until 15 by my sisters boyfriend (now husband) - in between my abuser tried to rape me when I was staying over their place. I fought him off and threw a hard toy that belonged to my niece, on the floor to make noise. My sister woke up because of the noise and I ran out of the living room, she asked me what happened the next day and I told her. She asked me not to tell anyone - especially mum. I didn’t. 
Next year ( I was 15) I went back to Angola for holiday (where they and my mum lived) and I was persuaded to have sex with my abuser (in his late 30s then). Everything came out and I was blamed by my mum and my sister. My sister left him for a few months and then went back with him and they had another kid together. 
Then they decided to get married and my mum helped organise their wedding. My sister would treat me like shit and my mum didn’t do much. 

Now I am 21 and have confronted them both about what has happened and told them I was also abused from the age of 8. I have cut all contact with my sister. My mum has admitted her wrongdoings and has also spoken to my sister who still wants to be married to my abuser. 
My mum speaks on the phone quite often with my sister and I feel like she doesn’t hold her accountable enough. We have various arguments about this as I feel like she doesn’t hold her accountable. 
I understand it’s her daughter so she will never cut her off, but am I wrong to be upset when they talk often? 
What should my expectations and boundaries be here ?

If it doesn’t let me know. Sorry in advance for the long and possibly messy post. Not sure if it’s needed, but TW for child abuse, self harm, and suicide threats (again, it’s a lot and sorry in advance). 

Over the past year, especially in a past two months due to covid, I’ve been realizing that certain aspects in my life may not be okay when it comes to family. My family who I live with consists of my mom, stepdad, brother (12), and sister (5). I’m 15 and use they/them pronouns, but my family doesn’t know. I also live in the US. I’m used to being told by my family that I’m just overreacting and over sensitive to everything, so now I wanna see what strangers on the internet think lol. 

Growing up, back when my mom and her ex were still together (I’m biologically related to him but I refuse to refer to him as such due to him being abusive to my family and I), there were multiple times when my brother or myself were upset about something we were told that if we don’t stop crying, we would be given a reason to cry. I’ve always taken this as a threat of being physically hit, and I still think of it that way. Both my brother and I have been hit by our mom and her ex as a lesson if we misbehaved, did something wrong, etc. but my brother had it worse than I did. Whenever my mom and her ex got into arguments, I would be put in the middle of their arguments and had to pick a side (note that the oldest I was during these arguments was 13 but I remember many times where I might have been between 10-12 where it’s happened). My mom did this more than her ex.

Around two years ago, not long before my mom and her ex separated, her ex would hit my brother (11 at the time) with a belt or wire when he misbehaved. He would also make me (13 at the time) watch and be in charge of my sister (3 at the time) and if something went wrong I would be in trouble and yelled at. He’d also call my sister retarded after finding out she’s autistic. Keep in mind, she was 3. 

There was also a time two years ago where he got into an argument with my mom and afterwards he told me (13 at the time) that he took all his medication and to call my mom and tell her. He then went to sleep and I couldn’t get him up. I ended up calling my mom crying and panicking. He was fine and didn’t take all his meds, only sleeping pills which is why I couldn’t wake him up.

Anyways, my mom isn’t an angel either. She’s made comments towards me relating to my appearance, insecurities, and made fun of them before. In the past I’ve had hygiene issues because I lack motivation for most things and my mom would make comments about it, such as this is “why you have no friends”, “You look like a dirtbag” and etc. Ive had problems with making and keeping friends for years because of trust issues which my mom has made fun of multiple times. For a while I also had bad anxiety whenever left alone which would also be made fun of. There were multiple times where I would have anxiety and panic attacks and she would make fun of me for them and claim I’m overreacting, usually in hearing distance as I’m having them. A few days ago she said “If you spent time with your father (her ex) again, you’d realize how spoiled you are and how good you have it with me”. I was on the phone with my friends at the time but I hope they didn’t hear it. 

Sometime last year there was also an incident where I came home and my mom was in her car with a knife saying she was going to off herself. I ended up having to be pulled away from the car because I kept trying to talk to her and kept crying. I don’t think that’s something an at the time 14 year old should go through so that’s probably why I was pulled away. She was okay afterwards and is still alive.

My brother often calls me slurs, hits me (I’ve gotten in trouble before for defending myself and he tries to get me in trouble if I tell my mom), hits and tries to fight with one of our dogs (our dog tries to run and if I’m in the room he’ll try to hide behind me), yells and swears at me usually for no reason, and tries to get me in trouble for things I haven’t done. It’s gotten to the point where my friends who have heard of what he’s done either from me or while I’m on the phone with them don’t like him at all and one has even suggested possibly getting the police involved which I’m not going to do. Keep in mind, he’s currently 12.

So that’s the stuff I can name off the top of my head. Because of quarantine and not being able to get out of the house everything has greatly affected my mental health and I’ve turned to a bad coping mechanism because of it, but one of my friends who’s aware of this is doing whatever he can to help me and I’m trying my best to stop doing it. Quarantine is also making me rethink my entire life so that’s why this post exists now. I’m 15 so even if my family is the problem, I’m not sure if I can do much for the next 3 years.

English isn’t my first language so I apologize in advance for bad grammar or spelling. 

my boyfriend and I have been together for six months. We’ve had a very good relationship, especially because we communicate a lot. 

He has been diagnosed few years ago with clinical depression and takes antidepressant, which had always helped him feeling “normal”. He tried to stop them last summer and it went very badly, he did multiple suicide attempt, so he had to go back on his meds. 

Lately (for about a month) he’s been very down, he sleeps all day, has panic attacks, repetitive nightmares, constantly compares himself to others, ask me why I even love him, that he doesn’t deserve to be loved.  
it breaks my heart. I love this man with my whole heart, I love every part of him and I just wish that he could see himself the way I see him. 

The worst part is that I’ve been depressed, I’ve tried to kill myself many times when I was younger due to familial abuse. The thing is, I don’t remember what helped me getting through this horrible phase of my life. I feel like I should be able to help him, having experienced a similar situation, and I am completely helpless. 

I don’t want to patronize him by telling him what to do to feel better, so I am coming to you to ask anyone with a similar situation or experience or knowledge on the subject.

Thanks in advance for reading.

My wife and I have been together for 10  years.  We met in grad school, and sparks flew.  Instant connection, shared interest in creative work and living abroad.  Incredible sex.  The whole works.  Even today we can stay up all night talking and laughing.

After graduation, I followed her to her home state.  It was at this point that I was exposed to her family.

Absolutely insane.

I realized a few things.  I grew up in a very tough household, and being somewhat rebellious, expressed my emotional independence at a young age.  My wife grew up in a very similar household, but sort of went the opposite way: instead of rebelling, she became the caregiver for her divorced parents.  They're both extremely selfish and constantly demand that she prioritize them emotionally.

After two years of this, my wife was crying every single day about her family.  I was also beginning to get stressed about how I might get stuck in this web.  By this time, I'd managed to  become a remote freelancer.  Things were really beginning to take off -- it wasn't amazing money, but it was solid, especially for living abroad.

My wife was convinced (after a year of her bargaining with her family) to take a leap of faith.  We got married and left the country.

For the next several years, we lived and traveled throughout the world.  It has been an incredible experience for us both.  We've both made close friends from around the world, she transitioned to a career she loves, and I began to slowly build my creative skillset.

Now, come 2019, I was getting a bit tired of my freelance work.  We also both wanted to move forward and get some long-term projects/plans underway.  But we didn't want to throw our whole lifestyle away -- we ultimately decided on moving to a particular city and finding jobs there as a stopgap measure.  My wife wanted to be somewhat closer to her family, so being back in the US (but in a different region) was a compromise.  We were both fine with this decision.

Then the pandemic hit while we were visiting her family house.  We've been stuck here for months under the same roof.  And suddenly I get a two page letter about how she wants to put her roots down HERE, have kids HERE, etc.

She comes from a wealthy community, and all her friends and family have been nagging her about our nontraditional lifestyle, which at first they thought was ""daring"" and ""cool"" but now think of as foolish.

In any case, we fought over it.  She constantly says now that we have fundamentally different values -- and that there's nothing wrong with wanting one's family to be at the very center of their life.  I felt as though I'd been betrayed.

I calmed down after our initial fights and said: ""If this is a request, then I'm sorry, but no.  I don't want to be here.""  She exploded.  She refuses to try and resolve this any further since ""we shouldn't fight while we can't leave the house during the pandemic.""

Meanwhile, her mom and dad are spending all day every day in her ear, whispering in a foreign language in hushed tones so I can't decipher what they're saying.

I know she wants kids and more stability.  I've accepted that and am willing to make those compromises.  I'm even willing to move back to the USA (not my original intention with my life).  But now I have to move back to the same city/region as her family?  This is just too much!

We've barely spoken over two weeks, and our relationship is rapidly deteriorating.  She is now seemingly willing to get a divorce over this.  I honestly don't know if I've just been dragging her along all these years, forcing her to live a nontraditional life that she didn't want -- but I was so cautious and always made sure that she wanted this life, too.  So I don't really understand where the resentment is coming from, unless she felt she couldn't tell me how she ""really felt"" this whole time.

And if this is how she truly feels -- and it's not  the influence of her family and friends -- then I'm honestly not sure I want to be with someone who couldn't even express their true feelings over 10 years of being together.

My brother is constantly verbally, mentally, physically, and emotionally abusing all of us, especially me and my mom.

My brother is a very smart kid, top 10 in his class, gets straight As, etc. but unfortunately he uses that to verbally and mentally abuse me every day. 

I seriously can’t think of the last day where I’m at home where he hasn’t called me a loser or asked why I’m not going to college (I took a gap year) or said that I have no friends. He says I am a pathetic loser who will always be beneath him. This is constant... an always on barrage of “Why don’t you got to college?” “Why are you such a loser” “Get some friends loser” “Learn how to go to school.”

He is completely two faced. He is extremely nice to people at school and has a lot of friends, but is just horrible to his family.

He comes into my room sometimes and just knocks stuff off my desk or dresser. He steps on whatever I have on the floor. He knows i won’t do anything to escalate it...

He pushes me around because he’s bigger than me. Again, he knows I won’t do anything and he won’t be punished for it.

Although he targets me the most, my mom isn’t spared either.

My mom works all the time for an NFL team, sometimes working 15 hour shifts. When she comes home at midnight or 3 in the morning he always makes her cook or make him something to eat.

If she doesn’t he goes insane and starts screaming about how she’s a pathetic loser and needs to get a real job. Or that she’s lazy and a terrible mom.

He steals my moms money constantly. Using her credit and debit card to buy CS:GO skins or $300 Gucci slides. Nothing is done.

He won’t even tell my mom what college he’s going to or if he’s even been accepted to one of the many top schools he applied to.

This isn’t even to mention the fact that out of the blue he decided to completely cut my dad out of his life and start hating him. Everyone knows my dad didn’t do anything to him, but he still just ignores him and says he’s a horrible dad. He even went as far as to stop seeing my grandma and grandpa on my dads side.

Today I hit my breaking point. As my mom was preparing dinner and I was bringing my plate over to the table he told me to move. I told him to hold a second. (I was getting silverware). He didn’t want to wait so he pushed me into the counter top.

After the literally years of constant abuse I decided I had enough. I turned around a punched him in the face. 

This is where things get bad. My mom seeing as she hasn’t done anything about my brother so far, HATES when anyone stands up to him. My mom grabs me. My sister grabs him. 

He gets loose and tries to attack me so I punch him again.

He then runs upstairs and grabs some kind of metal pipe and starts to smash my room to pieces. He destroys my monitor and is about to smash my fish tank when my mom stops him.

The reason that I don’t hit him more often is because he threatens to call CPS and the cops because I am technically an adult and he is technically a minor (even though there is less than a years difference between us). I don’t know what would happen if they showed up even with all the proof I have of him being the tormenter and instigator.

Of course my mom is now mad that I hit him. Not to even mention that he pushed me first and not to mention that he torments all of us every single day.

After the fact she always realizes that he is the problem and that he causes it but whenever something happens she immediately starts screaming.

I’m not in the wrong here.... right???? 

What do I do??

I'll keep it short. I had known her two years before she told me about her childhood abuse and then three years later I told her whole family. I will get to why in a moment.

Ever since knowing my partner she struggled with her mental health, mainly anxiety and depression although the abuse may not be the root cause it is definitely what bothered her most.

Now to why. We have been together 5 years at this point. One day she went manic, became aggressive and was hallucinating. She was in hospital for a month. Before all of this she tried to get help, she tried to talk her family and tried to get family counselling etc. Her family are not very supportive and their responses were things like ""don't say anything"". Again her abuse may not be the root cause but it is definitely what bothered her the most and I wanted her to get the help that she needed and she was in the best place for that so and the risk of ruining our whole relationship and the relationship with her family I told everyone, nurses, doctors, her counsellor and her family.

I have skipped things like how shitty her controlling and manipulative family are because the main point here is that I told her biggest and most personal secret to everyone because I wanted her to get the help she needed.

In a normal situation I would have never done this, ever. I was worried she would lose herself for ever and I didn't want it to be too late. Now there is a strain on our relationship, her family hate me and it may never work out now but she is getting the help and support she should have been getting from her family and the doctors etc years ago... 

So. Has anyone been on either side of this and was it wrong for me to speak up?

Thanks.

For some background, my mom can be cool at times and she's always provided for us for all our lives. Shes hard working and takes care of her family to the best of her abillity. I have 5 siblings, 3 older and 2 younger, and half of us are living in a house with my grandparents (my mom's parents) currently.
My first 2 older siblings (now 24m and 23f) are from a different dad and from what I learned, he was a deadbeat, abusive, and ditched her and my siblings. My dad came into her life sometime after with a daughter (now 23f) of his own and they soon moved in together when they had me. Time passed and they had my younger siblings (now 16m and 11f). Now, my half sister came around every so often but the rest of my siblings and I feared her growing up. My parents could get scary at times and my mom was the worst when it came to discipline. She would pull our hair, hit us, and scream at us when we acted out. So throughout my whole life I stood in line, but being around her was mostly bearable.
In recent years, shit has gone downhill and she became a very toxic person to live with.

In 2015/2016, my mom had an affair with another man who we did not know at all. My dad was forced to move out and my mom had us pack all our things and move in with this guy very far away. My older brother and half sister had their own lives, so it was just my older sister and younger siblings. Things between my parents were very hard and bitter in the bugging of their split up. My dad was completely heartbroken and confused and sought comfort in family members and church friends, but it really strained our relationship with him because he always questioned us about the other man. I was very lost with my emotions and grew anxiety from my sudden life change. But my mom always told me, "" I've always done what's best for you, dont you want to see me be happy finally?"" And so I believed it and kept my feelings to myself.

Fast forward 3 years, my mom and her bf broke up after all the years of arguing, lies and cheating on each other. My older sister had gone into the navy and moved across the country with her new husband. My half sister had lived with us for a while with my nephew but my mom kicked her out because apparently my sister ""used"" her, and now they have no relationship. My older brother, his gf and my niece moved into our house with our grandparents. And my dad and mom are finally rekindling their relationship.
My mom is now a very bitter and mean person that we absolutely cannot stand. She complains about anything she sees done wrong and will literally make your day bad if she's having a bad day. Now, she does literally nothing in the house, she works all day to come home to dinner and a bed that was already made for her. But she has the audacity to nag about a stupid shirt that wasnt folded correctly in her nice pile of laundry.

My dad has literally been through fucking hell and back with this woman. He never moved on from her, but instead kept trying to get back with her to help raise me and my younger siblings. Now that he's back, with a new found patience and kindness that he never had before, she treats him like dogshit. She always complains that he's not smart, that he's fat (hes not, just really buff), and that he does nothing. Meanwhile he works, comes to my house (he's still technically living with my other grandparents) to clean up HER room, and makes sure that my siblings do their chores. I've told him before that he did not deserve her, and should just let go of her. But he really does love her even though she drives him crazy. She also has driven him to buy a lot of things for her and us, because she is a big spender. And he's been stressing out lately because of it.

My nana is another person that revolves her day around my moms needs. They have the same traits and can be overbearing at times, but my nana has really complicated health problems (survived cancer, had surgery that resulted in her having a bag connected to her, and has a broken hip). And my mom holds little respect for her because she blames her for why my aunts and uncle dont talk to her. In reality, my mom nags at my nana and gets upset with her for stupid things and my nana vents to them.

My older sister in the navy also has a love hate relationship with my mom. She's pregnant rn with her 2nd child and her first child is stuck in our state due to the pandemic. We were supposed to get my niece back from the baby daddy's side of the family, but my sister revealed that shes upset that my mom wasnt truthful about a incident with the baby months ago. 

My older brother and his gf are very fed up with my mom because she complains OUTLOUD about them to us. She criticizes them for their parenting skills, financial stuff, their dogs that they do take care of. They are trying to save up to move out of course.

My younger brother also has a temper and has stood up for himself to my mom. But does so in a way where he goes to far. Like hovering over her and shiz talking her, and I'd have to intervene and stop him. My dad almost disciplined him after he started cursing at him and my mom but my mom stopped my dad.

My little sister has it the worst. She was young and the most impacted by my parents separation. My moms ex was mean to her, my mom constantly puts her down, but blames my younger brother and I for why she acts out so much. She does have some behavioral issues, and she does annoy me. But I try not to be so cold just because she's had it worse.

Personally, I've been put down by her for my weight, and how I am as a person. She has told me that I'm ugly when I cry, that when I go out with friends that I better not be annoying. In school, I would get yelled at for having anything lower than a A on my progress reports or actual report card. I never had a good high school or middle school experience because of her. She pulled me away from my friends and schools. I always clean up for her and still get nagged to death because I forget to do one thing. I feel like no matter what I do, it's never good enough. Also if I dare help my older siblings with anything, she gets mad at me for ""letting them get away with not taking up their responsibilities.""

My mom now has this paranoia that that world is out to get her. We mention her name or have any conversation she's always listening. She assumes the worst in all of us and argues about every single opinion we have on any topic. I'm in fear of trying to move out because I feel like shes going to hold me back. I'm planning on paying for community college and trying to figure out how I'm going to move out in the future without her going ballistic on me.

I honestly believe she needs therapy. But singling her out would make the situation worse. I dont know what to do. I worry for my dad and younger siblings. I'm sorry if this is long and messy, I'll answer any questions. 
Also just confronting her is NOT an option, talking to her would lead to her being offended and the situation going her way. She. Is. Never. Wrong.

TL;DR: My mom is verbally, mentally and sometimes physically abusive. Shes extremely bi polar (not diagnosed) and acts like the world is out to get her. My family revolves their day to fit her needs when all she does is come home from work, complain, do nothing, and sleep.",2020.0,5.0,22.0,12:39:21,victim,24

I (17F) have a friend, we'll call her A. A and I have been friends for the better part of a year or so. However, she goes through periods where she picks a fight (just accuses me and gets mad) with me over small things, like if I make a joke or say something, that to me, is just normal. During these periods she is very irrational and puts words into my mouth, I think it's a mix of what I say, how she percieves it, and what she thinks of herself. These periods can last up to a week or more. A few examples: I asked A to please stop telling me what another guy was sexually into, she said that was odd because just before I had found it funny, and somehow it let to us fighting. I once, after she said ""I'm sorry"" (after I had explained a family issue), compared that sentence to how people say ""Bless you"" after you sneeze, like its a must. I realized right off the bat that that wasn't probably the best thing to come out of my mouth and attempted to explain my thoughts, but she took it as an offense, claiming I didn't appreciate her or our friendship no matter what I said.

After these angry periods, she gets very apologetic and tries right away to put things back as they were before (hangouts, texting, etc). We both have family issues (she has stated before numerous accounts of verbal and even physical abuse from her family, but I haven't actually witnessed any), and A is a very kind, sensitive (to a fault), hardworking, and nice to everyone. However, I think she is a little too sensitive, and I've let her know my thoughts before (maybe not the smartest idea). It's good to be sensitive; it makes you aware of others' feelings and far more empathetic, but with her...she takes everything very personally, from teacher's comments on work to jokes from her friends.

Through several fights I've learned not to lose my temper and make sure to listen and think before I say. Despite this, she still says I'm rude, even though I try to not say anything she may take as mean.

I've tried to figure it out before. Maybe it's because of her low self esteem and low self worth, combined with family abuse. Maybe she has an illness, but I'm no doctor. Or maybe she likes to start fights, or really wants attention? I don't know, and I'm scared to assume (makes an ass out of you and me, you know that saying). 

I've also asked myself if I was the problem. I'm not a very warm person- I don't say hi to everyone, I tend to keep to myself around classmates, I don't talk to cashiers when they ring me up (besides a quick ""how are you""), I don't hug everybody or just say compliments randomly, I say what I think and what I mean. Now I'm no heartless monster, I still love those I care about, friends, family or S/O, and I try to express it as best I can (with others, more so, you learn what types of gestures people like). Am I too brash? Too honest? Do we just not mix? We've been through some shit together and I'm supportive and always willing to lend a helping hand if she needs one.

As of writing she's cut contact with me again (as in just today). If she apologizes (not that I need one, I'm just so confused), should I continue our friendship? Or leave her life for good, let her find someone else, or stay with her and possibly continue this cycle? Should I apologize? Do I cut off contact? Any advice is appreciated- be honest.

It strained our relationship pretty badly, to the point where we were barely talking after they said I couldn't bring Jake to my eldest brothers wedding. I was really heartbroken over it, especially as time went on Jake and I started fighting more. He hated that I was trying to become an influencer, hated that I wasnt making a lot of money at my day job. He even hated my cat. One night after an argument, he slapped me. I called my brother to come pick me up and he did, driving me back home. My parents are letting me stay here rent free (I am still paying rent on the apartment with Jake since he won't let me leave the lease) but they've taken this opportunity to basically rub it in my face all along.

They talk constantly about how they knew he was terrible, how I could have just avoided this if I just listened to them, and what did I expect when I insisted on dating lovers. Everytime I try to tell them to stop they get incredibly passive aggressive. They say things like ""oh, don't contradict her, she'll just leave us again when you say something she doesn't like."" Or ""guess well just shut the fuck up and watch you get hit again because you're so stubborn.""

I refused to cook dinner for them last night and my brother said to my father ""she'll let a man slap her around and treat her like garbage but she won't cook food her sick mother who is paying for her college fund. This is why I'm never having kids. They're so ungrateful."" I feel trapped and alone.

Because of this, I am actually seeking for advice on where to get help. I believe it may require multiple sources for different aspects such as legal advice. Part of the issue is that even what I know is limited. Ultimately, my end goal is to ensure my mother's safety and sanity. My mother does confide in me and we want to make a plan to ensure her safety.

There is a company owned by both my mother and father in addition to several other assets. To exemplify one complexity of the situation; there have been odd and sketchy things done in the past such as the company president changing between both of my parents and even another woman who was my dad's girlfriend. (My parents never divorced for fear of giving all of their money to lawyers, which is still an aspect we hold strongly to in seeking advice). That woman is no longer in the picture but every now and again she may come back into the picture somehow. An example being, my father will send her money and not have a good explanation.

I personally believe that the simplest solution to everything is my mother treating my father with a very confident and strong mindset/attitude. I describe to my mother ways based on actual things that happened in our family where these sorts of tactics were successful. Unfortunately, this is very difficult for her. He bullies and manipulates her in many different ways such as telling her she's a bad mother or he will diagnose her with Borderline Personality Disorder. So I will suggest to her something like, be robotic to him. If he wants you to do something and he throws in the emotionally abusive aspect, you just say yes and do what needs to be done. No need to interact with him further. If you have to do work for your company do that and only that. Anything else he tries to throw into it that's unnecessary, you need to ignore and not get emotional. However, it's been a long time that I've had to accept she just cannot do that.

The most recent issue that has occurred between them is that he found out she was saving up some money and now he has gotten into what I would describe as his ""alerted"" state. He will likely prod and pry my mother for any and all information about her life. He will say anything to get her to do what he wants and he often does things like hang a carrot on a stick to try and get what he wants from her. For example, my sister is getting married soon so whenever he wants something, he will try and mention that in it to get whatever he wants.

I apologize that this is such a long and complex issue but it goes deeper. Is there any sort of place I can go to seek deep advice and maybe a plan for this? I want to make a plan to help protect her financially and mentally from him. I feel like I do not personally have the knowledge or wisdom to do this. I guess in a weird way I almost picture some sort of a team of help looking at this as like a heist to ensure my mom's security in different aspects of her life.

I fear she will react swiftly and emotionally and do something that will hurt herself in the long run. While my father frequently makes very poor financial decisions, he is smart when it comes to getting what he wants. I find that usually what he wants is just power over other people. I believe that in order to make a plan to protect my mom, it will need to be tactical and executed in a long controlled process.

Any help at all would be much appreciated. This is very difficult for me to post because it's quite personal and when I reread it over it feels so overwhelming that I just want to delete it.

Had to post this on a throwaway due to the specifics of the situation. IDK if this is the right place for this but idk where else to post this.

My mom and dad got split up when we were very young and got remarried when me and my sister were a few years older (I was about 10-12, she would've been 8-10). My step dad has a couple brothers and a few sisters. They would always come over for (step) family parties hosted at my house. We would BBQ, play yard games, have a lot of fun.

Me and my little sister have been through a lot over the years. We haven't really been close to each other until we got a bit older in recent years. My sister tells me some stuff, but doesn't really come to me for much. My sister talks to my gf a lot about life problems she doesn't tell me because she sees her as an older sister. My sister told my gf something and told her never to tell anyone about this, however, my gf told me because of the severity of the situation.  

My sister recently posted something on a private story (I cannot see her private stories, but my gf can) about sexual abuse and my gf was asking about it. Apparently there was someone who she trusted that sexually assaulted her. Me and my gf were wondering who it could be. My mind was racing about all the people who she trusts that could've done this. My gf asks about it and turns out it's my step dad's younger brother. I guess he would follow her around at parties and touch her breasts and grind on her while no one was looking. At the time she would've been 10. He would've been 16 or 17. One time I guess he picked her up and put my sister in his lap and she glanced through the window of our house and saw our step dad looking at them. He didn't do anything or say anything. Just seen it and looked away. (Perhaps he didn't know what was going on and didn't know what to think, idk). I guess at some point my sister told my mom and my mom told her that it was up to her if she wanted to get the police involved. My sister said no (my sister told my gf she didn't go to the police because she had a lot going on in life, my mom and step dad were either just married or were about to get married, there was a lot going on for her, idk). I never understood before why people who had experienced sexual assault wouldn't go to the police immediately and get the guy locked up ASAP but now I can somewhat understand that sometimes the situation is more complicated than that. \[Side note\] I recently started hanging out with this step uncle because I'm older now and we both smoke weed so we would bond over that. I cannot fucking believe that this guy can come hangout with me and look me in the face knowing what he did. I feel like my family is fucked and I've been living a lie as to my thoughts on my step family and even my mom. I'm pissed that my mom didn't make my sister go to the police. I'm pissed that my step dad might've seen the whole thing go down and he didn't say a word. I'm absolutely livid about my step uncle and that I've been hanging out with him.  Part of me wants to strangle him in his sleep. Idk what to do or how to feel about my family. I'm broken right now and any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks if you read this far.

edit: sorry if I seem all over the place, I'm still livid about the situation, schools been kicking my ass, and corona has put me in a really bad place mentally. I'm stressed out beyond belief. I've been having suicidal thoughts and this adds to it, but at the same time makes me want to live so I can protect my sister.",2020.0,4.0,24.0,08:36:36,victim,10

512,35,42,My (24F) husband (38M) keeps sexualising my childhood trauma even tho I’ve asked him not to. I’ve tried everything. Nothing is working. Thinking of divorce.,21389.0,gwdaw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gwdaw1/my_24f_husband_38m_keeps_sexualising_my_childhood/,3225.0,1591287676.0,"NSFW

Please don’t waste your time on the age gap. It’s something I’ve dealt with for our whole relationship and I don’t want to get lectured about it.

I’ve been with my husband for 6 years, married for 2. I know he’s older but he looks very youthful for his age and he’s super fit and active so honestly the age was never an issue, ever.

Between the ages of 10 and 15 I was sexually abused by my step dad and when I first started getting serious with my now husband, I told
Him everything. All the details, all the ways it screwed me up and all the horrible after math and fall out from various family members. In short, it was all bad, in every which way you can imagine. 

Within the last 4 months, every time my husband and I make love, it starts out normal but at some point he always starts asking questions about the times I was abused. He gets real graphic and bc were in the moment, I always answer his questions. 

I’m not a prude by any means and I even have my own kinks which he always enjoys. But lately it seems his only kink is hearing me talk about the most traumatic time in my life. The questions he asks are so gross and so personal and he’s never asked these before. The concerning part is he seems to get excited about the details as I answer his question bc he always finishes super fast once he starts asking these questions.

I’ve sat him down SEVERAL TIMES and told him how it makes me feel less than, how it hurts me, how it makes me feel like trash. How it brings me back to a horrible time. And I’ve told him to stop. He always apologizes about it and says he won’t do it anymore. But then we start making love and whether it’s 10 minutes, 20 minutes or one of our longer sessions, he always ends up bringing it up near the end of our session a few minutes before he finishes. 

I write this in my bed alone as I’ve asked him to sleep on the couch tonight bc he just did it again after I repeatedly tell him not to.  

I don’t know what my next move is. I’m tempted to leave but I don’t work and would have to take him to court to get some type of support so I can live and I know that stuff takes time. I still love him and he’s a great husband in every other sense but this whole thing is turning me off and slowly but surely making me fall out of love with him. If he really loved me why would he continually hurt me like this? Also, is it possible he is perverted like, liking that stuff? How is this new I’ve known him for years and he’s never mentioned this as being a turn on. Any advice would be appreciated, I have no family and friends here as I’m new to the city we live in and my family lives in a different country. 

Thank you.

EDIT: I was not expecting to get so many messages. Literally thousands. Thank you to everyone who is sending support. It’s impossible to message all of you so I just want you to know I’ve read hundreds of your comments and the support made me cry. Thank you x a million. I will post an update soon.

Need advice to get out 22F",2.0,fstpcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fstpcs/abusive_controlling_family_need_advice_to_get_out/,10.0,1585748776.0,"I apologize- I know there are many people who post about their controlling families, but I (22F) need advice on how to get out or how to manage this situation. I am terribly overwhelmed and my mental health is on the brink of collapsing.

I'm from a Christian, Korean (60 y/o mother)/White ( 62 y/o father) household. I am no longer Christian, and the values my mother and father have are VERY different from mine since they are more traditional.

She cares for me a lot and does a lot of things like fund my college tuition , does my laundry when I'm tired, and cooks me food when I'm there, but it is hard to get over the things she has done. 

When I was a child, (5y/o ~ 10 y/o approx.) she would often tell me she would take the gun my dad has and shoot us both to end our repetitive cycle of arguing. She would often run to the knife drawer and say she would cut herself, and most times I would have to block her. She would usually threaten to kick me out of the house, tell me to live with my grandmother in another city, and find my own way to go to school. When I became a teenager, she would tell me she would kick me out with no belongings if I didn't do what she said. If I protested, somehow it would lead her to threaten me by getting a divorce with my dad, because she knows I care for him greatly and seeing him upset tore me up inside. Then, when I started getting into self harm and she discovered me in the act, she challenged me to just do it and that I was harming myself to get back at her. And, now, she threatens to withdraw all her funding from me, even my school funding, if I do not do what she says. What usually made her angry and go to the extremes was when I didn't do my homework on time, didn't listen to her, or talked back. I never stayed out late, did drugs, or cause any major problems.

I do not get along with her. I resent her greatly for the trauma, depression, distrust, anxiety, and etc. that I have had to endure since childhood. However, in efforts to fix our relationship, I have talked to her and she has apologized. She says that her crazy actions were fake, and she said it was a form of ""shock therapy"" because I was such a stubborn kid. But despite my efforts to explain that it was real to me because I was young, she always pushes it off to the side. 

I really don't like coming home, yet they always guilt me into it. They always compare me to their other friends' children who come back every break from college. When I tell them I need space, they get offended and angry. When I'm at home I'm always very depressed, unmotivated, and uncomfortable, and when I don't interact with them, they get offended. When I try to be somewhere else, they always blackmail me with finances to stay with them. 

They are co-paying for my college, but when I am trying to get out they always say they will not give me any inheritance and they will take the stuff they bought me and stop paying for my school. 

Due to COVID, I have had to come back home. Recently, they have been giving me no personal space and have asked very personal questions about my boyfriend and I that make me very uncomfortable. They hate that I am intimate with him and call me ""gross"". Even when I lock the door because I dont want to talk to them, they use a Bobby pin to unlock it and come in anyway. 

To leave, I have to sneak out without causing a commotion, and I have to mentally prepare to lose everything. I want to leave so badly, but I don't know of any other way without being financially fucked. 

Would it be worth it to leave? Would it be more strategic to wait till after I have finished school (I have 1 more year left)? Is there any other way that I can leave while being more prepared?  

I've already had a major episode where I broke down crying and screaming due to anxiety. I feel so trapped and I don't know how to get out. Any advice is appreciated. 


TLDR; My parents and I have a really bad history of abusing me as a child. They get offended if I want to keep my distance by staying with other people over my breaks, and they financially blackmail me to stay. How do I get out without being financially fucked or how do I manage this situation before I have another mental breakdown?",2020.0,4.0,1.0,19:31:16,victim,22

I’m [25]M, live in the UK, and have been in self-isolation for a couple of weeks now. I live at the family home with my father, mother, and younger sister [19]. My mother and sister are both key workers and still work two days a week, and It is predicted that we will be on lockdown for at least another month (difficult to say really). 

My sister has not been able to see her boyfriend [26]M for around three weeks due to Covid-19 and has been pressuring us to allow him to come and live with us for the remaining duration of the quarantine. I find this idea very unappealing. My sister has been with her boyfriend for two years but has had many breakups with him, the most recent being around two months ago. During this time, my sister confided in us that her boyfriend had put his hands around her throat and threatened to kill her during an argument (amongst other abusive behaviours). Me, my father, and mother were understandably horrified. Unfortunately, despite our protests, they have recently got back together.

I have never been a big fan of my sister’s boyfriend. We have little in common and I have felt for a long time that she could do better, judging that he is not a decent person. Nevertheless, I have always been civil and tried to make an effort, understanding that she may be with him long-term and that her happiness is most important. Recent events have done little to improve my perception and if I’m honest may have even tarnished my opinion of him. 

Since getting back with him, my sister’s interpretation of events has changed. She says that whilst he did indeed behave in an abusive manner, it is less heinous than originally assumed as she has been almost as bad in her treatment of him. She maintains that he is a good person. I have seen him in passing since their reconciliation and have been civil (at her behest), but what she asks now is entirely different. I believe that him being here for potentially months will make my time here far less comfortable. As far as I’m concerned - the relationship has run its course. I believe they will inevitably break up again soon, and realistically, I do not think there is anything he could do to restore my respect for him. I have no desire to repair our relationship, and despise putting on an act. I do not see how him being here will be anything but awkward. 

My sister is lovely and we have a good relationship. As the days have passed she has become more upset over not seeing him, and has recently confided in my mother that she wants me to reconsider. I do not know what to do. My mother is willing to let him stay, and my father is on the fence. The main concern my father has is the transmission of the virus, however my mother and sister are key workers and her boyfriend has been isolated for over 7 days. I feel very selfish for causing her this unhappiness in order to avoid some personal awkwardness. I am aware that I could just grit my teeth, and she would be able to see her boyfriend. I have anxiety, and I fear that I am allowing my personal problems to negatively impact her life. She has said that her boyfriend understands the situation and will keep to himself to avoid things being uncomfortable. I find this unrealistic, and frankly, I find the thought of him staying here after his abusive behaviour to be an embarrassment. If he does not live here, she may be pushed to move back into his home and I am worried about her becoming isolated.

516,39,47,I [21F] am stuck at home with my emotionally abusive family due to coronavirus and feel myself getting close to a mental breakdown. What do?,4.0,flfupe,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/flfupe/i_21f_am_stuck_at_home_with_my_emotionally/,9.0,1584674212.0,"I am desperate.


Quick rundown, as not to bore you poor strangers with too much detail: 
my mother [49F] is immature, emotionally and verbally abusive, manipulative and gaslighting. She is very agressive which she explains with her short temper and my various therapists explain by her being an abuser.

My father [49F] explodes with huge anger once every few years, but most days stays neutral and when mom and I are arguing tells us both to be queit. He takes my mom’s side often not to cause more commotion and direct her anger towards himself.


Despite me going to an individual and group theraphy for 5 years now, taking meds for 4, having family theraphy sessions and 4 different specialists concluding separately that my mother is abusing me and my dad is enabling her, not much has changed.


I have diagnosed depression, anxiety and chronic stress, the last one linked specifically to my home situation. I developed psychosomatic back problems that cyropractor I was visiting linked in front of my mother to a long time trauma without knowing my psychological history.


We are middle class and before the covid outbreak (well, 4 years ago they started saying that this year they’d take care of it and so on and so on) they promised me to buy me an apartment (yeah, huge gift and I am grateful, but at this point various therapists told me they’ve hit a brick wall and I can only get better if I move out and am unable to get enough money due to my anxiety and studying colliding with work). Now that the world economy is in shambles my only hope, literally the only thing keeping me hopeful besides my wonderful boyfriend, may be gone. It would take years for me to save up to rent a room myself and due to anxiety and panic attacks I wouldn’t be the best roommate.


I live in a country with not much coronavirus cases, but which was quickly closed down. Every possible way of escaping my home is blocked- can’t go to uni (classes are cancelled), can’t go to my boyfriend’s (mom is paranoid I’ll catch the virus and threatens not to let me in when I’m back), can’t go to a caffe or even on a walk as my mom is in histeria due to the pandemia (she is one of those people that weeks ago bought out all of the toilet paper and rice so yeah). 
My theraphy is cancelled. My appointment with my psychiatrist is cancelled. I can only rely on a supply of medication.

I’ve been stuck at home with my parents and little sister [13] for almost 2 weeks and feel my sanity slowly going away. I cannot stop crying. I’m shaking. I can’t sleep. I’m constantly on edge. Mom keeps snapping at everyone for every little thing and gets defensive and passive-agressive (recent example: sat down with my parents and reminded them that we made a mutual agreement to quit yelling and that once told ’stop’ a person is supposed to leave the room and calm down as not to escalate. Mom broke this rule we all agreed on 3 times this week. When told that she snapped ’Well just crucify me then, I get it, I’m the worst mom, I want to just go outside and end it all’).
I try very hard to stay calm and mature, considering my little sister is starting to have similar symptoms to me and is taking this situation really hard.

But it’s getting impossible. Every day I get yelled at, gaslighted, dismissed. I feel myself going insane. I’m considering harming myself so they can lock me in a hospital away from my parents.
We have no close family, no one who could take me and my sister in. I can’t inconvenience my boyfriend’s family and stay with them, especially during covid outbreak.


Talking to them calmly doesn’t work. Ignoring the abuse doesn’t work. Defending myself doesn’t work. Taking the yelling quiet doesn’t work. 

I cry myself to sleep every day even though I barely sleep. I shake every time I hear my mom’s irritated voice even if she’s not talking to me. I’m shaking. I can’t stop crying. I feel like there is no hope. 

Dad won’t stand up to her, never did during my childhood. My mom can’t understand reason.  My sister is sensing the atmosphere and is getting more and more stressed. Also, my dog is sick.


I don’t want to call any CPS-like services in my country. It would end this family. They would never forgive me. If I go to some kind of shelter or even a hotel my mom won’t let me back until the outbreak is over in a few months and I don’t have enough money and, hell, groceries and supplies to survive quarantine on my own.


I find myself wishing for harm, for mental breakdown so someone takes me away. I keep staying strong for my little sister and my boyfriend (who is worried sick), but I don’t know how long I can go on. It’s been 2 weeks. Months are to come. I think I might not survive it mentally and literally.


Is there anything you think I can do? Did I overlook an option? Or do I take it day by day and get the hell out as soon as everything goes back to normal?

I (23MtF trans) used to live on my own, with a successful job, but in mid June of last year my lease was abruptly nullified by the landlord losing an eminent domain lawsuit. I had to move out quickly and give up my job and move back home. Things have been rocky since then, because I went from a big city where jobs were plentiful and I was accepted to a rural bedroom community full of conservatives where I get glared at everywhere I go. My mom (51F) is generally accepting of my life choices, but there's severe friction between us because she withholds any sort of spending money or even cell phone service and tells me to ""just get a job.""

My brother (15M) is very obstinate and aggressive. He'll respond to any sort of attempt at parenting or giving directions with ""No, fuck you."" It does not help that my mother is terminally ill and is unable to parent him like she should, so he just does whatever he wants.  I had been getting along with him ok until COVID-19 locked us all inside together all the time. He would then stay up all night shouting into his mic on discord with his friends and keeping me and mom awake. We were unable to get him to go to bed by any means.

One night I had enough of his 3:30 am shouting and this is where the trouble started. I went into his room (he leaves his doors open) and attempted to disconnect his microphone. We grappled a bit, I slapped his shoulder, he kicked me, etc. He took off out of the house somewhere in the middle of the night and called the police on me. The whole thing left a really sour taste in my mouth because of what I'd done, but I tried to carry on in the hopes I could make that incident be a one time thing.

I lost my cool again last night. He brought a can of tuna upstairs to eat and left the mostly empty can in the open air bathroom trashcan. I threw it into his room and said ""DON'T EAT UPSTAIRS!"" and then we took the argument downstairs. It escalated, and then I ended up throwing a pillow at his face. It might not have been destructive, but I still got violent, he threatened to call the cops again, and we seperated. This morning I found that he had moved all his stuff upstairs to the attic bedroom as if he's hiding from me. Mom is acting super protective of him and refuses to let me speak to him.

I feel like I am becoming the family boogeyman. The abusive relative that people speak in hushed tones about at reunions. I want to nip it in the bud and get back to life before I got so damn angry for no good reason, but with everything including therapists and support groups closed these days, I just don't know what to do!

How should I patch things up? Can I patch things up?

Hi all,

Today is my boyfriend's birthday! Kind of shitty it's in the middle of a quarantine but it's time to celebrate regardless! But not in the eyes of his family!

I live with my boyfriend over the summer when I'm home from school. We get along great, he's the love of my life, have been best friends for 12 years and dating for 6.

My boyfriend (let's call him D) is an engineer and is working at a commissioning position essentially building a new building for work. It's a construction site, it's really difficult to stay 6 feet apart, difficult to not cross contaminate, etc. Because of this, my boyfriend doesn't feel comfortable going to see his folks at their house because they're older and his dad has high blood pressure and is probably diabetic, if not pre-diabetic. He's worried for their safety.

Even though he explained this to them, his dad texts him saying, ""D, you’re a bit nutty just wanted to have cake and give you a present. Forget about it. Why do we even try? Enjoy"". His little brother, who lives with his parents, called D for not coming over, screaming at him, calling D an asshole and sent a text saying how D is an asshole and needs to treat his family with respect.

This isn't an isolated incident, I feel like this happens every birthday or big family event I've been apart of since we've started dating. I feel helpless because I want to do something to fix it, but I know it's not my place. This past summer when I moved back home, his brother moved in to help w bills and stuff.

521,44,56,My (21F) mom was very abusive to me but not with my brothers. Right now I'm not sure if I should cut them all out of my family,1.0,g4whjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g4whjp/my_21f_mom_was_very_abusive_to_me_but_not_with_my/,1.0,1587430512.0,"This is a weird situation. Let's start by saying that currently I don't talk to my mom. She always had this strategy of not talking to me when I was mad so I would go behind here doing whatever she wanted just to I would be able to talk to her. At some point I stopped caring and I don't know how it happened but she hasn't talked to me since the age of 15.

But before when she talked to me sometimes and out of the blue without context she would come to me and say things like ""you're so fat. now I may seem fat, but that's because I'm +40 (whatever her age was). But when I was your age I was so skinny, by the time you reach your forties you'll be obese"" And like comments about how she was way more pretty than me and comparing herself to me. And also sometimes she would just attack me saying that I was too fat and that I my stomach looked like a pig and sometimes she would sing a melody calling me names. And yes she was abusive and then would make fun of how she would beat me with my brothers. 
All of this went in till the age of 15. 

My father was abusive but with everyone, not only me. And I have to recognize that I was very disrespectful sometimes. I'm pretty sure he has angry issues. But unlike my mother he beat all of us, not just me. And he would feel guilty afterwards and buy us whatever we wanted. So I do get that that's no way of treating kids but I feel like he couldn't help it because of mental health issues. 

But some weird thing he did: he compared me to my mom. Okay not comparing . But for example once he asked my mom to go get cash from the bank. My mom didn't want to. So he said that he was going to erase her from the bank account and put me instead. And if I cooked something and my mom a few days after did the same he would tell her that what I did was way better. And if my mom didn't want to go with her someplace he would say something like I should go instead and that he prefers my company. That made me distance myself of my father. To avoid awkward situations from both of them. 
Its like he knows the relationship between my and my mom and tries to use that against her. I don't know. 

And by the way my parents are Muslims. But I guess we would call them ""cultural Muslims""  which means that we only to the Ramadan and anything else. They do pray but they never taught us how to pray. So we don't really practice the religion itself. But it's a problem because my mom cares a lot about her image in front of other immigrant Muslims. And for her having a girl leaving without getting married would be a shame. That's why I still live with them. If I had to leave I would probably go to another country to be safe. I can't just move to another house in the same city. 

She has said that she would rather see me die that leaving and shaming the whole family. Sometimes she said that maybe she should kill me and that would be less shame than me leaving or getting pregnant or whatever (she assumes that I'm a slut and I will probably get pregnant before marriage). 

I don't know the relationship is very complicated with my parents. The only person I get along with is my brother. But I resent him because he has a very good relationship with my mom. It's a bit childish I know. I've tried asking for advice in the exmuslims subredit (I've talked about the last part, how difficult is for me to move because of my mom) and all I got is people trying to convince me how all the bad things happening in my life is because of islam instead of getting any advice. And I've already said that we don't even practice. So I wanted to try asking for help/advice here and explaining a bit more the situation.  

How to deal with this type of parents? I know it's easy thinking that because we don't talk there is no problem between me and my mom. But I'm always hearing comments about me that she says to my little brothers and it's clear at this point she's trying to out then against me. I wouldn't like to lose my relationship with them. But I'm not sure how. I would love to hear about people who had a similar history of abuse but they where the only ones abused. I want to keep my relationship with my brothers but at the same time I'm not sure if my resentment will allow me to. 

TL;DR My mom was abusive and used to compare always myself to me (example ""you're too fat at your age I was so pretty and you're so ugly, etc) we haven't talked since I was 15. And when I move out I'll probably will have to go to another country. I don't know if it will be possible keeping a relationship with my brothers once I cut out my mother. And I don't know if the resentment will allow me (I was the only one abused)",2020.0,4.0,21.0,06:40:12,victim,15

At first things were okay..she was guilting me for leaving (like saying how my mom wasn’t eating and my dad is on depression pills).  Things turned for the worst when I mentioned I had a white boyfriend who wasn’t Muslim. She started to attack me and say how selfish I was for leaving the family for a man. How my parents weren’t abusive and I’m acting like a victim.

She sent an apology and then she was asking when I’m getting married or if I’m pregnant. In my culture people get married within a year. She told me if I wanted to see my younger siblings again I should lie to my parents and say my BF is Muslim and he should pretend. She said once we get married (we would have an Islamic wedding) we move away and live our lives the way we want to. My boyfriend and his family are strong Christians and he refused. To top it all off I left Islam and I converted Christianity (I wanted to for years) and I can only imagine what her reaction would be...

We've been rooming together for years. She has a very abusive family, every abuse under the sun, but since moving away to college, the only way they have left to control her is financially. They won't let her have her own account - she has a joint account with her family (literally every member has access to it, aunts uncles grandparents etc), so even though she works 2 jobs and goes to school, they'll withdraw money and spend it on whatever they want. As abuse goes, she makes excuses for them, saying ""They're my family, they probably need it more than me anyway."" She then ends up having to beg her family for money to pay rent. They eventually do, but always tell her she ""owes them"" later. Their agreement now is, when she graduates next year, every cent she makes working professionally must go back to them, then they'll send a portion back for her like an allowance.

Obviously, she can't ""just leave"" her family. I've tried to take her to the bank to open her own account over the years, but that always brings on a panic attack for her - she's afraid her family will find out she's keeping her money (bc of course it won't be deposited in that shared account) and they'll excommunicate her. They have threatened this. She cares about her family and doesn't want this to happen.

Recently things have gotten worse-- they won't send her the money back to pay rent until it's too late to make payments. So this year I've had to cover rent for her and wait for her to pay me back. We live in California so rent is $700 each, plus internet and electricity. 

I understand her situation, I myself have had this but with a boyfriend of 6 years, so I said of course. She's been able to pay me back rent money, but again it's later and later, and sometimes only portions. 

At this point, she now owes me over a thousand dollars in late utilities and portions of rent payments. I feel very guilty whenever I ask her to repay me, because I know it's not that simple. And I know the saying, ""Don't lend more than you're willing to lose,"" but we need to pay rent. If I put my foot down and refuse to cover her half, rent won't get paid, and we'll be evicted.

I've brought up the idea of her taking out student loans, but she refuses, saying ""I already owe my family so much, I can't afford to pay off loans later too.""

My mom, dad, and sister are manipulative and lie to me and spread rumors.

When I was a child, I struggled with severe depression and they were all convinced it was all for attention. They laughed at me and I was punished for showing emotion so I learned to cry silently in the bathroom. A lot of my memories of my childhood are blurry and I am really unsure about it.

The only solid memories I have are things they have said and done to me. Like, when I was suicidal at 13, I
told the school and they made my mom take me to a doctor. She was pissed at the obligation and told me that she was mad that she had to take time away from work to take me to a doctor. Several times throughout my childhood, my mom would take me to a psychiatrist and then never return for follow-up appointments or med refills. Eventually she just stopped taking me and told me to grow up. 

But some recent stuff they have done to me is:

My sister and mom shouting at me when I skipped family gatherings due to poor mental health.

My parents and exhusband working together to schedule my daughters baptism and a dinner party afterward. I was never told about it. They insist that they told me and I “forgot”. 

My mom arguing with my husband for weeks and then eventually full on arguing that we should keep our old car instead of buy a new one. 

My sister telling my new boyfriend (now husband of 10 years) that I slept with random men in my previous relationship.

My sister telling a group of people at a BBQ that I had gone into the psych hospital for attention and I didn’t deserve to have visitors because it was my fault that I was there.

When I was finally diagnosed with bipolar at 29, my sister told me “Just remember to not shove it in people’s faces and don’t expect special treatment.” My mom said “Whatever makes you happy.”

My mom barging into my room when I was severely depressed in bed, tearing my blankets off and demanding I get out of my and grow up. She told me that my kids should go live with their father and my husband should leave me. When I tried explaining that I was mentally ill, she accused me of telling my doctors that she abused me. 

My mom was behind on her bills. She tried to persuade us (me, husband, 3 kids) to move into her guest room and pay her $1000 a month. She pushed that it would be a good choice for my family. I grew sick over it but eventually told her no. We offered for her to move into our guest room, rent free. We offered to help her pay a bill. She refused. She told family and neighbors that she offered us the whole house for $800/month and we refused.

My mom still reprimands me like I’m a child. Every life decision I make is out of fear that they will be mad at me for making the wrong choice.

Every time my mom walks into my house, she looks around and finds one thing that is messy or out of place and she comments how “bad” I am. 

There is honestly so much more. 

But in October of 2019, I was talking to a therapist and she opened my eyes to how my family treats me. So I just fell off the map basically, and stopped talking to all of them.

Well, they live next door. (Haha.....)

So slowly I have found myself warming back up to them and everything seems innocent right now. But I know that it’s just a matter of time before they cause drama.

I'd had my character faults in the beginning just as he had his, but as time went on and we got older, I began to grow and mature into a better human being. A major motivator was having to maintain composure and remain present and alert as his behavior became more agressive, every night, for hours. When I'd try to leave, he would get violent to the point of him leaving bruises on me and even pulling a knife on me. A year after I finally broke off from him, I cut him off completely. I moved out of state, moved jobs, deleted social media, changed phone numbers, and deleted the email of mine that he had.

Fast forward a year and a half to yesterday when I received a text from my sister asking about him. I called her as soon as I could and apparently after midnight the night before, a man had started banging on the window and screaming at her. She ended up screaming and running away to grab my parents and call the cops and was unable to make out the specific voice. The cops searched the neighborhood with lights and couldn't find anyone, so unless another incident occurs, we're stuck feeling vulnerable to another incident. The reason I bring up my ex and assume it's him is because he's the only one our family has had any problems with, and my sister is currently living in the room I was living in when we were together.

I'm scared for my family. I'm not in danger up here, but he knows where they live, has a consistent history of violence, and is compulsively obsessive about things. It's been a year and a half, so it feels ridiculous to suggest that it's him, but if it's not him, then it was a stranger, which makes even less sense.

There are so many stories of abusive men escalating in violence until they end up killing someone, and I'm worried that he might. There's nothing the police can do and there's no evidence that it was anyone. It could have been a disembodied voice for all we know. But in the case that it was him, is there anything at all my family can do to keep themselves safe in the off chance that there's another incident?

Tldr; Sister woke up to a man screaming and banging on her bedroom window. It was probably my abusive ex. Is there anything my family can do to limit danger in the case of another incident?",2020.0,4.0,3.0,15:27:01,victim,

Ever since I was a young girl, my brother has always been somewhat of a trouble maker. When me and my other brother (24m) were younger, my oldest brother would be extremely rough to the point in which we would get hurt or cry so hard that he would smother our faces with pillows so our parents wouldn’t hear us crying. 

My dad is somewhat aggressive too, which is where I think my brother developed this behavior. 

When my brother was in high school, he stopped hurting us but began getting in a lot of trouble with the law (ex. Vandalism, drugs, & a couple hit and runs) (we lived in a nice neighborhood/town so this activity was kinda rare for the city). Once he got to college, everything mellowed out and he became an amazing student and has an amazing career path ahead of him. 

But now, I have started to notice the aggressive behavior coming back. He is going to get married soon and I believe that he may be aggressive towards her and other people in his life. Here are all the instances that have worried me/I have walked into at the end of the conflicts: 

1. Last summer, I heard arguing outside my house so I went out into the front yard and I saw that his fiancé was trying to get away from him. He was grabbing onto her arm REALLY hard and was pulling her towards him, not letting her walk away from the argument. I yelled at him to stop and he did. I then asked his fiancé if she as okay and she said yes, so that was the end of it.

2. My brother and my mom had been disagreeing about something and my brother grabbed my moms face and squeezed her cheeks so her lips were pushed together. My mom has never had anyone touch her like that (that I know of), so she defended herself by pushing him off. (She still talks about how aggressive he was and how it concerns her.)

3. Today, my niece was visiting and my brother was playing with her downstairs. My mom and I were upstairs doing laundry. I heard my niece scream and it scared me so I ran down to see if she was okay. I didn’t see her. My front door was wide open, I checked outside and no one was there. I checked the garage and my brother was standing in the garage talking on the phone. My niece was crying next to my neighbors house. I asked her what happened and she said that my brother had slammed the door on her arm. I asked if it was an accident and she said that it was on purpose. I am unsure of the circumstances but when I asked my brother about it, he didn’t deny that it was an accident. He just ignored me and started talking to my niece (which I think is him manipulating her, since he used to do that to me and my other brother). We went inside and my older brother tried to make it up to her by making her lunch and giving her a popsicle. (This behavior and manipulation through food rewards, is all too familiar for me. He used to do this exact thing to me when I was little.) 

I talked to my mom upstairs after this all went down and we both think that my brother might have a problem with aggression. We are not quite sure what to do bc if we try to talk to him, he might just get mad. We don’t really know his fiancé too well either, so we don’t really know how to ask her either. 

Has anyone dealt with aggressive/abusive family members? How do we handle it? And where should I go from here? because I haven’t seen the aggressive behavior towards other people. I just know my own experiences with him when I was younger.

I am not emtionally prepared for talking with them.

Note: I feel like I'm venting so you might just want to read the Tdlr. 

My parents are divorced and I live with my mom only seeing my dad twice a month. I am practically my Mom's therapist, everyday when I come home I listen to her about her problems, some of which really shouldn't be talked about with your kid. For example when she was dating this dude I had to give her advice on how to manage a ghosting situation. Due to this I never talk to her about my problems or with anything that's going on in my life. If I do the conversation is directed to her. I hate going home because of this. 

On the other hand my dad is worse. There is so much to say about him. For one, everytime I have to go to his house I cry and sometimes feel suicidal. He doesn't believe in doctors and he believes he can cure my eczema with some diet. Tells me I should stop taking my meds(which work).

Then there's my brother, the perfect child. Played football, basketball, even sang and we amazing at it. My dad always compares me to him. Every mistake was highlighted because my brother could do it. Due to him 5 years older and having to do sports or homework for AP classes we aren't close. 
 
 By this point I'm assuming you're thinking why don't you tell CPS or school counselor? I'm afraid. I'm afraid of my mom telling me how I'm suppose to feel. I'm afraid of having to deal with my dad guilt trapping me because I don't love him. I don't think I can manage that. If my Mom knows I a feel I'm afraid everyday I come home she will look at me and think ""why isn't her brother?""

  
Usually I can manage, I only have to deal with my mom for a few hours a day, my dad once a month if I'm lucky. But due to the coronavirus shutting down schools I am stuck in the house with her 24/7. I had to call a crisis hotline because I was seriously considering trying to overdose on pills. I try to get out of the house as much as possible but I'm cracking. 

So what do I do? Do I contact cps or something or should I push through it. If the latter I really, really need tips for that.",2020.0,3.0,16.0,15:58:40,victim,24

Edit: the mom was told that I’m undetectable and what that means, but she’s too overwhelmed with fear to really listen and comprehend. 

For the last two months, my(28f) boyfriend (28m) have been staying with his mom during quarantine. I have my own home with roommates and so does he but she insisted we stay with her temporarily to more easily adhere to social distancing.

I am HIV positive, and my boyfriend is aware. My boyfriend is HIV negative. I’m undetectable, which means there is so little amount of virus in my body that I cannot transmit the virus to anyone else. I cannot infect another person, even through unprotected sex. If you aren’t aware of how this happens, people with HIV can take antiretrovirals to basically fight the virus and protect your white blood cells from being attacked so the virus is unable to replicate. A lot has changed over the decades.

A little background: I have been HIV positive since I was 15 years old. I have a lot of trauma associated with my status. The person who gave it to me was an adult who was extremely abusive. This person beat and raped me regularly and held my HIV status over my head as a way to control me and keep me in the relationship. For years, I felt unlovable and dirty. It took A LOT of work and therapy to overcome my own personal shame towards my status. I don’t tell anybody about my status unless they have to know – like they’re medical professionals or if I’m sleeping with someone. My family knows, but none of my friends do. Not even my closest ones. I was so afraid of the stigma of my status that it changed the trajectory of my entire life. I was suicidal for years and stayed in lots of bad relationships because I was worried nobody better would love me. I’m doing better now. I’m in a healthy, happy relationship with my boyfriend. I’m back in school, working on my career. I’m stable and independent. I’m turning my life around I’m doing a good job at it.

Well, my boyfriend’s mom found my medication. I had a pill bottle in my purse in the closet. She claims she found a pill on the floor and saw a bag sticking out of my purse and thought she would put it there. The medication was in the bag and that’s how she found it.

If I’m honest, I don’t buy her story. My medication is extremely expensive and I’ve always had dogs so I’ve always paid close attention to making sure I don’t drop any pills or leave them around. After a decade of taking medication every day, I know to pay close attention to how I get the pills out of my bottle. I never just pour them out into my hand. Even if I did actually drop a pill, I would think the normal reaction would be to set it aside on a counter or bring it directly to one of us, not go into my purse. Either way, she went through my purse and it feels like a huge invasion of privacy. I’m not sure what she was even doing in the closet to begin with. I really think she was just snooping.

Anyways, instead of coming to me or my boyfriend, she told his sister. And then his sister told her husband and their other sister. Now the whole family knows my HIV status. The mom apparently reacted with things like, “How could she do this to herself?” and “Was she not raised properly?” She’s always been judgmental towards me, but this is victim blaming at its finest. She was worried that I gave it to her son but he took a test in front of them and he is negative. His sisters are apparently not judging me for it, but his mom definitely thinks lesser of me. 

I’m so angry that I’m being judged for something that I didn’t do to myself, especially since I’ve handled it responsibly. I’m angry that she went through my stuff. I’m angry that they spread my private medical information through the whole family. There is so much trauma associated with my status and I feel like I like the control of this information has been taken from me.

His mom is divorced and I understand that she was scared for her son and didn’t have someone to talk to about it and that’s why she spoke with the sister, but she should have gone to my boyfriend directly. His mom was a nurse so she should know better than to spread people’s private medical information around. His sister also had no reason to tell the other sister. This my private medical information. My medical history and our sex life is none of their business.

As soon as I learned what she did, I packed my things and left without saying a word to her. I love my boyfriend and according to him, he stood up for me when talking to his mom and sister, but I don’t know what to do from here. His family is EXTREMELY close. They all talk every day and spend a lot of time together.  I don’t want to see them, but I’m going to have to at some point. And I don’t want to feel like I’m the “girlfriend with HIV” forever. 

I feel sick to my stomach and I’ve been crying every day. What do I do? What should I expect from my bf?

530,53,91,My mom (37f) thinks I (14f) blame her for my brutal beating.,1339.0,gqeppt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gqeppt/my_mom_37f_thinks_i_14f_blame_her_for_my_brutal/,184.0,1590454963.0,"First-time poster. Sorry if I make any mistakes. I'm going to try to keep this as short as I can.

When I was about 5 or 6, I was severely beaten. I say ""about"" because I have no memory of the event. I only know it happened because a few months ago, I found photos of myself hidden at my grandma's house. The photos were very hard to look at. I think they avoided my face, but the entire rest of my body was covered in big ugly bruises. When I confronted my grandma with the pictures, all she said was I came back from my mom's house (my parents are divorced) looking like that and the photos were evidence if it happened again. I'm at my mom's house now and yesterday I told her about the pictures I found. I DIDN'T ACCUSE HER. I only repeated what my grandma told me and asked my mom if she knew what happened. But my mom got really angry at me and said if I believed she did that, she would no longer be my mom. Then she called my dad (I didn't hear what was said) and hasn't spoken to me since.

I guess I want to know if I should keep trying to find out what happened? Or if it's better I don't know. Everyone else seems okay forgetting it happened, maybe I should be too.

Edit: Thank you all for the advice and helpful comments. I read and appreciate them all, though there were some common questions.

My mom did have custody at the time. My dad got custody of me a couple years later. Like I said, I don't remember the event, but I remember almost nothing from before age 8. I thought this was normal but I guess not? If any other abuse that severe happened, I can't remember it either. And yes, it was 100% me in the photos. My dad's mom took them and she took them back from me when I confronted her. I am sure I will never be able to find them again. It could be either of them, I guess. I just didn't want to believe it was my mom despite her reaction because she's actually a pretty good mom otherwise.

I will take your advice to talk to a counselor. I don't trust anyone to tell me the truth now. Maybe I can try talking to my dad later. I will update if I find anything out.",2020.0,5.0,26.0,06:47:43,victim,

It’s immature of me to expect our marriage to be all  jokes and vibing. But it makes my stomach hurt when things get  intense. I don’t want to say obsessive. But he can be too much sometimes.

At first, I was feeling suffocated in quarantine with him. I talked to him about it and it actually went really well. He’s always in the gym and I don’t work out lol, but that’s one way we agreed spend time apart.

Yesterday he asked if I could be in the gym with him while he worked out, to cheer him on. I said no. He said please and I told him he promised that we have our own spaces.  He said “I’m sorry, I’ll buy you a bag”, which was an inside joke between us. But it made me snap.

I just got so tight out of nowhere and told him that I don’t even like purses. He said “even the birkins”, I said especially the birkins and gave my reasons. So he went upstairs. 

I went up to go follow him after I cooled down and he was in a closet trying to cut an Hermes bag. The other one was already kinda fucked up. He was smiling, and calm like he did me a favour. I was so shocked.

He didn’t understand why I was bothered if I never liked it in the first place. He said that anything I don’t like is gone. He wants me to always get what I want. He’s not upset about what I said. That it’s okay for me to not like shit, especially if it’s things I never asked for. I told him it’s too much, that we could have donated it or auctioned it for charity or something. We’re just throwing away things of value.

He said “If you tell me you don’t like the kitchen right now. I’ll get a wrecking ball to it tonight and build a new one.” Then he switched back and started asking what we should do bc our 20th birthdays will be in lockdown. Started joking about celebrating not being in a teen marriage anymore. That was the scariest part. Like nothing happened. I entertained to because I wish it didn’t.

Scary, but I never feel unsafe and he would never ever hurt me. He’s never even insulted me outside of roasting each other for bants. I just don’t know what to do going forward. Maybe it’s all because he doesn’t get to show emotion, so they get bottled up inside and come out super intense.

Edit: I think I wanna go home, just to think at least. But I can’t because I don’t want to violate quarantine and put people at risk.

Edit: hey guys, just wanted to say that I’m reading and appreciating the comments. It’s just a lot to take in and absorb. So even though I don’t reply, I’m reading and it matters. I’m just overwhelmed.

Edit: Once again I want to thank everyone for taking the time to help me right now. I went to be with my family and I’m isolating for everyone’s health. I didn’t pack anything or tell him I was leaving. For the first time in a very long time, I feel like I’m breathing. Which says a lot haha. It’s not that I’m blind but saying the “A” word was scary. As stupid as it sounds, I also didn’t want my friends or family to be right. I have so much to think about. Just wanted you all to know I’m safe and listening even though I didn’t show it at first. I’m also sincerely sorry to anyone who might have had bad memories because of my post and responses. That was never my intention, I was just overwhelmed. Thank you again. I know people are wondering about the bags, he never bought them for me. His dad gifted them. They were set aside a long time ago.",2020.0,4.0,26.0,00:14:25,victim,95
532,55,108,My sister (21F) called me a “Karen” and said she will never forgive me (18M) for reporting my dads assault on me,292.0,gw6jg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gw6jg6/my_sister_21f_called_me_a_karen_and_said_she_will/,54.0,1591259731.0,"This happened today and I’m still very shaken up by it. I was at my dads house picking up some stuff when an argument occurred about my mom. 

Some background, my parents are divorced and not very friendly with each other. There is a court order not Allowing them to talk about each other in a bad light, or show any thing about the court to my younger sisters who are all minors. 
I was also kicked out of my dads house, where my younger sisters still live at, the day I turned 18. 

So he was showing my little sisters a private conversation between him and my mother, which by court order, he is not allowed to do. I mentioned this and told him he should keep that conversation private.
He got angry and eventually led to him yelling at me to leave his house, which I immediately did after grabbing my stuff. As I was walking out the front door, while still yelling at me. He shoved me into the concrete and slammed the door behind me. 
This isn’t the first time things like that has happened but I was extremely sick of it. I punched the door and cursed at him. Dating is this really what you want to teach your kids is ok?
Well, my mistake. That caused him to throw the door back open and throw me to the ground again. I wanted to punch him, he deserved it. But I didn’t. I just got up, and he threw me down to the ground again, but this time by my neck, leaving a large cut and red mark from his finger nails. 
After that I was able to stand up and leave. Then I sat in a parking lot and cried. I was scared to go to the police because I didn’t want my dad to do anything to my sisters as repercussion, or for them to potentially be negatively effected as a result. But in the end I decided it was the best course of action, so I talked to the police, and didn’t press charges, but did go to the courts and file for an ex partè. It got denied but is going to court later this month.
Well after this I called my older sister, Who also went through similar things like this from my dad, and who has always been there for me. But when I told her what happened and that I brought it to the police, she got furious with me. And told me that I just signed my sisters into the foster care system. 
She told me I was acting like a Karen, and that I was in the wrong for going to the police. 
This isn’t the first time he has attacked me like that. And she knew that, but seemingly didn’t care. 
I’m rethinking everything now. And I don’t know how I’m supposed to handle losing both my dad and probably my sisters who live with him, but also my older sister. 
I don’t know what I should do. Or if I shouldn’t have done what I did in the first place. 

TLDR; I got assaulted by my dad while leaving his house and reported it to the police and filed an ex partè. My sisters response to this was calling me a Karen and saying that she will never forgive me for going to the police.",2020.0,6.0,4.0,14:20:31,victim,18

One night I woke up to find him with his hand down my underwear. At the time I didn't know how bad this was so I didn't say anything. This went on for several years and after I learned about it being inappropriate for him to do that I told him to stop.

He ended up threatening to do the same to my newborn sister if I resisted. When I was 8 he moved out and I haven't told anyone about what he did.

Yesterday I found his Facebook page and he posted something about him getting married and how his fiance has a beautiful little girl. I immediately started freaking out since im the only one who knows what he did.

Im scared for both the mother and daughters safety but I don't have any way to prove what he did. I don't know what to do.

Once a week or so I video call with her and my mom to catch up with each other, and my sister is often sharing plans that she has for the wedding. Other than some petty arguments, we get along fine, and I was honestly looking forward to the event.

That is, until a few days ago, when she informed me that she was going to be inviting our dad to the wedding. Our parents split up when we were both pretty young, my sister living with mom and me living with dad. 

Without going into too much detail, living with my dad was hell. He was a drunk who sexually abused me when I was a small child. I haven’t had contact with him for years. My mom and sister both know the vague outline of why I don’t talk to him, but he and my sister still have a good relationship despite having only physically met each other a few times since our parents split up. She sees him as a good man, and doesn’t seem to believe what I’ve said about him.

So, she was excited by the concept of meeting him in person and having him at her wedding. I was kind of shocked and told her bluntly that if he was going to be there, I wouldn’t be. She was very upset by this and said that she shouldn’t have to choose between her brother and her father and that I was going to ruin her special day.

I stuck with my statement and told her I wasn’t going to be in the same room as the man who raped me. She responded to this by denying that he would ever do something like that, but then quickly followed it up by telling me that I’m ‘just bitter because it made me gay’, and it can’t have been *that* bad and I need to grow up and get over it.

I hung up on her and since then we haven’t spoken. My mom seems to be deliberately not picking sides and I’ve been losing sleep wondering whether what I said was a dick move or not to make my sister blow up like that. It feels weird posting this online, but it’s the only place I can think of to get an outsider’s perspective.

How do I express to her, kindly, that my statement still stands and if she invites him I won’t be attending, without it seeming like it’s an attack against her or just being stubborn? I know this is a vague request, but I really have no idea how to go about bringing it up again.

Edit. Thank you all for your feedback. I think I’ve decided I won’t be going to her wedding and I’m probably going to be distancing myself from her in general.",2020.0,5.0,24.0,19:47:12,victim,21
535,58,121,My parents(46F/49M) have gotten into another fight and now my mother is telling me(17/M) and my little siblings(14M/12F) that she's going to kill herself. I don't know what to do.,227.0,gkpgjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gkpgjg/my_parents46f49m_have_gotten_into_another_fight/,52.0,1589636500.0,"I've never really written out a situation like this before so I'm sorry if it's confusing.

Our parents have been fighting all week. My mom's been shut in her room refusing to talk to my dad and my dad doesn't want to talk to her at all either. It all started Mother's Day when my mom got mad we didn't make her breakfast in bed so she locked herself in her room all day and wouldn't let us give her the presents we had gotten her. Later in the evening when we tried a second time we kinda got rejected with a ""Breakfast in bed would've been nice but thanks I guess"" and she barely even looked at them. I'm not gonna lie that pissed me off because my little brother and sister had specifically asked me to drive them to the store so we could get her things and even helped color and write a custom card. So I was mad to see them shut down like that and so was my dad. 

Fast forward a few days later, it was my birthday, and she was still shut in her room. The only time I saw her that day was when I had gotten back from a walk and was sitting on my front porch, and she walked by me and got in the car and left. I went inside to see she'd set up a cake and tablecloth for me, and put flags with funny pictures printed onto them into the cake and I thought that was pretty awesome. I texted to say thanks but didn't get a response. My dad got home from work with pizza at like 5 and was really mad she hadn't come out of her room on my birthday. My mom was mad at him that I didn't have any presents or surprises or anything so basically both of my parents blamed the other for ""ruining"" my birthday(Which I didn't even expect or want to be anything special in the first place given the state of the world. There were circumstances and I understood that). 

The next day was their wedding anniversary and they had drinks on the back porch and everything seemed to be going well until my sister came out to go to the swing and from what I heard got grilled by my mom about ""chores"" she apparently hadn't done. According to my dad, my sister's face just dropped and she turned around and went back inside. Again, I wasn't there but from what I was told my dad didn't get mad at my mom or anything about it he just said he wished she hadn't been made to feel bad because she had been pretty proud of what she HAD done that day. So then this might have led to an argument because we heard my mom say ""Thanks for ruining my whole fucking night"" and went to her room again. 

My parents haven't spoken a single word to each other since unless it was shouting matches. They had two that have pretty much led us to where we are today. I was asleep when they both happened but I know at one point my dad had told her to just go because my mom had apparently been talking about leaving. But yeah that pretty much brings us to yesterday where my mom legit disappeared all day. I woke up to a long text from her which was pretty much a goodbye note where she said I was a great kid and said a lot of nice things to me, and even said she loved me which she's only said to me once before(coincidentally also when she and my dad were fighting). My brother and sister got similar messages and she was nowhere to be found, car gone. I know this might be snooping but I got on her facebook to see if she'd been talking to my grandmother or anyone about going anywhere, but all I saw were some very angry messages she sent to my dad, and in the messages were stuff like ""I'll just stay up here till I die, which is hopefully soon."" So at this point I'm pretty concerned so I call my grandmother to see if she'd talked to her at all, and she'd been told by my mom that she was going to a park to walk. She normally goes to this park by our house so I walked there to look but she wasn't there. My car is in the shop right now so I couldn't drive around to look so I pretty much spent the whole day trying to track her down and was gonna call the cops before she finally came home at like 11 PM that night. 

Then she starts texting me about how my grandmother told her we all wanted her to come home and how that had ""saved her life"" but she could see it ""wasn't true"". We text some more and she's saying all this stuff about how she's been so depressed and my dad doesn't care and she's suicidal and stuff. And I didn't know what to say to that so I was just trying to calm her down I guess. Saying its a hard time and we gotta do family therapy when the world reopens. 

That was pretty much it for that night but today she woke us all up to go to a park and walk around, so we did and it was nice. It was just me, her and my brother and sister all day. When we got home from that we took the dog on a walk and that was nice too but then we made a campfire and ordered takeout and ate around it. This is where shit got really weird as my mom started talking all about how she's suicidal and my dad WANTS her to kill herself and she has to stay locked in her room and not talk to him, and if he finds out she got us food he'll break down her door and hurt her or something. My dad has not shown any sign of doing any of this, now or before. She's going into detail about how she would down the whole bottle of blue sleeping pills. Then she's asking us if WE want her to kill herself and my brother speaks up and says ""No! Why are you telling us this?""

I calm her down by saying that we'd all do family therapy when the world isn't locked down and the rest of the dinner is awkward as hell but we get thru, then we watch mrs. doubtfire and it's all good, we all go to bed and I think it's over here. My dad hadn't come home from work that day because he didn't want to fight at home so he stayed late and then did some grocery shopping, then came home but walked around the neighborhood for a long time before my mom went to bed and he came inside. 

I have another brother(19m) and he's at home from college over break. He has aspergers and hates being around tense social situations such as this one so for the past few days he's pretty much only been home to sleep. And tonight he hasn't come home yet and my mom starts texting me saying she's gonna call the cops to find him and bring him home. She goes downstairs to clean up so the cops can come and sees my dad sitting on the couch and runs back upstairs and locks her door. Then she starts texting me that he's here, how did he get in, where did he come from, and if he finds out she's looking for my older brother he'll kick down her door and hurt her. I say I'll just go ask him if he knows and she tells me not to then says ""God I wish I was dead."" And that's all that's happened as of this moment.

I genuinely don't know what to do. This may be selfish or heartless but I just want my little brother and sister to be away from all of this. They're just kids and I don't want them to think this is normal. I want them to grow up without having to hear their mother ask them if they want her dead. I don't know how to solve what my family is going through while all the therapy offices and services are closed during the quarantine. My mom's been unloading a lot of feelings about depression and suicide on me over text for two days and I don't know what I'm supposed to do or say. My dad thinks she's putting on a show but since they won't go near each other I don't think he's seeing what me and my siblings are really going through. Since my older brother's gone and my dad doesn't want anything to do with my mom and my mom's...going through stuff, I feel like it's kind of up to me and I don't know what I can do here.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for responding. I’ve read each and every one and I was taking it all into account and preparing for another bad day today, which it seemed to be because I was woken up to my mom crying about how my dad’s ruining our lives. So I went to talk to my dad and told him what a lot of people here were saying, that my siblings shouldn’t be subjected to this kind of drama and I shouldn’t have to be shouldering the responsibility either. He was still mad at her when I went back to sleep, but when I woke up later...everything was fine. Apparently they had talked or something, and all day it’s been like nothing ever happened. It’s really weird. 
So I guess it was all for attention. But I’ll be damned if I’m gonna sweep it under the rug so it can happen again later, so I’m still going to keep what all of you said in mind and try to get my family into some counseling and move forwards professional help for my mom. Again, thank you all for helping me out, because I really had nowhere to go.",2020.0,5.0,16.0,19:26:40,victim,11
536,59,128,My (22f) neighbor keeps hitting his kid and I’m not sure what I should do,125.0,gj3y51,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gj3y51/my_22f_neighbor_keeps_hitting_his_kid_and_im_not/,64.0,1589421308.0,"This all really boils down to the spanking debate. I wouldn’t spank my kids if I had any, but I know that isn’t the viewpoint of many parents. Regardless of how you feel about spanking, what I’m trying to describe seem excessive and quite unhealthy. I’m concerned. 

So I live in an apartment with thin walls and my neighbor (maybe late 30s white m) only lives with his girlfriend sometimes. And even less frequently than that he brings his kid over. I have never seen the kid, but lord can I hear them. 

Usually, if the kid is there, they’re loud and happy for the most part. They play with toy instruments all day and like to sing along to movies. They laugh and play games but sometimes, out of nowhere it seems, my neighbor gets pissed with the child. He’ll start saying stupid shit like “bro grow up” “I’m sick of your shit dawg” and “dude get over it” as well as other sort of similar comments. I find this to be quite an inappropriate way to talk to your child. 

Every time I hear him take this tone the kid gets worked up. They’ll start to yell “no no daddy no” over and over again. They say things like “you scare me” “you make me angry” “leave me alone”. 
I can here them running around his apartment. 
If my neighbor catches them, he spanks them loud enough for me to hear the slaps through the wall, and the kid screams. And screams. 

Most of the time the girlfriend steps in and separates them. She comforts the kid and sends the neighbor off to cool down. Then it all goes back to normal. 

Now my dilemma is whether or not I should call CPS. The kid can be a brat and definitely does things to set off my neighbor on occasion. However for the most part the kid sounds genuinely terrified of him. I myself don’t want to confront my neighbor because he looks like a recovered meth head and he certainly isn’t afraid to get physical. I’m not so strong enough to be able to defend my self from a grown man losing his temper on me. 
I don’t wanna rip a family apart tho. As a kid my parents weren’t the greatest, and cps was called on our family, and even though it might’ve been warranted sometimes, my siblings and I didn’t wanna be taken away from them. We loved our parents and didn’t want to be separated from one another. I also remember the cps visits doing more damage than good once they left; some of the physical abuse turned to emotional and psychological abuse which left lasting marks on each of us. We’re all grown now and we’ve each come to terms with how our parents raised us and our family is pretty chill now. In many ways I’m very glad our family was able to stay together.

I don’t want to get involved if it’s not what’s best for everyone, but I’m having a hard time figuring it out. Like I haven’t even seen the kid and I know nothing aside from what I can hear through my walls. I don’t really know anyone involved more than to just recognize them in building. They have only be in the building since Christmas and we haven’t really talked other than when taking the elevator together. And this doesn’t happen all the time, it’s only a couple times a week that the kids even over, and maybe only once a week that these incidents take place. 

And honestly, while I am largely concerned for the kid, a secret selfish part of me just wants all the screaming to stop so I can sleep. Is that clouding my judgement? Would calling cps just be a selfish thing to do? 
What do y’all think?

TL;DR
My neighbor beats on a child I’ve never seen and I can hear it all through the thin walls. I don’t wanna overstep and call cps if it isn’t warranted. I’m trying to figure out if I’m being an overreactive nosy neighbor or if I am justified in my concerns.

Edit: I’m really glad that I wasn’t misreading things. I will be calling cps on my lunch break. I’ve looked into the laws in my area and without seeing the kid I can say if he’s using legal reasonable force, but that’s CPS’s call anyway. Thank you for encouraging me to do what’s right. I appreciate it!
Edit 2: just wanted everyone to know that I’ve called and made a report. The case agent is supposed to head out there today. Hopefully all things go well :)",2020.0,5.0,14.0,07:40:08,victim,30

She was intoxicated I was not and I told her she should pick it up tomorrow. She stated no, I advised her I would grab it on the way to work tomorrow she was not happy with that and I finally said I would drive there tonight and get it and Ill leave in a bit.  She obvious was not happy with that and went upstairs and got redressed and I did not know she was doing this and when she came down I told her she was not leaving I would go. She grabbed her keys and went to the door. I stood in her way with my hand on the front door preventing her from opening it and she began cursing and screaming. I did scream at her back saying I was not letting her leave drunk and I would go. She mocked me back about what I said and made some comment about me a good role model for our kids.  I turned around and walked away to leave and go and she hit me in the back of my head with her sandles. I was now extremely  pissed and went to the garage where her alcohol was and was going to dump the rest so she could not get any drunker. She ran in and was screaming and began attacking my from behind to get the liquor bottle back and ripped my shirt off my body and I finally gave her the bottle. We were screaming and my oldest son (18) was scared and called the police.  I was now gone from the house when the police arrived. My wife called cursing me out how I called the police. I did not and knew my son had ( he called me and told me) but I would tell my wife that.  She continued to call me names etc.. She finally did figure out my son called. The next day she told my son he had no business doing that and it was none of his business.  I told him he needed to do what he felt was right and he was not fault for this we were. My wife will take no responsibility this, has not apologized, and has blamed me for what happen that night.  I want to go to marriage counselor,but with the pandemic at this moment that is not on the table for at least a few more weeks.  We not talked about it since then, I have not really looked at her, touched her, or told her I love her since then. When I normally do this several times a day.  Should I try counseling?

My family and friends don't like this girl and have been disappointed on the number of times I've come back to her. She always finds a way to convince me that coming back to her is the right move. She has bipolar and depression too. Anyways, the other night she said she wants me to leave my ""stupid"" job (that I actually quite enjoy) and all my friends because they all don't like her. I don't talk about her with my friends anymore so as not to stir the pot. After making these demands I refused and went home. I ignored her plethora of messages for two days before I accidentally answered one of her calls and got roped in (I didn't know houseparty automatically joined you). She went back on her statements and said she no longer cares who I'm friends with and she's willing to deal with my job. She literally begged for me back and I accepted but still don't feel quite right. She also got quite mad at me for talking to a girl who I'm friends with while I was ignoring her (nothing but small talk). She made me feel really bad about how everyone in my life hates her. They call her manipulative, abusive, toxic.  Idk if they know the full story enough though. We had a five hour phone call where she kept switching between anger at me, to begging to change and to have me back. She said she was miserable in this town but I want to stay for a few years. Originally we had broken up because she wanted to leave town next year, but now she says as long as she has me, she'll stay here. I feel bad for keeping her here sometimes. All of this happened while she was on her period and probably having a bipolar episode, but she did hurt my feelings tbh when she said she's all I'll ever have and without her I can't fend for myself. She apologized but she said there was some truth and she just wished she said it nicer. I honestly felt pretty good during the time I was ignoring her. Also, she was talking to a guy during that time too but she said it's different because I was the one ignoring her. She also bought cigarettes to make me upset but didn't smoke them (smoking is a deal breaker for me). She really cares about me (she tried walking to my house which is an hour drive up a steep hill when we broke up, but then decided that was crazy. I've lost a few friends over my time with her and I don't think she's too worried about that because ""she'll always take care of me"".

539,62,132,Abusive wife; I'm convinced she's changed our daughter's personality,94.0,ghsqxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ghsqxb/abusive_wife_im_convinced_shes_changed_our/,82.0,1589248880.0,"34M, 32F, with 12F daughter. Together 15 years.

I love my wife but I am at my limits and I don't know how to move forward.

I think my wife herself and her external issues (her family, friends, etc) are leaking into my daughter's personality.

My wife turned into an unstable person fairly quick after our daughter was born. She had a spat of infidelity, which we somehow worked through (even though it damaged me greatly). She had a few decent years since despite her constant crazy family, but then she fell into depression (so she says) and started getting heavy into pills to the point where she has withdrawals now if she doesn't have them. Up all night, sleep all day, doesn't work, and contribute much to the general house work but somehow has time for friends multiple times a week :/

She's turned into a monster is the only way to describe it. Constant daily yelling and screaming at me and my daughter over the littlest things. Even throwing stuff on the floor sometimes. Cursing and yelling at our daughter for things and threating to kill herself ""if things don't improve"".

She verbally abuses myself and my daughter daily at the top of her lungs... could be something out of place, or dishes not done the way she likes it. She's begun to also ""smack"" our daughter on her ass hard if she's not happy with something our daughter has done or said.

Her family doesn't help at all - they're the type that scams the government support services, call cops on each other, belittle each other. They constantly belittle myself and my wife weekly, even threaten us for certain things if something doesn't go their way (just like my wife does).

Her friends, same deal - they're questionable people... pretty sure all of them are unemployed since forever, scamming services, doing drugs all day, no responsibilities.

I think her own issues, her own family, and her own friends are turning her into the person she is. Its been like this for years now, slowly getting worse, but these past few months it has sky rocketed.

I can no longer talk to her about these issues - I can't speak about how she shouldn't say the things she says to me and my daughter, I can't speak about how she shouldn't smack our daughters ass and how she needs to talk and communicate instead... I can't say anything... she starts a huge fight and puts me to the ground because its ""not her way"" of doing things. Meanwhile, I remain calm and an adult about it each time and get yelled at to ""show some fucking emotion"".

So we have:

* Drug abuse
* Physical/verbal abuse
* Bad parents
* Bad friends

My daughter is constantly around all this... and she's started to act badly towards her own friends which has caused its own set of issues.

I dug into my daughter properly (nice sit down, calm adult-like talk), and found out my wife is the problem. From my own daughter's mouth she's claims she talks bad to her friends because ""mommy does it all the time"", she belittles people because ""mommy does it all the time"", she has a bad attitude because everyday she's yelled at and can't even have a proper relationship with her own mother or do anything with her own mother because it just leads to a fight.

So I believe she's telling the truth, this is a bad environment for her clearly.

My wife's family are monsters... in-turn tricked into my wife... in-turn trickled now into my daughter. Thats my theory anyways.

I can't talk to my wife about any of this though... I've countless times tried, as mentioned before, it just leads to her screaming and yelling at me, and sometimes blaming me for it all.

What are my options.. I honestly feel like divorce right now I'm so at wits end. Only way I can see to remove her from the house, and at least get my daughter away from her 1/2 the time while she hopefully works on herself and gets support. I don't know what else do to because theres no counseling services here (closet one is 3 hour drive).

&#x200B;

Any tips on what I should be doing here? Thanks!

I’m not sure if this fits the subreddit perfectly, but please do t take it down. I’m not sure what to do. 

My (17M) father (middle aged) is mistreating our dog and I don’t know what to do. Our dog is an older Bernese mountain dog, who is slow and not always the most responsive. She often has to be told multiple times a command before she can be persuaded to follow it. This is especially true with her at bedtime. We keep her inside over night, but let her be outside up until we go to bed. However, that means we have to call her right before she goes to bed, when she’s often really tired and doesn’t want to get up/move (like I said, she’s old, so this isn’t entirely unexpected). Anyways, my dad often can’t be bothered to wait for her to get up/ get moving, and after calling her once or twice, proceeds to storm out into the yard, grab her by the collar, and haul on her, basically dragging her into the house. While this happens, she yelps in pain the whole way to the house. Once there, he sets her down and then knees her in the back to force her to move. 

I find this horrible. I don’t think dogs are meant to be treated that way anyways, especially our dog. The vet has said that she has stiff neck joints, so pulling her by her collar can’t be good for her. 

Furthermore, I make my opinions vocal. The last time it happened (tonight), I went flying outside to stop him (before he even did it, I just had a sense that he was going to tonight) and got sternly told to back off. We then had around a two minute yelling argument, in which I argued that it was bad for the dog and didn’t teach her discipline, and he claimed that it teaches her to listen. Anyways, I went to sooth/pet the dog, and he went off to bed before we could talk. Now I don’t know what to do. He’s really stubborn and won’t change his view, but will punish me if I attempt to change his view by anything other than talking (e.g. yelling, saying “god damn” or any other “bad” words, etc), and talking just doesn’t do anything. 

I want to clarify that on most other matters, I totally love him. He’s a great dad and is fun to be around, but he has some ideas in his head that are harmful to others, and has such a cockheaded nature about doing his own thing that it hurts those around him. I just don’t know what to do. How do I talk to him/show him a better way? Am I overreacting? Ty for all you can do, great reddit

541,64,135,My [31/m] brother [34/m] used to beat me quite severely as a kid. Family doesn't care and expect me to have a friendly relationship with me,526.0,g79k3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g79k3f/my_31m_brother_34m_used_to_beat_me_quite_severely/,82.0,1587768103.0,"So let's go back to the beginning, my childhood. When I look back, my first memories are not my parents or some nice events, but just my brother beating me because he wanted to get some toy I was using. I have no idea when he started but that's just what happened for years and years.

To give you an idea of what went though my mind as a kid, my parents were worried about me hanging out with school friends and wanted me to always stay home when not in school. Maybe also because of this I didn't get many friends in school so I didn't really understand what a normal relationship with another kid was supposed to be like. All I knew was that I was supposed to stay with my brother and play with him. That's basically what I did until the beginning of my teenage years, when I finally started to go out with friends and my first girlfriend.

I might give you just an example of what I mean by violence to avoid being boring. Once we decided to play together a video game. Every time somebody ""died"" in the videogame, the other one could play. Once he died after 1 minute and I asked him to make me play. He said that the rule was only valid if he got to play at least a few minutes. I let him play more. When it was my turn I died after 20 seconds. He demanded to play, I refused and I shoved me off of my chair and I hit my head quite hard against some furniture. My mum was there but just told him not to be like that.

Now you might think these things among children are normal and depending on the culture of the family I think they might be. But this was every day of my life in my childhood. It messed me up quite a lot. As a kid I kept on thinking about suicide and how jumping out of the window would have been the best thing. Later in my years in school I became a natural target for bullying because I was so afraid of anyone.

Last time I was beaten by him was when I was around 14yo. I was on the (landline) phone with my girlfriend and he wanted to call his. Result? Yep, getting punched right there while I was still talking with her, with my parents there just telling us to be quiet.

When I was around 17yo he left our house to go to live with a girl. It really was a great period for me, except for some sleeping problems (caused by him? maybe..). He came back two years later when he broke up. After just a few weeks things started to be problematic again. We were sleeping in the same room because the house was quite small and one night he brought a girl home and he went to our room with her. When it was around 10 I knocked on the door asking to go to sleep, because trying to keep on a strict sleeping schedule really helped me. He didn't even answer. I did it again after 15 minutes, then again and again every few minutes. When it was midnight I knocked on the door more furiously calling him names and telling he to get the fuck out. He came back after a few minutes threatening to beat my ass like in the past. My parents were still there and didn't care at all.

At that point I decided it was really too much and after a few days I left and went to live by myself. I still remained decently close to my family, not really with my brother. During the years he did a few more stupid things, again just a simple example when my father died he sold a lot of his stuff without asking me anything just to pocket some money.

Fast-forward to the present, my brother has now a wife and 2 kids. We lived for some years in different cities and now even in different countries. But still, when I go back to visit my family, my family expect me to be happy to see him and to celebrate all together. My girlfriend also doesn't know about any of this so she generally thinks I should be happy to see him. I'm not. Every time I see him I get anxiety, I might have trouble sleeping for a few days and I'm just in a bad mood.

Maybe it was my fault in the past to not be clear about how much the situation hurt me, but today it just looks like I'm on crazy pills, the only one that remembers something bad while everyone else thinks we could be the perfect family. So sometimes I just avoid my family even when I go back to my home country just because I don't know how to explain that he is the problem because I feel that after so many years it would be weird to bring this up.

Sometimes I think I should just forgive and forget but it's just not that easy.",2020.0,4.0,25.0,04:26:43,victim,20

She asked me a bunch of specific questions and then told me I’ve been experiencing “a tremendous amount of abuse” and I’ve been regularly sexually assaulted through “sexual coercion” and other stuff I don’t remember the technical term to. Like him pressuring me heavily to have another baby, and him “punishing” me for not having sex by starting fights, even on my period. 

I feel disgusted, because I’ve been searching for like a year now as to why I experience so many “symptoms” of sexual assault. I thought it happened when I was a child, but it turns out it happens during my marriage. I am afraid to even talk to him about it.

My brother is severely mentally ill and lives at home. He hears voices and sees imaginary shadows/people, has religious delusions about God and his own purpose, has never had a real job but thinks he's going to be a rich and famous rockstar, tried to sleep with a minor(yep), is obsessed with women, treats everyone like shit. We all bend over backwards to put out tiny fires on a daily basis. 

For years it destroyed me. Constantly getting beat up, screamed at, gaslighted, manipulated, etc. Going away to college in 2016 + many years of therapy and medication helped me. 

He is jobless, highly suicidal, not on medication, and refuses all forms of treatment. My mom coddles him like he's 12 years old and denies that his mental health issues are a concern. In her eyes, he's just misunderstood and ""a little sick.""

I'm 5 feet tall and 108 lbs. He is 5'10 and boxes daily ""for fun."" Over Christmas break, he got angry that I wouldn't share my car and beat me up. The cops came, my mom hid him, and then screamed at me for potentially getting him arrested/killed. She told me I'm going to hell and that she loves him more. It stung. I left back to my college town the next day and she never apologized. We had no contact for 2 months until I finally caved in and responded to her texts saying she missed me. She's toxic, I know, but I find it so unfathomable to cut her out of my life because she's my mom. Even when I was angry and ignoring her, I'd get so many feelings of ""I wish I could talk to my mom right now"" or ""what if we never talk again and she passes away and this is how it ends for us?"" 

I came back from college (just graduated) yesterday because I missed my parents(dad, mostly) and somehow the convo circled back to when he last assaulted me. Mom basically told me that if the cops ever get called again she'll hate me forever and that I ""probably hate her too to destroy our family like that"" because she thinks that they'll kill him/charge him with assault. I said I'm not going to sit here and get assaulted for nothing. She cried and told me it'll be all of my fault if he ever gets killed, and that she hopes I'm happy with that guilt/outcome. 

I've spent three (painful) years accepting my family will never be even kind of normal. Part of me wants to cut her/him out of my life, but it would likely destroy my relationship with my father because my mom is so controlling and victimized that she'll be actively punishing him if I cut JUST her off. When I did NC for 2 months he would text me trying to be fair and respect my decision to be NC, but would explain how she was going insane not having a relationship with me. 

What do I do? How do I balance having my mom in my life without her constantly showing me that she thinks his wants/needs are more important than my safety? Im so drained and every time I come home I'm in tears.


TLDR: Violent mentally ill brother hits me, manipulates our mom and basically runs our household. My mom defends him no matter what and it makes me feel so shitty.

Just for background info because this post is very cultural/racial I guess -- I'm black and my boyfriend is white. None of us have any East Asian/Japanese ancestry.

I live in a very diverse country and in a city with large influence of Japanese immigrants and their culture is very present. I have plenty of friends of Japanese descent, including my childhood best friend.

My boyfriend lives in another city and comes to visit. I had known from the start that he was enthusiastic about Japanese games, cartoons and culture. At first I thought fine, whatever makes him happy but it's been getting out of control. He really thinks he knows all about Japanese culture and would probably lecture Japanese people on their own culture (he lectured my best friend once about different types of celebrating a holiday she's celebrated her whole life). The incident I'm about to describe is just one of many similar incidents that have happened over the past 2 years.

We went out for ramen in a small, family owned restaurant close to my place. He starts by criticizing the place's decoration and how it was cheap and trying to be authentic. I just say I think it's cute at this point. When we get our ramen he audibly laughs to himself about how this ramen isn't even the traditional way of making ramen and says it looks too much like the ramen in Naruto (... a Japanese cartoon). 

The thing is, this restaurant is owned by a Japanese grandma, who barely speaks our language and has been making ramen for probably 50 or 60 years. Her decoration? Authentic, brought back from Japan by a son who lives there. Her ramen? Old family recipe. 

Knowing my boyfriend, I let him go off before I told him about the ramen granny being actually Japanese and that her ramen was probably more authentically Japanese than anything he had ever touched. Suddenly he loves the ramen and even goes out of his way to meet the restaurant owner, who is probably a million years old and was back in the kitchen, to compliment her on her amazing restaurant and amazing ramen. He said goodbye in Japanese.

This happened a few months ago but after something about Japan came up in conversation today and he was weird about it again, it got me thinking. He's not usually like that, only when it involves Japanese things. I tried talking to him about how it makes me uncomfortable and how rude it is but he really does think he's an authority on Japanese culture. Like, no, your granny was European.

Long story short-- do I have to just avoid going out for sushi for the rest of my life if I marry this man? I don't want him to stop enjoying his hobbies, which would be abusive, but is it reasonable to ask him to cut back on all this obssession with Japanese culture?

worried about the potential backlash and a fall out.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago, I was going through some insane family frustrations. It was really tough. I (23F) went to visit my boyfriend (28M) at his house. Let’s call him Jon. I may have had a little too much to drink too quickly, I believe I was trying to drown my sorrow with alcohol. I know this pretty bad. I trust(ed) and love Jon very much, so it makes this all that much harder. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just a little background, I am a little emotionally attached to Jon because I gave my virginity to him ( if this is a real thing) a few months ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now back to my issue. I don’t drink much, so I do not process alcohol very well, and Jon knows this. However, I am fully responsible for getting drunk. After the night of drinking too much too fast, I had what I recently learnt is an Alcohol Blackout. Meaning, I may have been partially conscious and I don’t remember a single thing from that night beyond a certain point, because I drunk too much.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning I woke up in this bed fully naked. All I could think about is that I wanted to cover up! I still felt pretty drunk and shitty at this point, but I managed to go pee and in the bathroom I realized that I was really sore in my private area. I returned to ask him what had happened the previous night, and he told he we had \[wild\] sex. Jon said he didn’t want to have sex with me in my drunken blackout state and had tried to sleep in the sofa but tells me that I asked him to come to bed. Again, I don’t remember one thing from this night! 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt sick and asked him what had really happened and why he’d proceeded to have sex with me in that state. He said it’s the most fun sex he’s had and that I was so kinky and told me about all the things we did, things that I’d never do sober. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel violated and betrayed. I can’t face him because feel like he took advantage of me when I was the most vulnerable I have been in our relationship. But at the same time I don’t know if it’s maybe my fault. I don’t know what to, What should I do? I have tried talking with him about it but he’s talking it very lightly. He has done some pretty questionable sexual things in our relationship, but I think I give him a pass as I am not sure what constitutes of sexual abuse and rape in a romantic relationship . Please tell me, what should I do?
.

EDIT: I didn’t think the detail of “questionable sexual things” was important but it appears in some of the comments that an example is required. Here is it: 


As I had mentioned in my post that lost my virginity to him a few months ago. Before that we had tried to have sex and I didn’t feel ready after we begun. I freaked out and asked him to stop but he kept going, there was no penetration with his penis but instead he used his fingers inside me. All this after I had asked him to stop. He said he’d only “finger-fucked” me and that it was okay. Then he said i technically wasn’t a virgin anymore. All this after I had asked him to stop, which he didn’t.
.
.

It has also been pointed out to me that I maybe misusing “blackout drunk”. For clarity, I asked Jon if I was conscious. He told me partially, which I mentioned above. I was semi-conscious by his account. And also I wasn’t “lucid”! He had to carry me to the bathroom because I couldn’t walk, nor stand on my own. I vaguely remember him carrying about because it’s some of the last things I remember. My boyfriend was sober. I was the one drinking like fool.",2020.0,6.0,6.0,06:19:45,victim,23
548,71,153,My physically abusive father [60M] is suddenly trying to be in my [20F] life again and I'm not sure what to do,140.0,giqnmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/giqnmx/my_physically_abusive_father_60m_is_suddenly/,45.0,1589367943.0,"In high school, I lived in an extremely affluent area largely because of my father's income. It was my parents' dream as immigrants, and I always felt ungrateful for feeling like I couldn't fit in. 

My dad was never home growing up, mainly because he was always working. He was the sole breadwinner. He'd go to other countries for work without telling my mom, and if he was home he'd rather be drinking with friends than spending time with me or my siblings. When he usually came home from work at around midnight, if he was in a bad mood, he would beat us. As the oldest, I have the clearest memories of these times, and remember people gossiping, saying how he probably had a secret family somewhere. At one point, my mom wanted to leave him. 

He bought a house in the high income area we live in now to try and win my mom back, and we moved from lower middle class, mainly immigrant community, to an area where my peers had parents who make millions a year. I couldn't relate to a lot of my friends. On top of that, I was extremely mentally ill, not doing as well as I could in school, and had severe insomnia as a result of a house robbery. My parents just beat me instead of helping. I felt like I could turn to no one. The school didn't care and told me ""spanking"" was normal (I was being thrown the stairs, my dad beat me with my textbook against my head, and I was nearly choked to death several times. It wasn't just ""spanking."") My neighbors called the cops on him, and CPS told me that being beat in a wealthy area was better than foster care, and tried to convince me the bruises and cuts on my body were self-inflicted. My family told me I was being overdramatic, and my dad even spread lies to them as well. CPS told me to live with my grandparents for a year, and I eventually moved back in because my dad told CPS he would try to go to counseling and get me counseling (he did neither). 

My senior year of high school I only spoke to my parents whenever I needed to pick up my younger siblings from school, and I chose a college far away. I dropped out because he called me every week goingon emotionally abusive tirades for ""wasting"" his money, and I couldn't handle it anymore. I rekindled my relationship with my mom, but I rarely spoke to my dad. After a year, I eventually decided I wanted to go back to the same college, and he suprised me when he said he would be financially supporting me. 

I guess I'm jealous because now, he's suddenly nice and not an abusive asshole. He jokes with my younger siblings, helps them with homework, and has never raised a hand at them. Immigrant parents don't apologize lmao but I could tell he feels guilt, and is trying to build some sort of a relationship out of the last two decades of bad parenting. He's suddenly interested in my life, and sometimes texts me shoes or clothes he'd think I'd like. He went out of his way to buy these desserts that he remembered I liked when I was 4 or 5 years old, not knowing I now get an allergic reaction to them and haven't had them since I was a kid.  I hate being in the same room as him, and now he wants to make inside jokes with me like he has with my other siblings. 

My parents literally escaped prison camps at my age, and as a child of immigrants I had to shoulder the burden of the trauma they never dealt with, and that's why I go to therapy through my uni in secret (my mom knows, and sort of gets it). I understand that our relationship is complicated, but I don't think they realize or understand the pain I feel and why I can't stand to be near them sometimes, even if they try their hardest to start a relationship with me. I guess I'm just confused on how I should react to this now?",2020.0,5.0,13.0,16:50:43,victim,

On my dads 50th when I was 19 my brother (27m) came and knocked on my door in the middle of the night. I unlocked the door because he said he didn't have anywhere to sleep. I thought it was harmless because he was my brother. He talked to me like normal. Than proceeded to touch me inappropriately and dry hump me. He put his hands down my pants and masturbate me. I was so scared I froze.

I felt a lot of shame and mixed feelings about this. I tried to pretend it didn't happen for at least a year because I was worried that if I told anyone they wouldnt believe me and I didn't want to cause a divide in my family. When it happened, I was going through a lot of different traumas at the time whilst trying to finish my final year of high school. 

So after a year of not telling anyone, I told my sisters fiance during a drinking session. 
He told my  sister (30f) and she told my mum. 
My mum was in denial and she acted with criticism and like nothing happened. She never spoke to my brother and told me that I need to sort it out with him. 

My (30f) sister talked to my brother to confront him and he lied and said it didn't happen and that he just came to my room because he thought I was sad (which was completely wrong because I had such a good night up until that point). 

Despite my fears my mum would invite him to the house like normal. 
My dad didn't know till I told him a few years later out of frustration of them inviting him over. 
Again no real response. I guess they were trying to make sense of it in their minds. How could their son do something like this? Maybe he was abused ect. 

Lately I've been doing a lot of personal work on attachment theory and working on a lot on my boundaries and needs and I told my dad how I was feeling anxious and afraid when they told me my brother was coming over. I laid some boundaries down and explained why I needed them to feel safe. I told them to not invite him into my space. They tried to say I was trying to stop them having a relationship with their son. I told them it was their choice if they wanted to have a relationship with him and they could continue, but just away from me. That they could just visit my brother at his house or in public. I told them I didn't feel comfortable with my brother having a key to the house. 

I thought I got through to them, but they invited my brother over straight after. My younger sister (22f) and my brother and my parents are all having dinner down stairs and they just expect me to stay in my room for hours and not come out if I don't want to face it. 

I feel a little defeated. I'm not sure what to do next.
I want to have a good relationship with my family. But I haven't been able to forgive my brother. 
I used to be close with him. But not after what he did. And he still says weird things if he's invited himself in the house and I'm alone.

I don't know if it will get any traction this time around but the comments were so helpful to me that I'd like them to keep coming, so if this allowed, I'm reposting on a ThrowRA account so it doesn't get capped.)

This is gonna be a long one, but please read if you have time.

I'm  24, my girlfriend is 22 and her sister is 26, and she's nuts. I've been living at her house with her mum and sister as I was visiting when lockdown started.

Her sister has a  serious problem with sharing her family, her mum and dad split up when  she was a kid, and since then she's been sabotaging relationships. The  dad wanted to get back with the mum after they broke up, but the mum  wasn't having it, so the sister would go round to the dad's house and  fill his head with false hope that she wanted him back, she didn't. It  got messy..

Fast forward a few  years, the mum and dad are in various separate relationships, the sister  always sabotages them, acts so difficult and nasty that the new partner  leaves, citing her as the reason. Always telling the new partners ""this  is my house not yours, and you'll never be my mum/dad."".. Making false  claims that the new partner was abusing her. Basically scaring them  away.

So anyway we've got this  nightmare girl that sabotages relationships and is generally a crazy  person. Enter me, I met my girlfriend online we spoke for a few months  before even meeting, then I start going to her house regularly. The  sister hates me for ""stealing her sister"", spending too much time with  me and not her. At the slightest argument she'll explode into anger, screaming (not even words, just screaming like ""AAAAH, AAAAAAH, AAAAAH"" for 5 minutes straight, the neighbours must be sick of her shit), hitting my girlfriend or her mum, pulling her hair out and punching herself. Bare in mind she's an attractive 26 year old girl who  would seem totally normal if you met her in public.

One  time she lied to her mum and dad saying I was being horrible to my gf,  calling her fat and not letting her eat, which they questioned me about,  prefacing it with ""listen, we know she lies, and we know you wouldn't  do this, but we have to ask.. "" of course I didn't (it was still awkward  though), and the gf went mad saying I'd never say that.. (I'm close  with the parents and I'm great to my gf)

When  my gf makes a comment about me and her eventually moving out together,  the sister hates it and my gf is too scared to move out with me incase  she gets too depressed or hurts herself. She makes flippant remarks  about suicide I guess to get her own way.

She's  so attached to her family it's crazy, she even hates all my girlfriends  friends, she calls her dad daddy and kisses him on the lips, she  seriously acts and talks like a little girl around him and she's 26,  it's all just very strange. When I've been round I've heard her making  nasty comments downstairs I can hear her saying ""ugh is he still here""  and ""whens he going home"" and just doing petty things, like when we went  on holiday a while ago with me, the gf, gf sister, their dad and 2  friends. She went in one of those seaside shops and bought a bunch of  friendship bracelets, gave them to everyone but me. Just really stupid  childish petty shit. I'm sick of being made to feel not welcome, she  tries to cause arguments between me and my gf which sometimes succeed purely because she makes us both angry and we end up lashing out at eachother, but we always make up after, so when that failed she  even lied her way to try and turn my parents against hers. It failed  too. why can't she just be happy her sister has found someone that makes  her happy? She's not gonna break us up and she needs to give up. I'm  sick of it.

I don't know what  advice I'm looking for, maybe some kind of mental condition she could be  suffering from? How to deal with her? I just needed to vent man. Thanks  for listening, whoevers reading this. I appreciate you.",2020.0,6.0,3.0,02:01:34,victim,24
551,74,163,Husband (25) is specifically against adoption/surrogacy and only wants “natural” children. I (23) am specifically against pregnancy. We both want another child. What now?,187.0,guo93d,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/guo93d/husband_25_is_specifically_against/,109.0,1591059528.0,"I had a volatile pregnancy ending in medically necessary termination, followed by a very emotional miscarriage, then finally pregnancy with my now 3 year old son which was also horrible. The final pregnancy left me physically and emotionally scarred in ways I didn’t even comprehend before. I will never willingly be pregnant again. I am young, but if I was given a button that instantly rendered me infertile you can’t imagine how fast I would hit that button. 

My husband is very traditional. When we first met he had outdated views on gender roles, race, and sexuality. He was what one would consider an average “southern republican” although didn’t really follow politics. Over time he eventually became more and more tolerant, and now is a kind an loving man who you’d never expect was that way before. The only thing that hasn’t really changed is the problem at hand. 

He believes adoption is “fake” and “unnatural”. He often says things like “I want to have a *real* child” and refers to adopted/foster children as “always damaged” in comparison to “children who’s bloodline we are comfortable with”. Not exact quotes but the idea behind them is the same. 

I argue that our bloodline is extremely undesirable already. We have extreme cases of substance and emotional abuse (grandparents) schizophrenia, bipolar, anxiety, and depression (our siblings and parents all have at least one of these, often multiples). We ourselves have disorders, but ones that are being taken care of with therapy (I have OCD and he has depression and adhd) and do not interfere with our lives. Also my paternal side is completely unknown as my mom married another man when I was 2, and my bio dad has been out of the picture since then. 

I also argue that with adoption, we can be somewhat picky in that we don’t get placed with a child we cannot handle emotionally or financially, such as extreme mental or physical illness requiring constant care. Whereas with pregnancy it’s a huge toss up and dice roll of wether we’ll get a “normal” child or not. Although I would love any child the same, I don’t want to put them in a home they won’t get the care they deserve at. 

And I’ve suggested surrogacy, although I’d prefer a slightly older child, but he doesn’t consider it “natural” enough. Basically my options are no child at all or child from inside me. I have told him how unhealthy it would be for me to have a child naturally in my current state, as I would resent the child and likely my husband as well for pushing me into an unwanted pregnancy. That is not fair for anyone in our family. 

But I also see how it would be unfair to bring an adopted child into our home with my husbands views. Who would want to be raised in a home where your mom wanted you but your dad thought you were “unnatural” and “broken”. 

He also says even if we do adopt, he’d only be willing if the child had absolutely no living family. He’s afraid a “crazy mom” will come and try to take back the child. I think the fear is irrational, and puts completely unrealistic expectations on the process. I would personally even be comfortable with an open adoption. The more people who love a child the merrier, right?

We’re both getting really sad as time goes on, because we want our son to have siblings. He just turned three and unless I get pregnant immediately, which itself is unlikely, the age gap will already be more than we used to hope. Before I became afraid of pregnancy we planned to have 2-3 children with an age gap of 2-3 years, god willing I got pregnant when we planned. I still want this, but I cannot handle another pregnancy. If it was possible I’d just take the whole uterus out now. It’s useless to me. 

We don’t have other outstanding marital issues besides this, our sex life is fine and we connect emotionally well. We’re financially stable and currently live in a 3 bedroom house, but plan to upgrade in the future. I am finishing a degree in a high income field and my husband is making a comfortable income now. Our son is extremely sociable and loves babies and kids. We have no pets but want a dog in the future, and we used to have a cat but he moved during my pregnancy as I couldn’t properly take care of him. 

So does anyone have advise? We have therapists and have mentioned this, but we don’t have couples therapy. Our insurance won’t let us do both.",2020.0,6.0,2.0,06:43:48,victim,

I (31F)  been married to my husband (36M) three years now and we have a baby. Things are normally fine, he is generally caring and a great father. However, he is generally critical of almost everything I do. The way I eat, dress, cook, care for our child. Almost everything really and I grow irritated of it and complained about it a lot. He tones it down sometimes but it is there almost always. 
What irritates me most is his denial of it. He says he is not criticizing anything he is simply asking for improvements. ‘Suggesting’ things for my own sake, etc, which is more upsetting than the criticism itself sometimes. 
We got in yet again another argument last night and things escalated to yelling. He asked me to be more attentive while watching the baby and try to give her all my attention. I told him I need to also work and do chores and that when he watches her he is on his phone always so he really should stop giving me orders on how to care for her. Specially with him doing the exact opposite. He didn’t like it, he kept asking me to stop interrupting him but I just couldn’t let go of this. I was tired after long day of work/ baby caring/ home chores and now ending it all with yet another unappreciative talk from him. I didn’t stop talking to let him finish. 
He really got upset, started screaming shut up and raised a chair in my way acting like he will throw it at me. I really got scared but told him to go f* himself and I am not scared of him. 

I know I didn’t handle things the best way possible but I am just really tired and fed up. He did this before and I told him if he ever hit me I will leave him and I will not accept physical violence. But this is not his first threat and I really don’t know what to do. Plus I am all by myself in this country where all my family and friends are thousands of miles away. I am too embarrassed to even vent to my family or friends really.

my (17f) little brother (15m), who we’ll call Cole, has been a problem in my family for years, since he was about 10.

my mom is a single parent. at one point in time, i had a pretty good relationship with my father, but Cole’s dad has been out of the picture his whole life- a sperm donor kind of deal. my mom is also an entrepreneur, and therefore super busy, so we’ve had an au pair since cole’s birth. we’ll call her Marie. Marie has lived in our house since forever, and at this point, we consider her family. Marie and my mom have coparented Cole his whole life. 

as a little kid, Cole was unbelievable sweet. he insisted on wearing a suit and tie to school everyday. he was kind to everyone he met and did well in school, but things couldn’t be more different now, and it’s causing a strain on everyone in my family.

Cole’s change in personality has gotten drastically worse over the years. 
at age 11, Cole started struggling in school, so my mom got him tutoring, but things only got worse. 
by age 12, Cole started showing aggression and violence. 
at age 13, he started manipulating my mom, calling me fat, telling marie that she was a “bitch”. 
now, at age 15, he is off the rails. Cole is smoking weed, failing out of high school (it’s his freshman year), going to friends houses without telling anyone where he’s going, stealing money. 

throughout all of this, Cole was diagnosed with severe ADHD and ODD (Oppositional Defiance Disorder). my mom has spent thousands of dollars trying to help Cole. 
-personal tutoring
-therapy (for both herself and Cole)
-Brain Balance 
-severe grounding
-and most recently, military school

military school was going well. Cole’s teachers said they were seeing a SLIGHT hint of improvement, and my house was calm again. but with all the COVID chaos going on, Cole had to return home. unfortunately, my mom can’t afford to sent him for another year. they aren’t offering a refund, and it’s just too expensive.

with Cole home, things are even worse than they were before.

First of all, Cole DEMANDS money any chance he gets. if my mom tells Cole to walk the dogs, he’ll say “sure, for $10”. 
Cole won’t even eat the food we make him anymore. he will look at the dinner my mom makes, say “that looks like dog shit”, and then go downstairs and eat Cheez Its for dinner. he has no sense of family or love. it’s heartbreaking to watch. 

he screams at my mom, Marie, and i. calls us “dumb shits” for asking him to pick up his shoes. tells us that when he grows up, he’s going to leave and never see any of us again. all while he is failing school. 

and then immediately after the fight, he acts nice for about 15 minutes. after the 15 minutes, he asks us to go get him Zaxbys. or to bring him to a friends house. or that he “deserves a new phone”. when my mom or marie tells him no, he says something like “of course you say no, i don’t expect anything less from selfish people like you”. 

so Marie has now just stopped saying no, in hopes that saying yes will make Cole better. Marie has started giving Cole her credit card to get whatever he wants. Mcdonald’s, Zaxbys, Chick Fil A. Cole skateboards there, gets $15 worth of food, and doesn’t even say thank you. 

my mom and i have BEGGED Marie to stop, but Marie is 76, and tired of fighting with Cole. so she doesn’t. and i don’t think she will. so far, he’s spent about $500 of her money, on God knows what. she’s supposed to be saving this money so that she can move back to her home country. 

i’ve tried to explain to Cole how wrong this whole situation is. that we’re trying to HELP HIM. he doesn’t get it. he doesn’t think scream cursing at us is bad. he doesn’t think stealing money from Marie, a 76 year old woman, is bad. he doesn’t think failing out of school is bad. because “we deserve it”. 

he is selfish in every sense of the word, and my family and i are at our wits end with Cole. we simply don’t know what to do anymore. i find myself thinking “i wish he wasn’t my brother”, and it scares me. i love Cole, and I just want to help him. but i can’t. it seems like no one can. and so i’ve turned to you, reddit. 

i’m sorry if this is all over the place. regarding Cole, i have lots of emotions and things to say, and it’s difficult to voice what i’m feeling with him. 

again, thank you in advance. from me and my whole family. any advice you have is much appreciated. 

TLDR- my brother is a selfish teenager who treats my family and i like complete garbage despite our best efforts to help him",2020.0,5.0,16.0,12:12:11,victim,17

My boyfriend ""Caleb"" \[25M\] and I \[24F\] live in the US have been dating for just under 3 years and living together for about 6 months. I've known he uses Reddit, but never wondered what sorts of things he uses it for. I typically use my main account to browse, and rarely to post. We never exchanged usernames and don't interact with each other on this platform. Recently, Caleb showed me a Reddit post on his laptop and I noticed his username in the top corner.

I don't know what compelled me to do so, but a few days ago I searched his username and viewed his profile/recent activity. I know this was snooping and probably wrong to do, but what I saw on his profile hasn't sat well with me and I'm a bit at a loss for how to proceed. He is active in some subreddits related to a few of his hobbies, but most of his activity involves posting/commenting in men's rights, incel, and antifeminism subreddits. He will get into heated arguments with strangers on feminist or mainstream subreddits and use misogynistic slurs (ex. ""90% of rape accusations from women are fabricated for attention after guilt for being sluts sets in"", ""if this situation were reversed in gender this man would be crucified, society is unfairly biased against men"", ""whores who let men buy them drinks at the bar with no expectation of sleeping with them are committing psychological abuse"", and worse). Some of the arguments span a number of hours and he will pick arguments and make disparaging remarks toward multiple users on the same post. Some of these online arguments coincide with times that he's been in a bad mood/not texted me back for several hours (currently quarantining with my family states away), which explains some of his poor mood at that time.

This is so unlike the Caleb I know in real life. I'm having trouble reconciling these two sides of him: the one that I know in real life and the one whose online activity I've viewed. Part of me wants to bring this up to him, but I'm not sure how to bring it up without the argument centering on the fact that I snooped/invaded his privacy (which again, I know was wrong). At the same time, I don't know how I can pretend that I'm not aware of this side of him. It's very unattractive to me someone that would behave like this. I don't want a partner with all of this secret hatred toward women that he feels the need to vent anonymously online.

Should I own up to snooping and bring this up to him to discuss that this bothers me/if so, how? Or is he entitled to his own anonymous online activity that shouldn't be scrutinized?

My mom's not really the best at dealing with other people's emotions. She had me when she was 17 and my whole life has been a cycle of her making me upset, me trying to talk it out with her, and her turning it into a joke. Most of the time I just suck it up and ignore it because my family always takes her side anyway (they say that she's my mom and I can't change her so I just have to deal with it) but I really really can't deal with her touching my chest anymore.

It's not exactly groping to be clear, like she'll just smack my boobs or pinch them or grab them. I don't feel like there's any sexual intent behind it but it still makes me feel insanely gross. We do live in the southern USA where people are normally touchy even with strangers but people don't do THAT.... She's also done stuff like pinch my thighs and continue even after I asked her to stop (once she kept going higher and higher along my thighs and didn't stop even though I was crying and having a panic attack and begging to leave), but the only thing she continues to do regularly is the chest stuff. As of writing this post, the most recent time she did it to me was a few hours ago (she also got angry at me for being upset when I crossed my arms to cover my chest).

She maintains that it's just a joke and since I'm her kid I should be fine with it. I've always felt nasty when adults touched me and I think it may have something to do with some bad experiences with my biological father when I was little (I told my mom but she doesn't believe me even though he's a convicted offender for molesting other minors). But for the most part I've been able to just grit my teeth through it, but I literally can't take this anymore. My grandma told me it shouldn't make me uncomfortable because my mom's a woman, and that it would only be weird if she was a man. She also said I can't blame my mom for my ""insecurities"" when I said her touching my chest made me feel like I was going to vomit.

How do I get my mom to stop without her making it a joke or turning it around on me? It's been going on for years and as I've gotten older it has just been making me feel worse and worse. It hurts so much when she makes fun of me for being upset and says I need to learn to take a joke. I've tried to sit down with her and explain that it makes me genuinely uncomfortable even though I know she doesn't have any predatory intentions but she just tells me to grow thicker skin.

TL;DR: Mom keeps touching my boobs and everytime I try to ask her to stop she says I can't take a joke. What do I do?",2020.0,5.0,5.0,15:47:08,victim,17

First of all, thanks for the support. Everybody's help here helped me make the decision to get the hell away from her. A lot of your comments really hit home, really insightful, so thank you.

Anyway, last night, she posted on Facebook a suicide threat. I saw the post, after hearing her shuffling around in the other room. I go into her room, there's empty bottles, pills, so I tell her she needs to go to the bathroom and try to throw up. She said ""just let me die."" I finally say I have to call 911. I didn't want to, but I had to. I gave her like twenty warnings that I was going to call 911, if she didn't try to throw up or do something to sober up. I gave her every warning, she did nothing, wouldn't budge. She finally said, ""I'm leaving then."" She did. She tried to hide. The cops came and eventually called in a helicopter! They were searching all over for her. They finally found her. 

I had recorded three hours of audio that evening and played it for them, just so it was clear what happened and she wouldn't be able to lie about me.

They took her to the hospital. She texted me tons of hate, calling me a ""snitch"", pissed I called 911, saying it was all my fault, saying how ""dare"" I put her in that position, because she suffered some abuse from cops 15 years ago. I didn't want to, but I had no choice. It would be negligent of me NOT to call 911. It looked like she took a mountain pills, and I believe she did.

Now you can imagine if I did not call 911, and she died or got severely injured, and I did nothing. Imagine what would be said of me. So I was in a rock and a hard place. I thought it was extremely low for her to bash me for calling 911, when it is her who put me in that position, with a Facebook post no less announcing she was taking 30 codeine pills and other stuff. She knew I would see it, I was on Facebook in the other room. 

She was at the hospital all day, **so I got my things and left our place. For good. I'm out, finally!** I could get out because she was at the hospital.

She ended up ok, she was not injured by the pills but she did take lot. 

She texted me demanding I pick her up from the hospital. I said the situation was toxic, she needs to focus on getting better, and basically that was it, and that I wouldn't be a part of it anymore. I didn't offer a definitive break up just enough to walk away. 

A barrage of hate and abuse ensued from her after that, calling me an abuser, awful, disgusting person, and I turned off the phone.

I'm not perfect but I didn't deserve this. Her suicide attempt seems to have been a way to just manipulate. I don't think she was serious, but just serious enough to use it all against me, no matter HOW I reacted (whether I did nothing, or did something, all designed to attack me, however I responded. If I did nothing, I would be called a monster for ""not caring"" or trying to save her life. If I call 911, now I'm a ""snitch"" and horrible for that). 

On the audio I recorded I asked WHY she was trying to kill herself and she said, ""You said you weren't invested in me three weeks ago! You said I wasn't family to you!"" 

So if that's ""abuse"" then whatever I give up. I got it on audio. Not that I beat her or cheat on her, not that I hit her, I verbally abuse her, no, none of that -- just that I said I wasn't happy basically. 

Anyway, it's over and I'm done, but I expect she will continue to harass me in any way she can. I'm exhausted. I just spent two years with an EXTREMELY vile, probably Narcissistic / BPD person and I need to try to recover, figure out why I let this happen (I did break up with her like 20 times, but figure out why I wouldn't leave for good), and hope she leaves me alone.

ORIGINAL POST:

I rarely play music I like (U2), but today I did, and when I turned it off my GF blurts out this mocking ""joke"" about how ""sad"" my music is, ""Oh god, ALL that is is SAD music, it's like 'Wah wah wah sad sad sad' oh my god, I could do an imitation of that and put online and people would laugh so hard!"" She was clearly sick of it.

Seemed like a needless, nasty crack, so I give her look, turn it off some other music I put on that she likes, and put on headphones.

This leads to an explosion.

I'm now ""abusive"". She claims she was ""trying to connect"" with me, and said she ""made a funny joke."" She says I hurt her by not laughing. She says I'm basically an idiot for ""not thinking it was funny, everyone would think I was funny."" 

She goes on to say ""you have no friends, you have no one"" and says ""this is why"" and says ""you came from a rich family."" Ok? 

I sit there and mostly just take it.

Later, I TRY to explain how it seemed rude, and just once again snaps and snarls at me.

I bring it up later and say, ""Ok so why did you bring up my rich parents? You know I never took money from them, I made my own way, and you yourself have a huge trust fund you live off of from your parents, so what's your point? Seems hypocritical.""

She snarls, ""If you don't know the point I was making, then F off.""

She later proclaims she is ""never wrong"" and goes on to call me a ""dumbass"".

Now she's been crying really loud for 30 minutes, after I said I don't feel like she's ""family"" or ""has my back"" at all.

She calls me an ""abuser"" constantly.

I don't think what I did was abuse at all. I felt she was rude, so I put on some headphones. That led to me being attacked harangued for 30 minutes. I try to address how I felt, and once again I'm just attacked over and over by her.",2020.0,5.0,26.0,18:25:21,victim,15

I read a lot of posts before posting and read all the rules but there might be something I overlooked. Please don't remove the post, I need help. I'm scared.

I am a 16 year old male and I'm turning 17 soon, I have a younger sister, and my parents are both older than 40.
Not sure how much that matters for advice but hopefully it helps someone.

Basically the current situation has started this morning. I'll reply to comments if more background is wanted but going through an entire relationship in text would be difficult. My mother was yelling very loud at my father (I don't recall/didn't hear what it was about) and so even though I was supposed to get up I stayed in my room. I ended up falling asleep and didn't wake up until a lot later in the afternoon.

When I came out of my room I went into the kitchen/office area and wanted to just talk with my parents or sister or to play a board game or something. There's not much to do in Quarantine and I've been stuck in my house for even longer than the government mandated quarantine time because of online schooling and no extracurricular stuff.

My mother was watching a gardening video on her phone with the volume turned up loud. Her phone doesn't have very good speakers and that combined with the movie persona and unfamiliar accents of the presenters (found out they were Norwegian), the video's audio was very painful to me. Now, when I tried to explain this to my father later he didn't seem to consider it as a very real thing so I assume a lot of redditors might doubt it as well. I most definitely have a sensitivity to sounds, I can't tolerate super loud sounds. The sound of scratching fabric is enough to make me shut down. I'm not sure why I have such a sensitivity (my older sister is in a child psychology course in College and thinks I might have autism but she hasn't finished the course yet and has no practical experience so I take that with a grain of salt). So I asked my mother if she could turn down the video or use her headphones. She has multiple pairs of headphones. She has wireless and wired earbuds.  The wireless earbuds were actually quite expensive and they're very nice headphones that she never uses.

Sorry for going on a tangent there. Basically I asked her if she could use headphones and brought up that the sound was annoying me and was painful. She told me the earbuds are uncomfortable and that she would not be turning off the video and that if it bothered me I could just wear ear plugs, wear my own headphones, or go to my room. That upset me a lot because it felt like she was saying that the inconvenience of earbuds wasn't worth me being out of my room. That might be stupid but idk.

Later I brought my feelings up to my dad about how it felt like I wasn't wanted and how the audio on the video was more than just an annoyance it actually hurt me. He seemed to be understanding and we talked for more. My mom then yelled at us from her bedroom saying we were being too loud and it was annoying her. I quipped back (in hindsight I shouldn't have) that she could wear earplugs or her headphones if the sound was bothering her. This made the situation devolve into an argument. Rather than give a play by play of the argument because my memory isn't that good I'll just give a list of things which happened that I do remember.

1.She threw a bag with some metal stuff (signs, things like that) at me and missed.
2. I said if she threw something else at me I'd throw it back (I never did that, I couldn't do that I just for some reason seem to think doing something back will get people to realize what they're doing is hurtful)
3. She threw wooden acorn decorations and pine cones at me (one of them hit me).
4. She flipped me off and called me an asshole, which doesn't affect me any more but it did bother my father

Afterwards she threatened to leave to which my father replied something along the lines of ""if you're going to run away then do it and stop threatening it"" and for the next couple minutes she kept saying he wanted her to run away which isn't true. Within 10 minutes of saying that he'd calmed down a lot more and apologized saying he doesn't want her to leave and that he was being emotional. She later said something along the lines of ""I don't want to sit at my desk and think about slitting my wrists"". I had come to her weeks before and asked her to not threaten suicide or running away because it really hurts me and my sister but she disregarded that and she never really agreed to that at the time either. She told us to get her suitcases so she could leave and my dad and I both told her no and that we weren't going to help her leave. My sister was crying in her room at the time and I did later go to check up on her.

TL;DR My mom has threatened to leave and actually started packing stuff up. I don't know if she's even still here. She also kind of threatened suicide.

I don't know what to do, I don't know if this qualifies entirely as a relationship advice post but I really need help. Please don't remove it.


EDIT: I just realized I forgot a major thread of the conversation for her. She wanted my father and myself and perhaps even my sister though she never specified to get counseling. Now I'm not opposed to that but the way she talked about it was along the lines of ""I've been in counseling for a long time and have gone to all sorts of religious counseling things so clearly I couldn't be the one in the wrong and you need to change""",2020.0,5.0,18.0,17:20:24,victim,16

TW - murder, rape, substance abuse, unrelenting existential crisis

\-

Four years ago my then-boyfriend had a psychotic break, in which I was raped and beaten over the course of about 12hrs, to an extent that it was life-threatening. I very nearly bled to death on my kitchen floor. When I was at the hospital, I was given antiretrovirals for possible STDs. They didn't give me anything for birth control, but the way it was phrased in the discharge papers, it made it sound like they did. Abortion wasn't an option for me personally when I found out I was pregnant 4mos later. I found myself unable to put my son up for adoption once he was here. All of this really just messed me up. I quit my job, got rid of my apartment, and moved back home with my mom.

In the time that's passed, I've developed a pretty severe addiction to (legally prescribed) Xanax and have been pretty dependent on it for, basically not having constant nightmares 24/7? I don't know if it's a common thing or what, but when I'm not wasted enough I'll be minding my own business and then BAM! I'm back in my apartment, he's raising the liquor bottle to my head. I can actually physically feel his hand around my neck and I can't breathe. Or I'll be back in the courtroom with his mom glaring at me from the gallery, the attorney yelling at me. When this is happening to me, I can't process that it's not reality and will meltdown into the way I felt when it was actually happening. I've actually vomited before. When it's happened in my sleep, I've scratched myself up enough that I'm bleeding. It's really obvious to anyone who's seen me that I'm not ok, I'm basically a pale skeleton with glassy, dead-looking eyes. I don't go outside. I rarely leave my bedroom. I haven't talked to any of my friends or family. My mom has more or less been raising my son while I waste away in front of the TV in a drugged-up haze.

&#x200B;

Recently, I've decided that this isn't ok and I want to be better. I knew that my mom was in denial of my problems, but I wasn't ready for her continuing to be in denial after I started talking frankly about the truth. I've been trying to talk about my feelings and how I don't want to live this way anymore. She just continues to act like there's nothing wrong, as though nothing has happened. Whenever I mention the attack or anything about it, she can't hear me. She can't even acknowledge that it was a thing that happened and that I might need some kind of help for it. However, whenever I've mentioned anything about my son, such as how I've struggled to bond him, she gets angry and outright tells me I'm a horrible person and need to shut the fuck up and get over myself. But that's seriously as close to any kind of acknowledgment that I've been able to get from her.

&#x200B;

I don't really know what to do? I kind of feel doomed honestly. I don't want to keep living in a stumbling blackout forever, but I'm really struggling to do anything better for myself without any support. I don't know how I can get through to my mom?",2020.0,5.0,24.0,16:30:05,victim,12

Small potatoes compared to everything that has happened since then. It’s been like a revolving door of hurts and issues that just have bled together and that one instance seems like a drop in the bucket now. 

I left shortly after I made that post. It was on an account that i deleted out of fear he’d see the post and my comments so i can’t link to it. He came home that day and was cold and distant but didn’t ask me to leave. Just texted that i needed to have his dinner ready. I had it all for him and he took it upstairs and ate and went to bed. I climbed in bed with him and held him and he let me but didn’t reciprocate. 


Things were quiet for a few days but something boiled over for him and he again kicked me out for something, I can’t even remember what. I came to my moms house and stayed for about three days before he came and got me. My mom had it with the up and down and drama and didn’t let me have the car (my car is in her name). I didn’t block his number and he wore me down. Every day telling me if I had just listened to him and fixed my attitude. I cracked and he made me believe that my parents were abusing me by not letting me use a vehicle as I am an adult. I asked him to keep me safe and he said as long as i did the right thing and never ever did the wrong thing ever again, he would. 

He got me. I went back for about three weeks with no car. Got a whole new job making very good money. He got a new job as well. His mom, God bless her she’s an incredible woman, offered to get me a car. We were going to go car shopping tomorrow but i misplaced my drivers license yesterday after work. He asked me to run to the gas station and get him a lemonade and go to the vape shop and get him a coil and juice. I said i would have to go to the bmv tomorrow and get a new license because mine is gone. He lost his collective shit. Called me lazy and disgusting. Worthless. Said he couldn’t stand me and he needed a life partner not a child to baby sit. I cried and begged him and said you’re supposed to be my family. He raised his fist to me and said if I didn’t shut the fuck up he was going to knock my teeth in. I went into the spare room to cry and he bagged my belongings up and threw them outside. Then locked his bedroom door so i couldn’t get in.

I called my mom. Again. She got me. Again. He’s texting. Again. But this time I told his mother what was up. I love his family and i didn’t tell her all the horrible details about the names and the threats of violence but i told her he packed my shit up for me and put it on the porch and locked me out. She was furious and I guess kicked him out of the house. Now he’s texting me saying the same old stuff. If i’m just good and listen, I can come home. But i told him no. I said I don’t trust him. I’m being strong. It’s only been a day. Less than a day. But I told him no. I’ve never done that.

He’s got a violent streak in him, i’ve seen him in fights on nights out and doing some awful things to people although i guess i figured he would never hurt me. Since we got together i’ve heard stories of him being abusive to ex partners but he hasn’t actually been physically abusive to me.

I’ve known for a little while now that i dont want to be with him. He can be nasty, isn’t very caring, i’m working from home and he isn’t working at the min so he’s constantly there. In the way, still expects me to cook every night even though he just sits watching tv all day drinking.

I dont know how to approach this. He’s made it very clear that if i tried to leave him he will seriously hurt me and his words are “no one would ever even prove it was me” - i cant leave town as my job, friends and grandma are here. My grandma is the only family i have and she needs me.

I dont know what to do. I have no proof of what hes said and i’m terrified. I know i cant just up and leave, he knows where my gran leaves, he will find me, burn my car, damage my grans property..

The two middle children were female twins. They never got along until they were grown up and I was always fighting one and protecting the other.

When I was 13 I lived with a 24 year old man, my sisters also found men and lived with them. One was abused and had a child from it. The other found a good hardworking man and eventually married him, I got away when I was 17 from the older man I was with. 

The one who got married ended up having a baby girl. They didn’t have much money but his parents gave them a mobile home. They started to do pills, then crushed up pills, then snorting the crushed up pills, and I’m assuming it just kept getting worse. Eventually they were doing heroin. My family called CPS because we didn’t know what else to do and we didn’t want their daughter all alone while they were drugged up. They took her away from them. My sister went into rehab, but her husband refused. A year later she was clean and he had gotten something bad and died. 

It was extremely sad watching this 5 year old cry as her father was put in the ground. I believed that my sister would change and would never want to see her daughter so hurt again. But.. she didn’t. She did get custody of her daughter back, but not even a year later was back on drugs and she got a hold of something bad and died. 

May 25th made a year since she died. I thought I would be completely torn up like I was when my father died, and I felt weird, but not exactly sad. Sometimes I go back on her Facebook page and read until I can’t take what she says anymore. She lied constantly. And I cannot understand why. It was the smallest stuff, but she still lied. I almost feel like I can’t miss her because I don’t know who the hell im really missing. I feel like I never even knew her. I feel mad more than anything because of her selfishness of what she did to her baby. My son just turned 7 months and I couldn’t imagine having him sit in the house hungry and crying while I’m messed up on drugs. 

I guess I’m wondering if that’s even normal to feel so numb. It’s more of a disappointment than sadness. I don’t know.. any thoughts?

I may not be fully coherent, I'm typing this while looking over my shoulder for reasons that will be evident. This is not a happy update. The comments were enough to snap me out of the disillusion that I am somehow at fault. I recognized I was falling back into old trauma responses. Today I decided to put an end to this. 

This morning I gave him two options. I told him he either tells my family that he's been raping me to their face. This way I'd be able to move back home and have their support. Or I report him straight to the police and they deal with it. What I didn't tell him was that my plan was to use my family as evidence. I figured if they heard him admit to raping me, they would be witnesses to his confession. I'd have more ammo on my side to at least make sure he never comes back, but at best, more evidence to take to the police. 

He of course chose to tell my family himself. That didn't go as planned. They took his side. It's not that they didn't believe me They believed me. They took his confession at face value. But they took his side and decided it's more important to protect him. They begged me not to take this to court. They made it clear they wouldn't help me put him in jail. They asked me to consider their feelings before I did anything rash, and that they didn't want to say goodbye to him. They collectively decided his safety was more important than mine. I had to watch while my mother clung to him for dear life, and sobbed, apologizing on my behalf. 

This is beyond surreal. I don't know what to do. Not only did I just turn my family against me, but he's now living with my family. I genuinely didn't expect this. This is so out of left field. This was the last thing I expected, something beyond a worst case scenario and I'm so confused. I was so confused that I even grabbed my boyfriend and repeatedly asked him if I'm lying. It feels like that's the only reasonable answer to this fucking hellscape dimension. But he reassured me I'm not lying. He did rape me. And I don't know what to do. 

How do I deal with my family? I love them so much, I don't want to leave them, this is so fucking heartbreaking. How do I even try to go along with this relationship? Should I keep the facade up, just until I'm able to leave? What's my safest option, I don't want to end up as a statistic for the ones who couldn't escape domestic abuse.

I realize the immediate answer everyone wants to give me is ""go to the police"" or ""just leave"" but if it were that simple I wouldn't be here. I can't leave. I don't work. I'm a student with no income, no friends, and no family aside from my immediate family that just turned their back on me. I don't even know where I went wrong. Any advice would be amazing, or even just validation that I'm not out of my fucking mind. Feel free to ask for clarification on anything I mentioned because I realize this situation is insane, and even I haven't processed it fully. Maybe someone else can figure out where I fucked up.",2020.0,5.0,31.0,13:50:07,victim,

But she just takes the cake, to give some info, and this will be as unbiased as possible to allow you to form your own opinions. Also note that girlfriends mother refused to let her do anything if it didn’t benefit her, so no car, no license, and no job, her mother makes her stay home and clean the house all day while she goes out on dates with multiple guys, and brings sometimes two home a day. There is also a 8 year old boy in the house.

Recently though, especially with everything going on with COVID-19, she has been taking advantage of my relationship with her daughter to benefit herself. Last night was the final straw, she wanted to bring a guy she had just met into their house, and demanded that I come get her daughter and son and keep them out of the house until the next day. I, being somewhat sane, obviously refused, she then proceeded to absolutely slam me to my girlfriend, telling me I was a piece of shit and will never be able to take care of and provide for her. 

On multiple occasions she has made me pay for everyone’s meal, including her own, and will order quite generously, despite me not making that much money, if I don’t pay, she will just walk out and then leave me with the bill. But perhaps my favorite* example is when she asked me for gas money to go get her son from illinois, to which of course I obliged because I like her son a lot, and think of him as a brother. I even offered to go get him myself, which she refused, the next day, I find out she took the money, left her son in Illinois, and went to spend the weekend with a guy she met on Tinder. When I asked for my 30 dollars back she flat out refused.

At every turn, if I don’t provide for her, I am a terrible boyfriend, older brother, son, etc. And since her family is the way it is, my girlfriend listens to her mothers opinion because she was raised in a controlling and manipulative environment in which her mom is always right. 

I’m not sure how I can continue to support my girlfriend without endorsing and encouraging her mothers bad habits. In addition, how and I supposed to create a lasting relationship if her mother will not let her out of the house.",2020.0,3.0,30.0,06:11:45,victim,19

I hope the mods won't remove my post... please don't.

For a little context and backstory, my parents are extremely religious and abusive and toxic. They claimed and lied to other people that they are homeschooling us but there is no homeschooling happening at home at all (educational neglect). Having friends and going outside is not allowed. Anyone caught having friends will be punished. Me and all of my siblings have grown up basically under house arrest all of our lives and without friends. I have over 4+ siblings. This family is huge. However we the children have no relationship with our extended family and relatives. They all live far away from us. I don't know my uncles nor anyone else. I don't even care to know, especially from what terrible things I've seen from my parents and other people who come from their country. I am afraid of anyone from my family and I can’t trust anyone now. We are completely isolated from the outside world. We (the women) rarely ever go out due to their sexist beliefs.

My parents were physically and emotionally abusive for most of my life. If it weren’t for the physical and emotional abuse, they would’ve been perfect parents. We always had what we needed from food and clothing. However when it comes to education and being loving and respectful towards us they are severely lacking. They use religion to justify their abuse. For that reason me and my brother were planning for years now to move out without telling them, and then later when we have money to come back to help our other siblings. Luckily no sexual abuse happen but there was a few times when they made creepy and inappropriate comments about me and my sisters bodies, and they did rarely spank and hit some of us while naked or tried to strip us naked (take off our underwear or pants). Also there was one incident that happened when I was 13-14 years old where my mom touched and tried to grope my left breast and my father was laughing. But the physical abuse and emotional abuse was the worst as it happen daily and every day when we were kids.

As I don’t have enough time to write the details, on the night of May 12th, my father charged at my brother and attempted to choke my brother and was banging his head with his on the floor. I called the police twice but I wasn’t able to talk with the lady who answered as they would hear me talking to her. I really wish that I just talked anyway. At least told her the address. The lady was on the phone for 4-5 minutes until I canceled the call. I was hoping that the police would arrive but they didn’t. I think they probably didn’t know my location so they didn’t come for that reason as my phone has no service.

My father was angry because my brother became less religious in front of him and he suspected that my brother has a girlfriend and that he is an apostate. That’s the reason why he attacked him. He attacked me for the same reason on March 25th when I was 14 years old. He thought that I had a online boyfriend (I didn’t, I was actually playing multiplayer games with an online friend, a 12 year old girl) and demanded that I enter the password to my computer. I refused because he would find out I have online friends, so he was choking me and yelled that he will kill me first, then my family, then himself. He said that I am embarrassing him (how?) and bring shame to the family. If he actually killed me that day it would be an honor killing (over a game and his suspicions). This happen while my family lived in NYC, at that time my father was an ISIS supporter and I think he is still sympathetic to them. When we were kids he was also a Al Qaeda supporter, but no longer supports them due to religious differences.

When they were accusing my brother of lying (when they were the ones lying) I got sick of it. Me and my siblings have memories, and our memories don’t lie. They are also hypocrites, claiming days before attacking my brother that he is violent/aggressive, when they are the ones that are violent and aggressive. I know very well their anger and aggression as I lived through it.

After the fight, my brother tried telling them in an indirect way (without saying the word abuse) that they abused him over the years and when he was a little kid. He said that’s the reason why he wanted to leave them all this time. My parents told him that he is only looking for an excuse to leave the religion, and what does religion have to do with the abuse. Everything. They even admitted it themselves, when my father kept saying how the children can’t complain nor say no to their parents, and that the parents have many rights over their children while the children have little to none. I was then thinking, what if I tell them about something they did that may be a sin in their religion, to see if they will be remorseful and admit their wrongdoing. So I decided to eventually gather the whole family and tell them about that incident years ago. I just wanted to see do these people have any honor and dignity remaining in them.

After all of that on May 17th I gathered the whole family in the living room. I tried explaining to my parents that all their choices decisions and actions over the years led to my decision to leave them. I started off by telling them of the time my father was looking at and talking about my boobs (when I was 9-11 years old) when they just started growing (he looked at them when I was running around the house playing) and when I told him to stop he just laughed and mocked me (and till today I have no bra and no one bought me one). I then told them about the incident when my mom tried to grope me. It happened when I was 13-14 years old, my mom and dad were talking about their daughters and started saying how we are growing up and becoming women now. They then started talking about how our breasts are growing, and then my mom reached out with her hand to my left breast. She touched it but I moved away quickly looking disturbed at her. My father was laughing and didn’t care about what was happening in front of him. During this whole time I struggled to talk and I felt a choking feeling in my throat. My mom was just screaming at me and sweared by Allah that she didn’t do that (it may be that she genuinely forgot about it, or if she didn’t it means she’s lying). She also said how could I accuse her of doing such a thing. I told them I kept quiet about it all these years because if I complained about anything they would punish me and that you can't tell your parents no. My dad then started talking and tried justifying it, mentioning the metoo movement and what’s happening currently in politics. He mentioned the allegations against Harvey Weinstein, Brett Kavanaugh, and Joe Biden. His point was is that all those women are lying so they could gain something from their lies. He also said that we probably read something about lesbians too (this man really believes that all lesbians and LGBT people are rapists). He said that we (the kids) must have read about those things online and must have been “influenced” by it. I told him that my thoughts and feelings are my own and that nothing “influenced” me. I was really annoyed and angry about this as he was ignoring what I said and it was already so hard to open up and talk about it and he derailed the topic to something unrelated like politics. He didn’t say it directly to me, but I know that in a subtle way he was trying to say that I am lying. I am not stupid. I know what he was saying. He also said that it isn’t haram (a sin) if your mother wants to explain something to you that she has the right to touch your body and that you can’t complain. Basically saying that you have no bodily autonomy nor consent. He also said that everyone is sensitive about something, and told me that I must have been imagining things. I was expecting the both of them to apologize for that incident and try to become better people, but then the both of them only hit a new low. Just revealing themselves to be terrible human beings. They didn’t care about my feelings at all, and just revealed their true selves to me in that moment. Even from a religious point of view they were wrong here but they don’t care. The only thing they care about is to keep up an image of being “perfect” and “flawless”. They will never admit to any wrongdoing and apologize nor change themselves.

For days after that talk I had, in some way I was retraumatized again. The way they reacted to me disgusted and disappointed me. I wasn’t able to eat nor drink and my body started rejecting food and I felt nausea every time I ate. I felt deep anxiety that I didn’t show on the surface. I have learned all these years that I shouldn’t cry nor show my emotions in front of anyone, lest I will be harassed and punished for it. It got a little better now and I can eat again. But it was really painful when I wasn’t able to eat and I frequently went to the bathroom just in case I throw up.

Because of being very stressed out and the pain he felt in his body (especially his shoulders and back) after the fight my brother had a car accident when coming back from work. It’s a minor one but the police said that we have to pay 5000 dollars. My father took away the car keys, not because of the accident, but because of him thinking that my brother has a girlfriend and that he visits her with the car. My brother was quite angry at first about it, but I gave him the idea to buy a bicycle and now he cycles to work and goes with his bike anywhere else, so not having a car wasn’t much of a big deal for us. It will make moving harder but we don’t care.

As things calmed down a little me and my brother decided to wait it out and then move out in July. But I am worried about my sisters and if I leave I am afraid that they will be hurt and that they will do whatever they want with them. Things have gotten really bad here. It always was really bad, but it only hides under the surface and then resurfaces again. My father told my brother that he can't move because he is under 18 and that he can restrict his movement for that reason and that he can't be outside without my father's permission. We don't care as my brother will be with me, my sibling, and it's not illegal for him to live with me. We can't move out now even if we wanted because I am so worried about my sisters.

My mom told one of my sisters that they won’t be buying phones nor computers anymore and that if the ones we have now die they won’t be buying new ones. Reason why is probably because they believe that technology “corrupted” me and my brother. That means that my sisters can get trapped without any way of communicating with me or contacting me. They will be completely silenced and no one in the world will even know they exist. She told her that religious books are enough for them and my dad said that they don’t even need Khan Academy and free online education. This is going too far. My sisters will grow up to be uneducated and poor. They won’t be able to have a job and their parents will just keep them hostage and like prisoners. They were even saying that they have plans to move to another country. They can do whatever they want there, what if they force and pressure one of my sisters into an arranged marriage that she doesn’t want? They already said that it was a mistake why they let me and my brother take and pass GED, I guessed the reason is because it allowed us to have more independence and be able to have a job. Note: I don't have a job because I am female. I wanted to work but I know they will be furious and won't let me. They let my brother work only because he is male.

My father has already said a few times that he doesn’t want to end up in jail. But he did things in our lives that if anyone else did it they would end up in jail. The reason why I never called the police on him is because I was afraid that if the police left that he will kill me. And he may. He’s that type of man.

I don’t know what to do. If I call the police or cps what will happen to my sisters? I am only thinking of my sisters right now and I want them to be safe and to have a better life. I just want my sisters to be able to have a choice in their lives, if they want to be religious or not, not to be forced to be religious against their will and with threat of violence if they leave. I want them to have education and if one of them wants a job in the future that she can work. I don’t want them to be trapped and to be imprisoned by their own parents.

Yesterday (May 26th) my brother went outside and was outside all day (9 o clock in the morning till 5 o clock afternoon) as he wants to stay away and keep a distance from our parents as he wants to lessen the chance of a fight or argue happening. It’s better for him to be outside and he feels better when he isn’t home. I completely understand as I don’t like being here either. Sometimes in the morning my mom badgers him about prayer and asks him is he really praying, my brother just ignores her. As we all know in this country you have the right to pray in your own way and also to not even pray at all. My parents don’t care about that. My father said before that he has religious law in this house and the he doesn’t care about the government’s laws.

Well what happen when he came home at 5 yesterday? My mom and dad came into our room and started questioning him about his whereabouts. My mom again asked him does he pray. My brother ignored them at first. Annoyed by them and their questioning, he got out of our room and went into the kitchen. My father and mother followed him into the kitchen. My mom continued questioning him, but I haven’t heard the rest of the conversation and what everyone was saying as I was in the bathroom taking one of the cats to the litter. After I got out I immediately went to my room and locked my door as I noticed that things were getting tense and were about to possibly escalate to a fight. My gut feeling was right. When my mom asked him again where is he going and who is he seeing my brother told her that it’s none of her business. In reaction to this my mother became really angry and started yelling at him that he is Shaytan (the devil in Arabic) and called him a disbeliever and my father said that my brother is Iblees (another name for the devil in Arabic) and she started charging at him trying to punch him. My heart started pounding fast and I was about to call 911 again. My brother told her that if she attacks him that he will defend himself and attack back. My father told my brother that she is his mother and that she has the right to hit him. My father then tried to stop my mother from attacking my brother and was telling her to calm down. He said that if my brother fights back that he will kill my brother, and that if it weren't for the protection the police and government grants to my brother that he would kill my brother (for apostasy). Things ended there and then my brother went to my room. When he entered I locked the door and it’s still locked now today. I am not unlocking the door anymore and it will always stay locked. I am now typing this on my computer with the door locked.

What will happen to me and my siblings? How can I safely get out of here? How can I stop this? Are there any shelters we can go to? How do I get custody of my siblings? I have no recorded evidence except texts we sent to other people but I have no audio/video recordings. For a long time I held back against these people and never reported them to the police nor to anyone else. I was afraid, and that’s why I never told anyone about this. My father should’ve ended up in prison for choking me years ago. I don’t want to let things become even worse and that someone gets killed or ends up dead. I want to stop this right now.



TL;DR  My parents are hyper religious and suspect that my brother is an apostate and they hate why he goes outside and they think my brother has a girlfriend. They believe that apostates have to be killed. My father physically assaulted my brother for those reasons on May 15th. My mother attempted to physically assault him for the same reasons on May 26th and they both called my brother the devil. My brother never raised his hand first on them both and never attacked them physically first. I have many siblings and I am trapped here and we can’t move out. My father threatened that he will call the cops and report my brother as a missing person when he goes outside. I don’t know what to do and how to help me and my siblings. Me and my brother planned to move but the way things are will prevent us from moving, and I don’t want to leave my other siblings alone.

569,92,184,Boyfriend (21 M) of 8 months has been raping me (22 F) for a while now.,257.0,gqbhjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gqbhjw/boyfriend_21_m_of_8_months_has_been_raping_me_22/,83.0,1590444252.0,"This requires a bit of context. I have a history of sexual abuse as a child so I'm a bit more desensitized to the situation than I should be. Also as I type this out, he's asleep next to me, so I apologize if I'm not completely coherent.

I have been with my boyfriend for 8 months, and we were both virgins entering the relationship. He is my first real relationship, so the waters for this situation are already murky for me. Early on I told him about my childhood abuse, and he seemed empathetic. Now I'm worried I just revealed myself as an easy target. 

2 months into our relationship we started having sex. The first few times it was consensual. After a month, he wanted sex more often. 3 times a day was pretty normal, and I didn't put much of a fuss until it physically started to hurt after a few weeks. At this point I would look at him and say stop, no, etc. But I would be laughing the entire time. I'm guessing this made him think I was playing coy. I also didn't put up a fight, and after he forced himself inside of me for a few minutes, I'd pretend to like it to get it over with. 

He's socially awkward, not the best with non straightforward responses. This is just my speculation, but he's pretty into Hentai which has a lot of ""fucked silly"" situations, and I think I might have been playing into the trope. The ""no, no, I don't like it, oh no I'm cumming anyway!"" trope. My point is, it wasn't particularly violent rape. I didn't want it, but I also didn't struggle much, and I did pretend to like it after a few minutes. So I don't blame him much for this. It wasn't until he left me with bruises on my forearms and a massive tear inside my vagina that I finally fought back. And even then, I only got angry because he started watching porn while inside me. We had a massive fight (well, I screamed, he listened) and he seemed to feel so guilty when he realized he was raping me, and that I didn't actually like it. He sobbed, and had a panic attack at being told he was a rapist. But after the argument, I stayed because... well I don't want to be alone. And he said he would stop.

Well lock down happened and I'm stuck living with him since my family got the virus. About a month ago he started ignoring it when I said no again, but I really don't care all that much. He's a decent, attentive person all day except for twice or three times a day. But a week ago I confront him over the fact that he's kind of bordering rape. He cries again, says he will never hurt me again, he wants me to be happy. 

Yesterday was bad. I told him I didn't want sex after we had done it twice. He ignores me, and proceeds to do it anyways. It hurts like a bitch, but I play along until he finishes. I don't plan on making a big deal of it until he decides to infantalize me... It felt like I was child again, being molested. He was caressing my cheek, saying I did such a good job at taking him, he's so proud of me. He wanted to get me water, a snack, anything that would make me happy. This was somehow worse than just flopping next to me and taking a nap. And so I started crying and told him he raped me. And he starts crying and saying he keeps doing it because he assumes he knows me better than he does, so he thinks I'm playing coy. 

Well now I'm kind of stuck here in an apartment with him. And I'm stupid for getting myself in this situation, but I'm just trying to make the best of it. I can't go back home, my family is still positive with the virus. I have no friends, and the rest of my family is in another country. My question is, how can I tread these waters without causing waves. I don't want to go to an assault center, I'm fucking scared of it. I'd rather be raped at home, I'm used to it if I'm being honest. And I havent convinced myself to break up with him. I'm holding out hope he's just an idiot, not malicious. And if that's the case, how do I help him not rape me? That sounds so stupid, I feel so stupid writing this, but I have no one to talk to so I've barely worked out the situation in my own head. He isn't a bad person, I hope, just awkward and makes a lot of mistakes. He's usually nice, and for now I'm trying to make it work, at least until I'm able to safely get out of this situation.",2020.0,5.0,26.0,03:49:12,victim,

Please see my post history for more details.

I took the first step and reached out to my mom.

She said that he’s an alcoholic and needs helps, and it’s hard to do it on your own, and I should get him into AA or treatment.

One friend I texted never responded.

Another friend I texted said that he just needed a healthier outlet for his frustration (he is constantly saying he wants to kill our dog/slit her throat—but only when she is annoying him. Other times he is loving and kind).

Is reddit biased? I posted in narccistic abuse and they all agreed it was abuse. But people in my life have never told me it’s abuse. Even in college when he would scream at me infront of others or punch holes in doors—no one said anything.

My therapist hasn’t really said anything either. When I said he yells at me he questioned how loud the yelling was.

Am I crazy? Am I making this stuff up and everyone else can see it’s actually me who is the messed up one? My family will always say things to him like “well you know how she is... I don’t know how you put up with her...”

I’m so confused? Am I going crazy? Am I just making stuff up? Do people think I’m so messed up that I deserve this? I am relatively attractive, have a good job, graduated with honors... what is it about me that makes people think this is what I deserve or the best I can get? 

When I told my therapist about what he says about our dog, he just kind of says he has anger problems.

Maybe it’s because I’ve broken up with him and said this shit before, then gone back to him? And people are just sick of it? 

I have already spent most of this relationship thinking I was the sociopath or narcissist. I felt relief but terror when I came to the conclusion I wasn’t. Now I’m just confused.

Edit: I cried first at the hard truth and now at the kindness and support.

Yes I posted on the red pill women, and was not very nice—although they are the ones that claimed abuse first and I knew if they were saying it, I couldn’t hide anymore. I think it is normal to have conflicting views. And yes he is nerdy, shy, weak. I think it is his insecurity that makes him abusive. I will not delete that post or take it down, because I won’t apologize for being completely fucked in the head at the moment or utterly confused. That was my last grasp of hope to fix this thing and I guess it was necessary to post. I did buy the surrendered wife like they told me to .... I am laughing about that now. 

I bought a twin bed several weeks ago and am staying in a separate room with my dogs. I do not think he is physically violent, I really don’t, I’ve lived with him 8 years. He doesn’t punch stuff anymore. I am applying for jobs out of state and will take my dogs with me. I decided my parents house is not supportive and I’m not going there. My dad has anger issues and my mom is a recovered alcoholic schizophrenic so... fuck that anyways. I’m thinking about just cutting everyone out of my life and starting over. I’ve never chosen the people in my life. Friends and relationships.... they’ve always just happened to me and I’ve gone along with them.

My (30f) boyfriend (35m) of 2 years comments on how I dress and do my hair, it started about 7 months into the relationship. It's really hard to explain because individually the comments aren't that bad, but it's starting to build up and causing me anxiety. I've tried talking to him about it, but he says he's only trying to help and I make him feel bad saying I'm struggling with it. Am I making a big deal out of nothing?

He tells me when it's time to dye my hair or get it cut. Sometimes I'm overdue a week or two because I'm really not too bothered by this but he is. 

He said sometimes I look frumpy. He told me a top I like makes me look old. These comments made me cry. 

He says that im being stubborn if I won't stop wearing something he doesn't like because 'people in relationships do things like that for each other'. The thing is, I have stopped wearing a couple of things he said he doesn't like, but where do I draw the line! 

He doesn't like certain colours. For example I like green but he doesn't. So now I feel like I can't wear anything green. He doesn't like v -necks, now I can't wear v-necks. 

This is a weird one and I don't know how to explain it really - I can feel him silently judging me as he looks at me if we're about the leave the house, and it makes me uncomfortable.

He wants to go clothes shopping with me and I hate the idea, we've had a couple of mild arguments about this. I don't mind him being involved in 'sexy clothes' shopping etc because that's for both of us, but I don't even like going clothes shopping with friends, I mostly do it online. 

I can't leave the house if my shoes are dirty, I have to clean them first. Now I'm not a dirty person, I'm not talking about shoes covered in mud from a wet woodland walk, I'm talking about the normal scuffs and dirt you get on shoes. 

I have a couple of jumpers that are a little bobbley from age. I love them cos they are comfy for chilling at home. If I'm just popping to the shop for milk etc I might not change, but he doesn't like this so now I've had to promise they are 'indoor' jumpers only. 

I had to buy new socks because mine were not girly enough. I had a lot of black socks cos of work. 

He says I look really nice when we go out to parties etc and he just wishes I looked like that all the time. Thing is, I don't have time for that! Who does unless you're a stepford wife. 

There are more comments like the above, but as I'm sure anyone reading this has dozed off by now I'll leave it! I've spoken to family and friends about my dress sense, and none of them think there is anything wrong with it, and believe me, my mum would have told me the truth.

Tl;dr. Boyfriend is very involved and vocal about what I wear. I don't know if I should take a stand or just give in.

Edit/Update. 
Ok so I really wasn't expecting quite this reaction. I feel incredibly stupid and embarrassed now. I'm going to have a talk with some people I know who have professional experience regarding domestic abuse, tell them other stuff I didn't put on this post, and then I'll go from there.

David’s parents never really warmed up to me because they were still endlessly talking about David’s ex, let’s call her Ashley. Ashley was very abusive to David and then he left her. They have a son together and Ashley still to this day uses David’s parents as free babysitters because David and I don’t live in the same state as them anymore. 

When we got married, we eloped in a small park in the south and just wanted it to be an intimate thing. I had told my parents way prior to us getting married (they live across the country) that that’s what we were going to do. David was afraid his parents would judge him so he didn’t tell them - not even the day of, he said he wanted to tell them in person which was two weeks after the fact. When he told them, his mom burst into tears and yelled at me for being a rebound and that they thought he would date around more. 

Well two weeks after this explosion, we were out having a campfire, just me, David, and David’s dad. We were having a good time. Just a little backstory, David’s dad had cancer (he’s doing fine now), but he always had a habit of mixing up names. He’d call me David’s ex’s name all the time and I dismissed it because I know he didn’t mean to. Well David’s mom and sister came out to the campfire and then David’s mom started saying shit so David’s dad tried defending me, but he called me David’s ex’s name on accident. His mom and sister laughed at me. I was done so I left and David called me and asked me to come back. I said I couldn’t. He said that even though he was drinking, if I didn’t come back he would have to drive after me. I didn’t want him drinking and driving so I went back (manipulation, I know).

Well in April of 2018, I got pregnant. My husband is military and he got orders across the country, I was in the military too and had to stay there because that’s where I was stationed. So the pregnancy was spent alone. His family lived in the same city I was stationed but maybe saw me once or twice the whole pregnancy and stated that they didn’t invite me over because I was quiet. Of course I was quiet lol. 

Anyway, when our son was born, I spent my maternity leave with my husband across the country and had to finish out my last few months of active duty back in his hometown. In the 3 months I was there, they saw our son once and whenever they got my step son, I always asked if I could spend one on one time with him and they always said no because it was their time with him. David asked Ashley multiple times if I could get my step son every other weekend but she would never reply to him out of spite.

When I finally left his hometown, it was like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. But in June of 2019, my husband, his sister, and mom were in a group chat and David sent a pic of our son to them and David’s mom said, “he’s ugly and looks just like OP’s dad”. She forgot that David was part of the group message members. I didn’t find out she said this until a couple of months ago. And my husband wanted to take him to their house for Christmas last year! I just don’t get it. 

What should we do about his family?

573,96,190,I (30F) accidentally found out that my BIL (28M) hits my SIL (23F). My husband (30M) knows. What do I do?,23.0,gdwrb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gdwrb8/i_30f_accidentally_found_out_that_my_bil_28m_hits/,20.0,1588710176.0,"Hello. I don't have anyone to talk to about this so I was hoping I could get some advice from you lovely people. 

So my parents moved to Australia from a pretty rough, developing country. I'm Aussie through and through. My husband grew up in the same village that my parents are from, but moved to a big city and has pretty much left behind all of the sometimes backwards and misogynistic practices of the area. 

My husband's younger brother never left the village, and married a girl from the same village. They live a VERY traditional life. She elected to drop out of school at sixteen and marry my BIL at 18 (there was opportunity to study further but I'd be lying if I said she was encouraged to do so - people in the area kinda look down on women who are too educated or work). She wanted to be a SHAM and has two beautiful kids. My BIL never pursued higher education and works a trade job which supports them. As far as I could tell she was happy and confident about her chosen life path (she was close to her family and very much ingrained in the village lifestyle). 

While I get on with my SIL we're not close. We don't have much in common: I'm not nearly as religious as she is, I'm educated, I work, and I wear pants that would be considered immodest in the village. But she's never been cruel or unkind to me, and when we're together we will chat and chill quite happily. We've had more to chat about since I had a baby (she had two before hitting 23, I only just had mine at 30). 

This all started about three weeks ago when she messaged me and told me to ask my husband to check his messages. I obliged and when I asked him later what it was about he muttered something about his brother being an idiot, but seemed really agitated for the rest of the day. I left it because I figured if it was something important, or if it was something that really bothered him, he'd chat to me about it. 

Then yesterday my phone battery had run down so I took my husband's phone to take a video of my baby to send to her (what with covid we haven't had the chance to go back and introduce him to all his cousins). That's when the messages started coming, one after the other. 

I didn't actually open the chat, but what was appearing in the notifications told me enough. He had hit her again. She didn't know what to do. She wanted my husband to talk to him because he was the big brother (my husband is the oldest son in the family which holds some clout) and was really really upset.

I immediately put away the phone and didn't mention anything to my husband. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. There's a chance my husband will talk to my BIL, or fell his dad who, in typical village style, might go beat the shit out of my BIL (or might not because sometimes things like this gets rug swept). 

I know my husband probably hasn't told me about this because he's the type of person who will try to solve a problem before worrying me. I also come from a background of extreme physical abuse from the hands of my dad, which took years of therapy to sort, some of which resurfaced a bit when I had my child. My husband is an amazing man who once noticed me flinch when he used the word 'b-tch' (he was watching a sports game and was making a quip about the opposing team) and STOPPED USING THE WORD ALTOGETHER AROUND ME) so I know he's definitely not on my BIL's side. On the other hand it's possible he's trying to preserve his brothers reputation with me because there's a chance I'll have to see him at some point and my husband knows there's no way I'd be able to hide my disgust. 

I love my SIL even if we aren't that close and my heart is fucking breaking for her and her kids. She has no education, I don't know what her financial situation would be without her husband. Her mum died of cancer about three years ago and her family will probably encourage her to stay with my POS BIL because it would reflect better on their reputation. I don't think I'm close enough with her to broach the topic, and I don't want to force my husband into a conversation with me about the abuse when really there's not a lot I can do to help.

How should I navigate this in finding a partner?,7.0,gu0eda,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gu0eda/fears_of_never_being_wanted_because_of_family/,5.0,1590965376.0,"I am currently going through a breakup but this has made me think about my life situation and if I will ever find a partner who will want me regardless of it. I don’t know what I should do to have a person love me and want me while understanding where I come from.

Growing up there was a lot of physical abuse in the home from my father and my mom and I would switch off as victims. After college I moved out into a different city. The reason why I can’t cut out my family is because I’m a 1st gen immigrant and there are only 3 family members I know in the U.S. and if I cut them out I will be spending holidays and life alone. The third person is a cousin from my dad’s side so no help there.

The abuse has toned down over time but my dad still treats my mom like shit and out of the blue he will go back to old behaviors. My mom refuses to leave him because she is happy and the fighting is “normal”. She also makes enough to live on her own.

My ex is one of the 2 people I have ever confessed all this two and he gave his advice but then told me to never talk about it again and go to a therapist. The rest of the relationship he would go about pretending as if I never mentioned it. He didn’t stick around long enough to meet my family.

I know my family is not giving me real love and I guess I am looking for that to be filled by an S.O. But lately, I feel as though many people don’t want to be involved with such a background and the cards in life are stacked against me. I don’t even tell my friends this because I don’t want to make people feel awkward.

Is it possible for me to find someone who will love me regardless of the situation I’m in, or should I just give up on finding love because I will be a burden to someone else? I guess my plan is that when I get married I can slowly pull farther away from my family and keep them at a comfortable distance. How should I even go about bringing up the situation if I get another relationship?

We eventually got out of that situation a few years ago, when she was 14. It still effects us to this day, and I admit I was a bit slow in doing what I should have done. Now, however, we're in a better place (safety wise).

My daughter has had a boyfriend before for a short time, but other than that I dont know much else about her love life. A few weeks ago, she told me that she had been talking to this guy who she's really starting to like. It made me so happy to see her falling for someone, but after the fact I kinda forgot about it. Yesterday, I decided to ask her how things were going with them, and she told me she stopped talking to him. I asked why, expecting to hear that she wasn't connecting with him or that they were incompatible. But her answer was, ""he would probably turn out like dad"" and she just chuckled. I was a bit shocked at first, but asked her what she meant (or if he had displayed any aggressive behavior toward her) She said no but that ""They'll all turn out like that, so I don't think I want to date anyone"". 

After a bit more conversation, I found out that she ultimately really liked him, and so far nothing went wrong, but she got scared. I found out that the way her father treated us has her believing that every guy she meets will become abusive. Her view of males is not great, and I feel like it's my fault. She had said that she didn't want to end up like me, but I don't want that to be the reason she misses out on what could be great relationships. Throughout my awful marriage, she had witnessed what absolutely isn't the norm for a relationship. I failed her in that aspect, and my attempts to try to tell her that she shouldn't let my screwup be the example of what a relationship should be doesn't work. Considering she's technically an adult, I don't want to lecture her, but have an equal conversation. Does anyone know how I can go about this?

I’m a 26 year old white guy. I’ve been with my 23 year old black girlfriend for a year and a half. My family don’t know we’re dating because if they did, they’d likely disown me. They’re very racist. My parents don’t think black people should even be allowed to vote. They refer to them as the n word. They raised me and my siblings with those disgusting beliefs, and I’m the only one who grew to reject them. My most tolerant sibling thinks they should be allowed to have legal rights but thinks races shouldn’t *ever* mix. Yeah. They’re bad people. I’ve dated black and many other types of women under their noses. I don’t bring girls I’m dating to meet them and definitely not if they’re not white. I don’t want to subject myself or them to my family’s abuse if I don’t have to. 

I told my gf pretty early on about my family. She didn’t care that much because at the time we were more like friends with benefits than a couple. I have my own place so it wasn’t that hard to hide it. Now we’re serious together in love, so it’s caused problems. I wanted to marry her. I knew I couldn’t hide her forever, and I don’t want to. I’m proud to be with her and it’s time for me to act like it. The fact that she went this long putting up with my bullshit proves how much she loves me. I know I’ve been really selfish not to just come clean. So for the last month I’ve been thinking about how I will tell them about her. The thing is, I know they’re bad people, but they’re my family. I didn’t want them to just cut me out forever. I wanted time to think of a way to try to open their minds. I was hoping if I handled it right that maybe they’d learn to accept us.

Apparently I took too long, because my girlfriend just found out she’s pregnant with our first baby! It was a surprise that we’re so fucking happy about. Everyone in her entire family knows now while my own mother doesn’t know. This changes things. I was putting it off as long as I could but now I can’t avoid it. We’re moving in together, having a child, and probably getting married. I’m kicking myself for not informing them earlier to give them time to process just my relationship.

My girlfriend is very over my family. She’s mad I waited this long to tell them and I don’t blame her. I can’t ask her for advice on how I should tell them. She’s normally the person I’d go to.

I’m just gonna get right to it, my older brother sexually abused me starting from when i was 9 to when i hit puberty. When i was 14 i finally came out about it and cps was involved so obviously, he had to move out because i was still a minor and so on.

My parents rented him an apartment for awhile when they first found out what happened and also payed for all his medical bills (he had cancer) and they also hired him a lawyer when he went to court. I was a minor so I wasn’t allowed to go to court or represent myself, and I don’t think my parents hired anyone for me. They got me therapy after but i feel like its only because i legally have to or cps will take me away from them as per court orders. They never told any of our family and still talk about him to our family, even in front of me when i have privately asked them not to.

When he was going through cancer treatment the doctors were saying he probably wouldn’t make it, so my parents told me they wanted to bring him home for his last days if the treatment failed. At this point i had recently turned 15 and was put in the position of possibly letting my abuser move back in with us.

I understand that he is their son and I understand they will always deep down love him, but i am also their daughter and i feel like they are taking his side in this. The reason i never told anyone for so long (other than him threatening me) is because i felt like he was the favorite.

This year they bought him a brand new car (around 15k) and a small house.

I know i sound like a spoiled jealous brat, but i feel like I’m not asking for too much, I don’t want a super expensive dog or anything, and i already know how to train a dog myself so we won’t have to pay for training. I just want a companion, and honestly yes, i am jealous of my abuser. Because i feel like he is being treated better than me. 

Just generally it hurts me the way they act about him, when he did the things he did to me, and it seems like they don’t care.

Am i in the wrong to be jealous or feel entitled?

IS he being treated better than me?

When CoVid hit, he ended up quarantined with me. We never discussed living together, but it just happened. I mention this because I think it’s relevant to my feelings of “wanting to get away” from him. 

While he was living with me, he let his job go because he didn’t like it anymore, and he let the birding house he was living in go. So he’s homeless and jobless. I understand it’s hard to look for work right now, but he doesn’t even try for unemployment. 

Anyway, a few months ago he started to become very mean to me. Like screaming and yelling during arguments, being short tempered, and just rude to me. I think he must be feeling bad about not working and stressed out about CoVid. I also think he might have undiagnosed mental health issues. 

I keep waiting for him to make an effort on his mental health and his financial independence, but he just doesn’t . 

And when we try to talk about it, he gets angry. 

I’m trying to be understanding of the fact that depression could be a huge catalyst to this as well.

I think I reached my breaking point a few times and tried to break up, but he just cries and I stay with him so he can stop crying. 

I don’t know what to do. Should I stay and support him until he becomes financially independent and gets help for his mental health?  I think I’d those two things are addressed, we could have a great relationship.

Because of how badly it's still affecting me, I thought it was time to tell my husband so I would have someone to talk about it with.

I asked my mothers opinion first, and she thinks I should wait till I see a counsellor (I should be starting within a month but who knows with the corona virus) and talk with them about the situation instead, or ask the counsellor if I should tell my husband.

My husband & brother have a great relationship, and I understand not wanting to do anything that will ruin that. Its just really hard having something so heavy weighed on my mind and bringing me down, & not able to talk to my favourite, most supportive person in the world about it.

Should I tell my husband or wait till I get to speak to a counsellor about it?

Side note - my brother & I do have a great relationship now. He was in a pretty dark spot back then and has since become an amazing person. With the more recent traumatic events I have faced, he was an absolute rock in my life and temporarily stayed with me at my house so i wouldn't be alone (husband is a trucker). Althought I love & trust him and we have an awesome relationship, I still get fear when he sleeps over and cant sleep without locking my bedroom door and also blocking it with another object. I do not want to cause any problems in mine or my husband's relationship with my brother; I just don't want to keep it from my husband anymore. Any advice is appreciated.

*Edited to add - the more recent traumatic events I went through was a major surgery to remove a 20lb tumour, and shortly after I was diagnosed with cancer. My mother & brother were incredibly helpful through all of it, taking care of me and doing everything they could to help. I need all the help & support I can get during this time, which is why I don't want to ruin that relationship with them.

***UPDATE***

I told my husband tonight. He reacted really well. There was no anger for me hiding it from him, he just wished I had told him sooner so he could help me. He said all the right things and comforted me perfectly. I feel so much better now. He think it's terrible what they did to me, but doesn't hold resentment against my brother or mother, so that helped like crazy knowing it wouldn't change the relationships. He agrees that my brother should still get professional help, so we plan on pushing to get that done. 

Thank you so much for all the responses. I was taught that what my brother did was normal, and only recently started to realize that what I was led to believe is WRONG. I so appreciate you taking the time to help me.

To the people accusing me of being a shitty person for hiding this from my husband; he knows absolutely everything about my traumatic past but this, including my 3 other sexual assault experiences. The only reason I never talked with him about this was because I was led to believe this was normal, and shouldnt be talked about with other people. My husband totally understood and there was no reason to make me feel shitty for it.

Also, I realize it sounded contradicting saying my brother & I have a good relationship now yet I feel the need to barricade my door when he sleeps over. It's only when I go to bed that these thoughts & fears come back; I never experience it when hanging out with him during the day.",2020.0,3.0,20.0,17:55:19,victim,21

We live together, have bills together, and I don’t have any other family so breaking up would be really complicated and I do love him so I want to give it a chance.

Recently she got some physical problems that have lasted ~8 months. My parents and her doctors are convinced it's factitious. She doesn't know they think this. 

She goes to a therapist often who doesn't seem to think her problems are very severe, she hasn't ever been medicated for any mental problems and it hasn't been brought up. 

Over the last two months or so she's started getting more physical. I've posted before about how she throws away my personal items when I don't leave our shared bathroom as she likes it, and how she once poured toothpaste on my pillow when she was mad at me. And how she choked me for wanting my (not shared) room to have the window open at night. 

More recently however, she's started having screaming fits, throwing things at me, trying to sleep outside while it's below freezing, getting mad at everyone post fit for not handling it how she'd prefer.

And just now, she wanted me to go outside to the car to get something she wants from it since she didn't have shoes on. I didn't either so I refused which made her throw a (pencil pouch?) at me, punch me in the glasses (I haven't checked if they're broken yet), grab my neck like scruffing a dog, and put her hand in my mouth to pull my cheek/lips as far away from the rest of my head as possible. Since it's winter and my lips have been chapped for a while, they're all torn and bleeding now. She thinks the entire altercation is my fault for ""not being a kind person"" and I asked her, she thinks she ""doesn't need to be kind"". 

I just don't know what to do. There's no one I can talk to since my parents have been babying her since she got sick. My mom is concerned about me being hurt of course but won't punish my sister or tell her therapist or even try to keep her away from me. I can't see my counselor cuz school is canceled for the next 2 months and as the decently healthy non mentally ill child, it's not worth putting any money into my wellbeing.

Is it possible for me to stop getting hurt by her? At this point her beatings are nearly daily and chances are it'll only get worse. I just feel so hopeless. It's not like I can call the cops on her. No one tells me anything about why she's like this. They won't tell me her diagnosis. They won't tell me her therapist (so I can't tell her myself, not that she'd believe me)

First time poster here, I apologize in advance for any mistakes as english is not mine nor my autocorrects first language

When I (21f) was a kid my mother used to treat me horribly. I cannot remember that much but during the age of 7-10 we would get into fights frequently. I dont know why or about what. 

During one of these fights I ran away and tried to close my door but she grabbed my arm. To this day, more than 12 years later I still have scars on my arm. She used say horrible things later on as I got older, like no one would ever love me bevause I am that horrible
It often feels like she hates me having a different life than her, going to College far away.
I do not know if I can ever forgive her for her treatment of me. We talked about ist recently and its like she does not realise what she did. But no matter how many times I ask her not to do something, it always stops for few weeks and then she forgets.

Throwaway for obvious reasons. My boyfriend \[22M\] and I \[19F\] have been together for about 6 months. I go to college out of state, and he lives in that state (which is across the country from where I am now). Since we have started dating, he has had problems with trusting me. I wasn't allowed to stay up later than him, be on snapchat/instagram/discord, go to my friends' houses (near campus), turn off my phone while studying, or take a nap without being accused of cheating on him. Note that I have never been unfaithful in our relationship, and every single time I am accused of these things, I send him screenshots of my snapchat best friends and recents, my recent DMs on instagram, my call history, and my recent text messages. Each time I followed a new account on instagram, or when someone new followed me, he would ask me who they were, how I knew them, and in some cases messaged those people and asked them how they knew me. When I was with my friends from school, he made me send a video of everyone who I was with and called me frequently and I would answer as much as I possibly could (there was one specific instance when I was studying with two of my female friends in one of their dorms and he called me 34 times in two hours. I only picked up and talked to him four of the times since we were busy studying and he said that, because I wasn't answering the other 30, there must have been someone else there).  Regardless of how many times I did these things to try to prove my innocence to him, we were having a fight each and every day that started with him accusing me of cheating on him or talking to other guys. I really made an effort to try to limit situations from which he could draw these conclusions -- I would be sure to close all the way out of apps like Snapchat that said when I was most recently online and not use them unless I was talking to him. I stopped using discord, and, in turn, talking to my very close-knit group of online friends who I have known since I was 11. I stopped going out with my friends at college, instead spending time with him. I limited studying so I could always be available to him.

On top of this, I have been struggling with a resurgence of my Major Depression since last November (we started dating in December). I was missing classes whenever I could justify it, not doing my work, self-harming and thinking about suicide every single day. I have since started therapy and been put on medications.

Flash forward a few months to quarantine. I had to move out of my dorm since I was still living on campus during my second year. He helped me move out and it was the last time that I remember him as the guy who I fell in love with. We spent one last weekend together before I shipped off back home across the country. This is when his jealousy started to take over. The accusations of me cheating increased exponentially. Because of the time difference, he was waking up around 3-4am my time. Because of my new medications, I was having a lot of trouble sleeping and he would call me every single morning to wake me up with another accusation of me cheating on him. He would ask me why I was up later than him (which was explained by the time difference and my having trouble sleeping). He would screenshot my snapchat score and keep a log of every single time it went up and how much it increased by. He made me cut off contact with some of my friends and then would still accuse me of going behind his back and talking to them. Instead of making me send videos of my friends, he made me send him videos of my family when I said that I was spending time with them. When he was angry at me for any of these things, he would say things just for the purpose of hurting me (ex: telling me he was going to go fuck his coworker to get back at me, telling me I am like his ex-girlfriend who he refers to as ""satan,"" telling me that all of the problems in his life are my fault and that I don't deserve to be happy because I am an evil person). You can imagine that he was just reinforcing the thoughts that I was already having because of my depression. I have been in a situation like this one before and I know that I need to get out. 

At this point, it is important to mention that, while I have never told him a lie, no matter how small, he has lied to me multiple times. When he was screenshotting my snapchat score, for the few weeks of him doing this, he was saying that it was just his phone messing up and that he was accidentally screenshotting our chats. He then told me that he was lying about this and that he was really screenshotting me score. He also told me that he would never go through my phone without my permission, but he did. He told me a couple days later. When I was upset about both of these lies he said something along the lines of ""Well at least I told you, I know that you're hiding plenty of lies from me so if anything you should be thanking me.""

About a week ago, he calls me at 4am and tells me that he is breaking up with me, saying that we are ""different people"" and that he will never understand why I want to be friends with anyone but him. This broke my heart because I do really love him, but a small part of me was relieved. Then he told me that he wanted me back, that he can't live without me, and that if I don't take him back, he would kill himself. This terrified me. While I know that it wouldn't be my fault, I still care about this person and don't want him to kill himself. I wouldn't have believed him, but he talked often about depression and suicide and had a very detailed plan of how he wanted to do it, which involved taking his dog and his gun and driving out of town, abandoning/killing her, and then turning the gun on himself. This is when I found out that he had told me another lie. Because of his depression, I told him to please tell me if he was going to buy a gun (he has a CCW and talks about guns often). Of course, as I should have suspected, he had bought one weeks before this without telling me until just then.

I told him I had to think about it. I knew that I didn't want to get back with him but I was so scared of him hurting himself that it was making me reconsider. I begged him for space during this time, and he told me he would give it to me, but he was still calling me every single morning at 4AM and calling me multiple times throughout the day and then getting mad at me if I didn't pick up. He told me that I have to make a final decision. I said that my decision was to end it, and he said ""okay then I'm going to go do what I have to do. This just shows me that you never loved me"" Of course, the ""thing he had to do"" was how he referred to killing himself. He has some of my things that I couldn't take back with me from school, and he said he would destroy them before killing himself. I started crying, having a panic attack (which I have been having more and more since I have been home from school), and trying to convince him not to hurt himself.

Then he said, ""T'm going to give you one more night to decide. I know that this is hard on you, and I'm sorry for that. I just want to make it as easy on you as possible. I'm going to go to sleep right now, and in the morning I will read your answer when I wake up. If you say that you want to give me another chance, then we will take it slow. If you say that you don't, i'll just tell you I love you, and then be on my way.""

Like an idiot, I actually fell for this. While he was sleeping, I thought about it some more and decided to stick with my intuition and break up with him. I sent him a very very long paragraph explaining that I need time to work on being the best version of myself that I can be, and that I barely have the motivation to stay alive myself, and that if we were to try again I would only end up hurting him.He told me to ""shut the fuck up,"" that ""I never loved him,"" that he is going to ""burn all of my shit that's at his place,"" and ""go fuck his coworker before he kills himself."" He was begging me to give him another chance. He was saying that, to prove that I ever loved him, I would have to give him another chance. He kept repeating that if I ever loved him, I would be giving him a second chance, period. 

Finally, he wore me down and I said that I would give him another chance. He said ""good, that's what you should be doing."" This pissed me off. I went back through our conversation and read the words he said to me and it made me more and more angry. I told him how pissed I was. I told him to leave me alone for the rest of the night, which he surprisingly did.

I woke up the next day and had therapy for the first time since all of this breakup mess started. I told my therapist that my boyfriend has been controlling and threatening suicide, and he agreed with me that I need to get out to have time to heal myself. Immediately after my FaceTime therapy session, I called my boyfriend and told him this. I told him that I just can't do it anymore. He hung up on me. I went to go spend some time with my mom (for 15 minutes) and he called me 8 times even though I was telling him that I couldn't answer. When I left my mom, I called him back and he said ""you're a horrible person."" I tried telling him I love him and that this is for the best, but he interrupted me and told me to ""shut the fuck up."" He is luckily at a friend's house right now, but he told me that he is going to kill himself if I don't take him back again. I stood my ground and told him that I still want to break up, and he hasn't said anything since then.

I feel trapped. I feel like I am deciding between my life and the life of a loved one, and this is so painful. Every time I try to leave him, he doesn't stop talking to me. He threatens suicide and reminds me of how horrible of a person I am.

tl;dr: my suicidal boyfriend is extremely controlling and jealous and whenever I try to leave he threatens suicide and continues contacting me and I don't know what to do.

EDIT: for some more context, he doesn't have a good relationship with his parents. He is currently living with his older cousin and her fiance. I already had messaged her and his best friend saying that I am worried about him being suicidal.

I am new to reddit. Sorry for the wall of text, but I would like to depict the dynamic. My family: dad (58M), mom (50F), two brothers (23M and 30M) and me (20F). I will call my younger brother (23M), John.

John and Dad: My dad has always supported and provided, never demanding anything from John, despite him playing videogames all day with only a promise to return to graduate school after failing the first semester. John continually brings up a lack of his attention and blames mishaps on him at every opportunity. On multiple occasions, he has verbally threatened to end my dad’s life.

John and Mom: My mom bends to his whims, constantly pushing the family to be patient, with the intention of him being well-behaved. She’s the only person John’s willing to occasionally talk to, but still displays disrespect for dominance.

John and older brother (30M): My older brother has helped John through undergrad and acceptance into graduate school, though John claims sole responsibility. It is not rare for John to punch my brother; to avoid escalation, my older brother does not reciprocate.

John and Me (20F): He has to know where/what I’m doing at all times, and berates me for the smallest things, while name-calling. When we argue, he goes on tangents on how I’m gonna rot in hell for getting mad. Just today, he demanded to download his music onto my phone, and slapped me when I refused.

John and the public: Quiet and shy, yet defensively angry when pointed out. Claims of many friends, yet never goes out.

Overall, there are moments I feel unsafe to be in the same household as him, when he has his outbreaks. He constantly points out each member’s previous mistakes, swears, and insists he’s better/right. Nothing seems to please him. At times, he claims suffering from sleep deprivation, fatigue, being misunderstood, but at other times claims enjoyment from the arguments.

Attempted solutions: Moving out is not within my means, and I would prefer not to run away from my familial problems. John refuses any visits to doctors/therapists.

I'm not sure how to even start to handle this. I don’t want to continue to see my family breaking apart; this brings tears to my eyes. I want a happy, united family.

Basically, they mentally mistreat her 90% of the time she interacts with them. She also told me they used to beat her when she was little, and now they deny it.  They make fun of her and whenever something happens ex. all the pizza's are gone overnight, she is obviously the one to blame.  

Not her socially incompetent 26 year old (mentally 11) half brother. (lets call him S)  She now barely eats because she is scared to go downstairs, whenever she leaves her room she gets starred at by S  (in a creepy way) or gets yelled at by her parents for taking all the food (oh did I mention she barely eats enough and is starving at this point?).  

Her parents are the reason for her depression, anxiety and insecurity. When she has a panic attack (literally on the ground unable to do anything) they call her a drama queen whilst S just watches and smiles. They always act like she's not good enough, and she's like one of the best students on her school. 

Whenever she did something really well, they always told her ""could be better"" which slowly built up to an insecurity.  

They also ""gaslight"" her, as I already mentioned they deny ever beating her. Whilst she clearly remembers being hit for misbehaving.

She was in a car with her mother, and their conversation has lead into her talking about having suicidal thoughts. Unlike a normal parent, who would attempt to calm their child down. She said something along the lines of ""Oh well il'l just crash the car, if that's what you want!"". And denies ever saying that, I find this very inhumane and simply not right.  

Her mother also found out she was doing something that is rather embarrassing (I wouldn't want to go into details), and shared it with S and her father. They all laughed at her and humiliated her.

They always make her feel guilty for everything whenever they are in an argument and I quote ""I gave you *life* and *raised* you, bought you so many *presents* and *loved* you, and this is the respect we get in return?"" they clearly never showed her any parental love aside from buying stuff for her. And never actually moved a finger to raise her.  

If it was not for me she would have already taken her life, she is very suicidal and she thinks she is losing her sanity. I'm very worried it might end up badly.

It all boils down to her saying her feelings aren't being validated because her partner doesn't share the same vegan values, but I feel pretty hurt because its not a black and white issue for me. I feel like she doesn't validate my belief that humans have a right to be part of the life cycle and consume meat.
She just keeps bring up that ""someday we'll need to be on the same page about food"", meaning she wants me to convert to veganism. She says she doesn't know how much longer she can be with someone who doesn't share her core values.
How do I show her that I have a different lifestyle? How do I convince someone I eat every meal with that my diet is just as important to me as her vegan values are to her?

TL;DR: vegan girlfriend shames me for buying low quality meat, wants me to convert to veganism",2020.0,5.0,23.0,03:34:22,victim,

I came out to my sister about her husband harassing me when she was going through her divorce with her husband a year or two ago.. When i was around 9 - 12 years old, he used to act extremely inappropriate with me. I finally told my sister a year or two ago about what he used to do. She acted like she cared and that she believed me for a while. 
I’m 20 now and this was a year or two ago. Now, she is pregnant with her second child and decides to get back with him... knowing what he did to me.... 
When my mom told me she was pregnant again with him, I nearly threw up and wanted to die.. I’ve never felt this betrayal and this sort of pain before.. especially coming from my own sister. 
It took me so much out of me to finally come out and say something but now it’s been brushed under the carpet.
Anyways, my other siblings and my mom still hangout with her AND him. I don’t live at home, so I don’t have to face her. I don’t know if I should say anything to them but I feel like my issues were never taken seriously... this issue has been tearing at my soul and my heart. I feel like this is a big nightmare and I’m just waiting to wake up.. 
any advice on how to deal with this.?",2020.0,3.0,22.0,14:45:38,victim,12
593,116,219,My brother (6) tried to stab my step-dad.,3.0,gn8gww,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gn8gww/my_brother_6_tried_to_stab_my_stepdad/,9.0,1589996831.0,"So for a bit of background, my brother and sister (8) have the same dad (one in the story) I’m 18 with a different father and then obviously we have the same mum. Mum is a keyworker working a 12 hour shift for 3-5 days a week so most of the time the kids are with their dad. I moved out just before lockdown and I’m isolating with my bf, my mum told me about the incident and the rest is my own input and experience.

Now for some time we’ve all suspected that my brother could have some mental issues, it took him a very long time to talk and he continues to struggle with his emotions, learning and interacting with other people. He is prone to enormous meltdowns and the only person who can calm him is my mother. He barely uses the toilet and screams and screams if he can’t go to bed with a nappy. We’ve tried to get him diagnosed so he can have some additional help but it’s just been impossible. We suspect ADHD but can’t be sure. There’s an enormous wait list for kids to get looked at, so we tried through the school but that didn’t work out either. 

So any kid in a normal situation with something like this would be struggling enough, but with the added stress of lockdown and being stuck with my step dad I think it’s pushed him to his limit. I HATE my step dad, and it’s not that typical dislike between a step dad and daughter, I never knew my own dad so have no one to compare him to. The first few months we all moved in together were fine until my mum had my sister (she was already pregnant when we moved in) then from there it’s been a 9 year rollercoaster down hill. Step dad was a 32 year old virgin with no experience with kids and very rarely socialised. After my mum had just given birth to my sister, my dad says ‘maybe we should have another one’ because he wanted a boy. He’s always been horrible to my sister, screams at her if she doesn’t do something the second he says it, if she talks back he’ll smack her or grab her arm and drag her around. The worst of this began after my brother was born and he’d always side with my brother over every little argument between them both. My brothers been spoilt and is now acting out and witnessing the hate and anger that he received from my sister and now receives from my step dad and it’s all one big ugly cycle. I’m so disappointed with my mum, how she stands by and lets it happen. She’ll tell my dad off after for being so horrible to them but it makes no difference. She doesn’t tell him to stop when he’s doing it and won’t throw him out. Ever since they got married she complains to me about him and not thinking he loves her. Yet as soon as we even suggest she leave him it’s an excuse, I won’t be able to get by financially, who’s gonna look after the kids etc. I’ve offered solutions around this but she won’t listen. Oh and also she isn’t being abused, she’s a black belt in martial arts so he wouldn’t dare hit my mum so he takes any anger out on them.

Anyway getting back to the original plot, yesterday wasn’t even that bad, there were the usual arguments and my dad screamed at my brother. Something must have flipped because he’d gone into the kitchen, (which wasn’t too unusual he usually goes in there to calm down) but goes in the drawer and grabs two knives, confronts my dad and tells him he could stab him. 

He didn’t, he got the knives off of him and probably screamed a lot at him causing more frustration and anger. But this isn’t right? My brother is starting to show psychotic tendencies and I’m bloody terrified, mostly for my sister. They’re always fighting and she isn’t much bigger than him despite the two year age gap. What the hell happens if he makes the same threat to her? But we can’t get him any help, she can’t get away and my mum won’t throw my step dad out!!! I feel so guilty for moving out but I don’t think I could have coped. If I ever stood up to him I’d be isolated from the outside world, my phone taken off me and made to look after the kids. Probably would have ended up stabbing him myself ha. I just don’t know what to do, my sister seems to be the only one in that family I can save..",2020.0,5.0,20.0,23:32:11,victim,18

But, yesterday was a come to Jesus moment, but I wondered how it compares to other’s opinion. And i’m also hopeful that you will read until the end to understand what I think is gaslighting.

My partner and I live together and are rarely apart, but we maintain 2 apartments. He has his own (won’t allow my name on it) and I have my own (he refuses to be listed on mine).  

I drove 3 hours yesterday to spend the weekend and “his/our” apartment because i didn’t have my son this weekend. He is on call for work.

When I arrived I ordered food and picked it up - -paid for it and walked in. He just got done working out. He asked why I looked “so weird” when I arrived.

I let it go…told him I was not “weird”. He asked if I had been drinking. (his common default because I used to drink a few glasses a day and he called me an alcoholic). I had NOT been drinking.  

I sat and started eating. My watch notification went off and he asked what it was. It was an alert from “his” city news saying there were riots breaking out due to protests. I read it and said there are fires too. He said what? I said there are fires too — he said it doesn’t say that there. I said it doesn’t matter, I just saw a bunch of video of fires downtown. He said I was being “sensational and extremely and full of shit”. I said what are you saying? There are fires breaking out .. he said that I was full of shit and that he was sick of my constant demeaning of “his city”. (since my apartment is in another city — he likes to believe there is a competition.

Somehow this just BLEW UP. He started in on me as that he’s sick of my attitude. That his city is way better than mine and he’s sick of my city. He then launched off about how I am just trouble every time I arrive and that i’m sick in the head. 

Then he showed me he just hooked up a camera in his apartment and said he’s really glad I am displaying this behavior in front of the camera. I said WHAT? I simply showed you a news alert and somehow you are blowing this up?

He then went on about how he will never let me have access to these cameras in his apartment because he needs this “evidence” for the future. Then said “and you wonder why I don’t want to marry you…”

I started to cry. But I stopped myself. I walked into the bedroom to work from there. I wasn’t going to listen to this anymore. He came in and said “I just finished a book and it describes you to a ’t’ ….NARCISSIST> YOU ARE SICK!”  

I just put my head down and started working and ignored him. It got worse. He kept screaming at me. I told him not to yell at me. That i simply showed him a news alert and I didn’t deserve this. He said that I made the “fire part” up. That the riots were peaceful and that I was being extreme and I was a hater. I said there was a FIRE there. I tried to show him the video but he told me i was insane. (who cares?!?) 

So I stayed quiet. He kept saying and you wonder why I refuse to marry you.  

I just held in the tears and stayed quiet. He went to watch tv and then kept saying …so you aren’t coming to watch tv with me? It’s friday night and this is the punishment I get? I don’t deserve this shit.  

I ignored him. I eventually went in there and watched TV and didn’t even really speak.  

I woke up this am and I siad I’m sick. I don’t want to come out to do anything with him. I told him I feel sick and i’ve been on my laptop all day working here. He keeps saying “so interesting that every time you come here…you want nothing to do with me… what is WRONG with you?”  

I’ve ignored it. 

I AM NOT OK. I am Sad. I can’t tell him. I can’t do anything. I am just trying to avoid him and I’ve sadly been sitting her planning my exit. 

“now you know why would i want to MARRY you?!”  Said i’m a narcissist?  I am just trying to swallow this stuff.  think it’s clear - he’s horrible to me and doesn’t want anything to do with me. 

He also said that I just hate that everyone loves him -- and I can't take that.  That EVERYONE loves him and that they stay away from him because he's with me.

But today -- he's acting as if everytihng is FINE and wanting to know why I won't go paddle boarding with him??",2020.0,5.0,31.0,08:25:18,victim,

Our beautiful baby girl was born in February of this year after a devastating miscarriage. Throughout our relationship he has struggled with alcoholism. He has done some very horrible things to me while drinking. He became verbally and emotionally abusive, and disgustingly disrespectful towards me. I had a high risk pregnancy, and the stress his drinking and abusive behavior caused became too much and I left after one particularly horrible night. I was heavily pregnant, and I couldn’t take it anymore. He saw the pain he was causing me and realized something had to change. In December 2019, he stopped the drinking and vowed to be sober for a year before even thinking about or trying to drink socially. He wanted to do it for himself, our relationship, for me, but most importantly for our daughter. I told him that if he broke his promise and started drinking again, I would have to leave. Despite my love for him, I couldn’t go through it again and I would not let our daughter go through it. He proposed to me soon after and I accepted. He did so well and I had my best friend back. 
Today, after nearly six months of being sober, he decided that he wanted to drink again. His excuse was that it was a nice day and that he was bored. The memories of nights when he drank came flooding back and I completely broke down. I practically begged him not to do it; I asked him to spend time with me instead. I told him that I would have to pack up myself and my daughter and leave him if he decided to drink again. We have been down this road before. It starts with a few beers and eventually becomes a huge problem. I can’t expose my baby girl to that. He bought the beer anyway and headed to his friend’s house. He said that I was overreacting and trying to control him, and that I shouldn’t leave him over a few beers. I’ve packed a bag for myself and my daughter; I’m planning to leave tonight but this is breaking my heart. He’s a good man and I love him so much, I just can’t go through the pain his drinking causes again, and I especially don’t want my baby girl to go through it either. He made a promise to me and now he has not only broken his promise, but also my trust in him. I know I’m ranting and I apologize if this is hard to follow. I don’t know if I’m asking for advice or encouragement; I just feel so broken and lost right now.

Edit - this all happened yesterday. Today he, again, told me that I overreacted and that I was being ridiculous. I tried to explain that his decision to drink again was only a small part of the problem. The bottom line is that I feel disrespected. He acts as if my thoughts, feelings, and opinions are insignificant. He said that if I left he was going to try to get custody of our child. In addition to his alcoholism he works six days a week, and I let him know that I would allow him to see our child whenever he wanted; he would always have access to her. No matter how I feel about him, I would never keep our daughter away from him, she would just be living with me.

I was the only woman there. I was barely spoken to the entire time and I could not follow their conversation as their workplace has an extreme amount of jargon. They were all getting very drunk, I only had one drink as I was to drive my boyfriend home.

Once we were done, my boyfriend said that he could tell I was upset and I let him know that yes, I would have liked to be included. 

As I was driving on the highway home, he became more and more irrational. Virtually screaming at me as I was driving 100km/h on the highway. He unbuckled his seatbelt as I was driving and made to get out of the car, which caused me to freak out. At a stop light, he virtually got out of the car. The shoulder of the road was too small for me to pull over so I drove for like five minutes to take the nearest exit, crying my eyes out. 

I phoned him like 10 times, but he wouldn’t answer. Thinking he had blocked me, I phoned his brother and he didn’t answer either. I messaged him and explained what had happened. I asked if my boyfriend had contacted him at all, as I was worried. My phone was about to die so I went home to get my charger, and then drove around for about two hours looking for him. With no success, I went home again and just sat in the car crying. After about 10 mins of that, he showed up. 

He broke up with me, swore at me, and made me feel really uncomfortable. The next morning, he didn’t remember much and was really apologetic. I decided to forgive him. I told him that I messaged his brother and he got pretty upset with me.

His brother messaged me that morning and asked for all of the details. I told him virtually everything that was said. He wants to confront my boyfriend if something like this ever happens again. He promised me that he wouldn’t tell anyone else about what I confided in him, and thanked me for doing so. 

Here is where I think I’m an asshole: I was reading an article about emotional abusers and one of the characteristics is to turn family against the victim. That was not my intention. I moved to be with my boyfriend from a different province, so I have virtually 0 friends here. I don’t speak to my parents much so I didn’t want to talk to them either. I honestly thought that maybe my boyfriend called his brother to pick him up or something. I only told his brother because I was extremely overwhelmed, upset, and hurt. I didn’t know what to do. My boyfriend was drunk and got out of the car on a highway in the dark. I was absolutely terrified. 

It’s been about two weeks, and my boyfriend keeps bringing up the fact that I told his brother and that it upset him. 

Keeping that fact in mind, and with the article that I read online about abusers, did I do something wrong? Should I apologize to my boyfriend for telling his brother?",2020.0,6.0,5.0,20:49:24,victim,22

For context, I (23F) was sexually abused by my father as a child. He was an alcoholic predator that would beat my mother in front of my older brother (I was too young to remember) He would go to his family and claim he was the one being abused. He was a manipulator. My mum eventually gained enough bravery to leave. But she didnt ever take away my choice to see him. I wish she did, and I know she wishes she did too. 

As a child I wanted him in my life. I couldn't understand why my parents weren't together and I didn't understand why my mum looked sad whenever she spoke of him. I gave him so many chances to be my dad. That's all I wanted. I'd go see him on the rare occasion. But eventually I gave up trying. 

I got to the age of 14 and started having flashbacks when I slept. The same dream every night. I won't go into details but it was something a father should never be doing with his child. I stayed silent for a year until I told my best friend. And she convinced me to tell my mother. Turns out he was accused of the same thing when I was a kid and that's why I wasn't allowed to see him for a while. My older brother finally admitted that Dad had done things to him as a child too. 

We kept this information to ourselves for a few years until my brother and I finally confronted him. Just keep in mind that I was telling myself he didn't do it. It was me that was sick and twisted for even imagining it. It took all my courage to get my words out but I finally asked the question. His response? ""Was I drunk?"". We went back and forth arguing for what felt like forever until my brother said he'd kill him if he didn't leave. The last thing my dad ever said to me was ""I'm sorry"". We called the police and gave our evidence.

We had been waiting for 3 years. Finally got given a trial date for May of this year. Until covid happened and it got pushed back another year. I'm feeling so angry and it feels like I've lost my voice. People are never going to know what he was. They're going to mourn a monster. Justice will never be served. I don't know how to process this. I don't feel sad. And that in itself is fucking me up enough. I don't care that my dad is dead. In a way I feel free and content knowing he can't hurt anyone else. Am I a terrible person? How do I accept this?

Edit: I want to thank everyone for taking the time to reassure me and give me advice. You have no idea how much I appreciate it. My family didn't know what to say and it's been so great to hear from people that can relate or offer me some advice.",2020.0,5.0,28.0,01:52:04,victim,23

Sensitive topics.,57.0,gwymqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gwymqv/my_grandmother_keeps_allowing_my_abusive_mother/,32.0,1591364218.0,"Let me start this off by saying this is my first reddit post I've ever made. My girlfriend suggested I try reddit for some advice on this. Truly sorry in advance for how lengthy this may get.

So.. I grew up raised by my grandmother. My father packed up his things and left with my half-brother and moved to a different state without telling anyone where/why when I was four. That took a toll on my mental health early on. I was nearly mute for around a year following this.

I endured many different types of abuse from my mother. I only found out recently that she had been letting men touch me when I was an infant. When I was ten, she allowed men to take turns satisfying themselves however they wanted to with me. My grandmother was unaware of it all. During all of this, she would have boyfriend after boyfriend, each as scummy as the last. She's an alcoholic, and back then, she was a drug addict as well. Her boyfriends were too.

Other abusive behavior I endured: Yelling/screaming, physically harming me and my grandmother, name-calling, shaming, and many, many times of her telling me she never wanted me.

She would always make it well known that I was the kid who ruined her chances at a good life, and that was how I viewed myself growing up.

When I was twelve, her boyfriend (let's call him J) molested me as I was exiting the shower. We have a garage shower, and I liked using that one because I didn't have to walk past her room to get to it. As J was in the middle of... his attempt, my mother slammed the door to the garage open, saw what was happening, and said, ""DepressedDeermoth! What are you *doing* with my boyfriend?!"" The scariest part was that J did not smell like alcohol and his eyes were clear... he was a fully sober 25-or-so man willingly trying to have sex with a 12-year-old girl. This incident made me absolutely sure that I would never have a normal relationship with my mother. Until this point, I was hoping somewhere and somehow I'd have a friendship with my mom again. You've only got one, y'know? But this ruined it for me.

There's much more I could add to this but it's getting long already.. so I'll get to the part I needed advice on.

My mother moved out of state (about 18-25h drive) around four years ago. Every time I visited was a disaster, but that's a whole different story. She was living with J the entire time. J is possibly worse than my mom is. He never cares about anything he does, and he sleeps with anything that moves. He brought women over to my mother's place *while she was there.* She called my grandmother crying her eyes out, and then lots of things happened. My grandmother somehow convinced me that she needed help, she's a ""battered woman"" and needs support from her ""only daughter."" J had planned on *killing her* and actually told her about it! She called a few times after that and we had things figured out.

I work in a small family-owned business marked as essential during Coronavirus. I make, at most, $80 a week right now due to cut hours and not as many sales. I'm fine with this, but I sent my mother $85 of my money, $20 from my *coworker*, $50 from my girlfriend's mother.. it was insane how much I sent her. My grandmother overdrafted her account twice. In total, we sent her well over $1200 just to rent a u-haul out of state and some for the cost of gas, and a bit for food along the way too. During all this, she sent us more and more voicemails and texts telling us how J kept stealing her money, someone put a tracker on her phone, etc etc... Which, surprisingly, was all true. She's kind of known for her terrible luck/decisions..

Once she finally arrived in my state, she picked a fight with my grandmother. There was drama and she didn't even sleep at our home the first night of her being back in her hometown. She ended up coming to my home at around one in the morning and made me grab things from her u-haul for her. I basically unloaded all the essentials and put them where she wanted them. Note, she's 35, I'm 17 and weak as hell.

The *VERY NEXT DAY*, I wake up to a man's voice. I haven't had a guy in my home in years, (Lesbian+grandmother's divorced+only child+socially awkward=literally no guys in the house, ever) so of course I was really confused and my anxiety was spiking like crazy. Because of traumas she gave me, I can't actually handle being alone in a house/room with a guy who's older than me. The familiar feeling of an anxiety attack started showing, and I went through the house trying to figure out what the hell was happening. 

Long story short (for that day at least) my mom thought it was a good idea to get drunk on her second day staying with her generous family and bring an equally as drunk man over, one who we haven't even met before.. Only good part was that the guy was pretty funny. He was going on about how his net worth is over $3mil and whatever, and that he wasn't drunk when he couldn't even stand upright.. grandma and I were kind of laughing watching him.

I went to the room my mother was staying in and asked her, ""So uh, who the hell is that and why are you both drunk?"" Yes, I know, I could've been nicer about it, but all considered I think I had the right to be a little pissy.. She went in on me and started screaming in my face, hers so close to mine I could practically taste the alcohol from her saliva she was spitting at me. It was terrifying but I stayed quiet until she was done telling me how much of a bitch I was. I told her, ""If you feel like you're not welcome here, you're free to leave.""

She called me. The person who helped her the absolute most... a terrible daughter. She had the nerve to tell me I didn't help her, and the only one who helped her with anything was this mystery drunk we've never met in our lives. I felt tears stinging my eyes, this was just.... a lot. It's a bit fuzzy here even though it's only been a month.. but she spilled water by my feet as I was running to my grandmother, and I slipped and bruised my side badly, and that gave her the chance to get to her first and tell HER side of things.

My grandmother's been kind of ignored during this. She supports me and I love her, but she always sides with my mom. Always. She always lets her back into the house, no matter how badly she screws things up. This time... was different. She promised me she believed me, and everything seemed great..

But today, my mom waltzed in like she owned the place and said ""I'm staying about thirty days or so."" My grandma seemed to be okay with it, and it leads me to believe they had this secretly arranged beforehand without me knowing. I feel powerless. Absolutely helpless. I can't move out yet, I barely make enough to cover bills right now (and I only cover about 1/3 of them, my grandma pays the rest). I have pets here that they have no idea how to take care of and I don't feel they're safe in their care. *I* don't feel safe here. I'm terrified every day, and now that she's physically here, in the room *right next to mine*, I feel like I can't even sleep. I'm physically sick right now. I can barely think. My girlfriend's here with me and it's helping a lot, but I don't want to keep her in this environment either. I don't know what to do.

My therapist is awesome. She gives good advice, but I can only talk with her once a week. She can't do much either, just give emotional support/advice on how to deal with *me.* The situation itself? Pff. I'm on my own..

Thank you anyone who decides to read through all this, it's a mess and I apologize for that.. I just feel alone and stuck in this situation. I gave a bunch of past history that doesn't relate to the issue right now just so readers could get an idea of where I'm coming from/why this is so upsetting to me..

601,124,231,I [17f] feel like quarentining with my family is making me into a horrible person,4.0,gqbt4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gqbt4m/i_17f_feel_like_quarentining_with_my_family_is/,8.0,1590445464.0,"My family was not great before, but the quarentine has made being at home so much worse.


Firstly, my dad treats my mom like shit. That's kind of an understatement actually. He treats everyone like shit. My dad claims that my mom doesn't have a ""real job."" She works really hard as a manager and deals with a lot of the crazy things that the people at her work do. Every time she wants to treat herself, she gets snide comments that ""she's spending his money."" My dad also borderline verbally abuses my mom on a day to day basis. Once she dropped and shattered nail polish on the floor and called for my dad for help. My dad screamed at her for 30 minutes straight, calling her a stupid bitch and claiming that she did it on purpose. He has such a short fuse, and if my mom says the slightest thing to upset him, he'll throw a tantrum and yell at her and retreat to his office. 

These are not the worst things that have happened with my dad's temper. Once my mom's laptop was being slow and not working so he decided to throw it across the living room. Another time my husky was bad during one of his tantrums and he beat on her. I wasn't home when that happened, but my mom tried to get him to stop but he wouldn't. 

My mom deals with a lot of this and really doesn't deserve it. She has a lot of stress on her plate with work and keeping the house managed. But she takes out a lot of her stress on me.

Yesterday, my dad told my mom I blatantly ignored him when he asked me to move my car. The thing was, he literally didn't ask. He was being petty and shit-talking me to my cat, and I didn't feel like dealing with him so I went upstairs and got a shower. My mom then said I should apologize to my dad, and I exploded. I said that I'm sick of walking on eggshells around him. He can be in a great mood and joking one minute and pissed off and yelling the next. I'm tired of dealing with him as he is a horrible person and treats everyone like garbage. My mom insisted that I continue to deal with it because she didn't want to cause any problems. I left the house soon after because I didn't want to be trapped in the house with him.

Today, I made a joke that my cat didn't give a f*** because he walked across the wet floor. My mom yelled at me, said that I shouldn't cuss, cussing makes me a bad person, etc. I was like ""okay, everyone else in this house cusses to the extreme"" (my mom said f***ing shit in front of my grandma, dad, and my bf and I the day before). I went to my room because I didn't want to argue (my dad was in the other room and likes to butt into arguments and start screaming). My mom came into my room and said it's disrespectful to leave, I'm not an adult, I'm acting like I can do anything, etc etc. She goes back downstairs and not 2 minutes later my dad is calling my older brother a lazy ass and my mom a dumb bitch. 

All of this combined has been really frustrating. My mom always apologies after taking stuff out on me, but I hate the way I'm living right now. I stay out of the way of my dad in general and am sick of being screamed at or hearing yelling all the time. Sometimes I catch myself being short tempered with my bf and friends unintentionally. I hate the person who I'm becoming and I don't want to be anything like my dad. I plan to be financially independent in college and live with my bf. I want to keep in touch with my mom and older brother but I never wanna see my dad again if I don't have to.

How can I work on being less angry and upset in general? I want to be able to be more friendly but nowadays I have such a short fuse. Is there a way that I can work on planning no contact with my dad after I go to college? Any advice would be appreciated.",2020.0,5.0,26.0,04:09:24,victim,30
602,125,233,I learned that my [26M] girlfriend [24F] of five years has been cheating on me with my best friend [27M] for the past two months. I'm lost as to what to do.,211.0,gap21w,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gap21w/i_learned_that_my_26m_girlfriend_24f_of_five/,190.0,1588250173.0,"Tl;dr at bottom of post; names changed for sake of story.

I’m just not sure to what to do from here. I’m still fairly shaken but I’m mostly just numb right now from learning about all of this. I would really appreciate any help or advice you can provide. Apologies for the incoming wall of text.

My girlfriend and I have been together for almost five years, and we were so many of each other’s firsts. We were each other’s first real sex partners, first real long-term relationship, first time moving in together with a significant other. We’ve had our ups and downs, but we both felt really happy and confident in our relationship. We’re both very loving and affectionate people by nature, and to find that in another person meant a lot to both of us. She has proven on so many occasions to be a thoughtful and caring partner for me even when I may not have necessarily deserved it. I don’t think I would have grown and accomplished as much as I have if it weren’t for the love, affection, and support that she has afforded me. On many occasions she said she wants to be with only me, always, and I truly could have seen myself spending a lifetime with her.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was up until about two years ago. We had both been drinking heavily one night and I started putting on moves toward her, which in turn led to us having intoxicated sex (I know I should have definitely had more self-control in retrospect, it was a complete error in judgment on my part). I didn’t think much of it during the moment (again since both of us were quite drunk), but the next morning she expressed that she didn’t really enjoy the sex and felt that I took advantage of her. The gravity of her side of the story from the previous night definitely resonated with me, and I can totally see how this was a morally grey area as far as consent goes. (Since I never got any explicit signs from her that she wasn’t into having sex. I understand of course that is no excuse, and I regret not seeking more explicit consent during our drunken states.) I immediately felt a deep pit of guilt in my stomach and promptly apologized to her, telling her that I totally understand if she wants to break off this relationship and never see me again. Basically that I understood what the fallout from my actions may be, and that I deserved any and all consequences arising from such. I truly regret ever hurting her in such a way, especially due to my own lack of awareness and my negligence towards her wellbeing. If I ever had the chance to take back what I did, I would do so in a heartbeat. 

It was a long and difficult conversation that morning, but she insisted on staying together with me and working to forgive me for what I did. She said that she felt that I did not intentionally seek to hurt her, and that she understood that the incident arose from negligence on my part and a lack of communication. I committed to working to undo the damage and strain I put on the relationship, and sought to regularly check in on her in regards to how she felt about the trauma and as to what I can do to help. To this day, I feel truly blessed that she found it in her heart to forgive me, and I know it was more than what I deserved. It took a long time, but by this point last year I had felt we had reached the level of comfort and trust that we had had prior to me hurting her. I have also since refrained from ever approaching that level of drunkenness since then. In retrospect I regret not pushing her/us to get therapy or counseling, but since we were students at the time we didn’t have the time or money to really pursue it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enter Michael, who my girlfriend knew as my longtime buddy from school. He was somebody that I bonded with over our frustrations with our shared program, and held similar tastes in music and video games. A little awkward and inexperienced when it came to sex (not that I was ever much better than he was), but had definitely messed around a bit with girls before I met him.  I always felt that perhaps he was a bit picky when it came to his taste in women, and I know that my girlfriend was not particularly his type, so I never had any reason to feel like I couldn’t trust him and my girlfriend to be alone together. 

About eight months ago, the three of us started having semi-regular movie nights/sleepovers. Perhaps I shouldn’t have entertained the idea of these get-togethers, but we had good times and it was honestly quite wholesome. I mean, what’s wrong with my girlfriend getting along with my friends right? I didn’t see anything wrong with our hangouts at the time, but I guess hindsight is 50/50. Eventually they started getting closer together, and apparently talked to each other (without me knowing) about their respective traumas (apparently he had endured severe childhood sexual abuse, which he had never told me about in all our years of knowing each other).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Around Christmas, my girlfriend and I had a big blowout fight (which was one of the very few that we have had in our entire relationship). She had wanted me to pick up a couple presents for her family, despite knowing that I had already spent a fair amount on her present (which was already tough to do being on a student budget and having just come off of exams). The whole conversation devolved into both of us feeling unappreciated by the other, with me upset because I felt she was using me for money and that she was not being very loving as of late, and her upset because she felt that I had been mean and distant toward her while I was studying (I definitely could have been a bit kinder towards her) and that I wanted her just for sex (which has never been true). As a result of the argument, she made me promise to be kinder and more thoughtful towards her over the next few months. Right around this time, my lease on my student house ended, so she invited me to move in with her into her mom’s basement (who gave me her blessing to do so), just while we both finish our last semester of school.

Moving in goes smoothly and we settle into a routine of studying, chores, and hanging out (when we do get the chance). We still have our sleepovers with Michael every so often, and all is fine and dandy. I tend to go to sleep fairly early, so I would often be the first to pass out. I knew however that my girlfriend tends to go to sleep early too, so I presumed that she and Michael would fall asleep not long after me. Over this time, I make extra effort to show my appreciation for her, getting several books for her and taking her out to a nice restaurant for Valentine’s Day. She takes notice of this, and expresses her appreciation for said efforts towards the end of March, just as the coronavirus started to really affect our city and force people to remain indoors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

About three weeks ago, I was doing some cleaning around our space while my girlfriend was upstairs watching TV with her family. She had left her phone on the bed, and just as I passed by it, I felt an urge to pick it up and go through her messages. We have always had an open phone policy with each other, as we trusted each other deeply and (at least I believed) that we had nothing to hide from each other. I had never opened her phone before without her being present and giving me her express permission before, but I felt I had to follow my gut instinct. As I started scrolling through the messages between Michael and her, what I found shocked me, and part of me still wishes now that I hadn’t done so.

Little did I know that between finishing my exams and doing my Christmas shopping, that she and Michael had met up, kissed, and fooled around a bit. Over the next month or so, they would continue to send more and more sexually explicit messages to each other, culminating in her expressing her desire to take his virginity. Reading more messages, I learned that they managed to do so at a sleepover we had not long before Valentine’s day, waiting until I had fallen asleep before having sex on the floor beside the bed. (I guess they must have been super sneaky, I don’t understand how they did so without me waking up or noticing them. I feel like such an idiot.) They apparently repeated this process several times during the sleepovers we had over the next month, before she sent him a message sometime towards the middle of March chewing him out for having grown distant and cold to her, and accusing him of using her for sex (oh the irony). He agreed that that his feelings for her weren’t as strong as they used to be and that their relationship should come to an end. They messaged each other a handful more times afterwards, but on a much more platonic level.

I took a couple screenshots of this last exchange and sent them to myself to have some evidence in case it became relevant. I reached out to my friend Will with the information I learned, and he immediately invited me to stay with him for the time being to remove myself from the situation. Before leaving, I confronted my girlfriend with the information I learned. I told her how disgusted I was to learn about how she slept with Michael behind my back so many times, how she shared nudes with him, how she told him she loved him, how good it felt to have him inside her according to her. She immediately expressed her remorse and regret for doing so and for hiding her actions from me, explaining that she and Michael had bonded over their sexual traumas and had started seeing him because she felt that somebody could finally relate to the pain she had experienced. 

While I could somewhat understand her logic and how her unresolved pain could have caused her to seek refuge in Michael’s company, I pressed her further on why hadn’t been forthcoming about her relations with him. She said by telling me, she felt that it would be forcing me to absolve her of her guilt and that she didn’t want to place the burden of that knowledge on me in exchange for clearing her conscience. She went to great lengths to emphasize that it was a severely misguided and sick attempt to heal from her trauma, and that she would have never cheated on me if I hadn’t assaulted her while drunk. She also promised that moving forward she would seek professional therapy and counseling for her trauma, and that she would spend the rest of her life making it up to me in repentance for her actions. She pointed out that since she forgave me for assaulting her while drunk and that she knows I would never hurt her that way again, that I should forgive her in turn for cheating on me and that  I can trust her not to do so again. I don’t claim to know what it is like to be raped or sexually assaulted, so maybe I should be lenient towards her in this case. However, I feel like the argument of “I slept with your best friend because it was an unhealthy reaction towards how you hurt me” is still pretty suspect logic for cheating on one’s partner, given the circumstances.

After some more back and forth arguing, we both came to realize we weren’t making any more progress, so I packed up my clothes and the study materials I would need for my upcoming exams and left for Will’s. When I arrived, I sat down with Will and his girlfriend to explain in further detail what I learned and how the conversation we had before leaving went down. While they both understood my hesitation to end the relationship and my desire to reciprocate the forgiveness she had shown me, they both strongly recommended that I leave her and encouraged me to demonstrate some backbone in this situation (I have never been a very confrontational person), stating their shared belief that once a cheater, always a cheater). I stayed with them for the week until I had finished my first (and toughest) exam, and have since moved back in with my parents for the meantime while I start job hunting and evaluating my options with this relationship. I’m truly grateful to Will and to my parents for giving me the space necessary while I wrestle with my decisions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

She and I have kept in touch since then, with her expressing how much she misses me and wants to make amends (she has been sending me very loving and apologetic messages and nudes), while I try to keep her at arm’s length and express my sadness and frustration with the whole situation. I have visited her a couple times to get items I need and to talk about the fate of the relationship. Even still, I feel such love and sexual attraction towards her in spite of the awful nature of her actions. I know it comes from a place of internal confusion and denial towards the situation, but it definitely makes me feel pathetic, and is part of why I have been dragging my feet about making the choice getting back together or permanently breaking things off with her. My trust in her has been violently shaken, but I still see nothing but the positive qualities in her, and I can’t tell if it’s because of my genuine feelings toward her or because of nostalgia for the relationship we used to have.

Everybody I have talked to has advised to me break up with her. I just don’t know what the limits of forgiveness are? She trusts me not to repeat my mistake which indirectly caused this whole mess, and I truly feel like she would never cheat on me again after this. But she and Michael had no problem hiding their affair from me and pretending that it never happened until the truth came out. I guess I’m glad I learned about it before we had gotten married or had kids, as small a comfort as that is. I keep thinking about what I could have done differently to avoid this from happening, as silly as it is. I go to sleep at night wishing that all of this was just a bad dream, and that everything would be back to normal upon waking up.  Even if her justifications for cheating on me had merit, two wrongs don’t make a right, no?

I’m so sick of being numb all the time. I feel occasional flashes of anger, grief, sadness, or disgust towards the situation, but nothing registers higher than lukewarm in terms of intensity. It was horrible to lose what were basically two of my best friends in the world at the same time. I feel like I’m stuck in an impossible situation: leaving means I lose my relationship with the best partner I’ve ever had (cheating aside), while staying means I compromise on my morals and self-respect. Leaving would be doing right by me and the support system that has helped me through this turmoil, while staying would reciprocate the forgiveness and love that she has shown me throughout the years, and also avoid the stress of formally breaking up with her and having to move out all of my stuff from her place. I don’t expect to her damage any of my stuff or to try and guilt trip me into forgiving and staying with her, but then again I never expected her to cheat on me in the first place.

My husband always finds a way to blame me for his incredibly vile behavior. II’ve lied and kept things from friends and family. I am in therapy and am nowhere near honest... to protect my husband..I guess.... but something finally clicked in my head. I’m finally regaining my power. I have contacted an attorney. I have paid in full (with my family’s help, so he doesn’t notice missing money). I have told him many times in the past I am done and want a divorce but he never “accepts” it. He will be served soon - BUT I am still living in our home (separate room) how do I make him understand! How do I go about this safely? I don’t feel like I can last any longer with this charade of “nothing is wrong”. We have children and he has an anger problem. 

I don’t want to make this more messy than it will probably be - so I don’t necessarily want to disappear in the night with our kids...

604,127,236,Found out my mom is cheating with a younger man,83.0,gwqr1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gwqr1u/found_out_my_mom_is_cheating_with_a_younger_man/,20.0,1591335145.0,"My sister and I found out my mom was cheating on my dad in December 2018. My sister saw a text message to my mom saying “I love you” and the sender was named with EB. My dad doesn’t text since he doesn’t know how to; therefore, we concluded it was someone else. I previously had my own suspicions of my mom because she started acting very paranoid of me being around her phone. She would also claim that her female boss wanted to hang out with her even though that boss lived an hour away and wanted to hang out at a Denny’s 10 minutes from our house.

To give you context to our family, we are Asian-American, so we follow the idea of having all children live at home until they get married. Otherwise, we are not allowed to move out. It may seem weird that my 25M brother, 30F sister, and I(20F) all live at home but that is our norm. My parents  emotionally abuse us. A prime example would be making us guilty for hanging with friends and shaming us for not being at their beck and call. It sounds weird but my siblings and I raised each other up. My parents were never there for us growing up due to jobs, so now that we are grown up they expect us to take care of them. If we live our lives, we’re selfish.

To get back to the cheating topic, my siblings confronted her about the text message and she yelled at us for accusing her. We started the conversation with if she was having an affair, she should do the right thing and divorce. She denied there was another man. We responded that if that were true then she should show us her phone and explain those messages. She lashed out on us and said that we weren’t her mother and she was our mother. Before you think it’s a breach of privacy, she used to let us use her phone all the time since I bought her an iPhone for her birthday (she used to use those old flip phones) and she never really cared about her privacy or ours. What was hers was ours and vice-versa. We grew up with our parents constantly invading our privacy and that was just normal.

My sister stood her ground that my mom was cheating, so my mom directed the yelling towards me. I’m weak-hearted so I instantly started crying. Since I cried, my sister faltered in her position and my mom took that chance. She patted us on the back and said “Well, at least now it’s cleared in the air. It would be bad if you never told me and thought your whole life that I cheated on your father. It’s okay, I forgive you three.”

EDIT: To further explain, she told us ""It would be bad if you didn't tell me and you told your father.""

A few months passed and even though we accused my mom, she still continued going outside to hang out with her “female boss”. If I asked to use her phone for something, she would watch my every move when using it. More months passed and my mom suddenly asked us to buy her a new phone even though her phone was working just fine. My dad pressured us to buy it for her anyways, so we did. Once she got the phone, we helped her transfer her data and she carelessly let us keep the old phone. She doesn’t really know how technology works. Since we set up the cloud on the iPhone, it connected with both phones. The old phone's messages were wiped but the cloud updated messages from the new phone.

We saw the text messages and the context of it all. They call each other with pet names and he frequently asks her for risqué pictures, which she sends. I guess we should’ve known from the beginning but it was so easy to just believe that she wasn’t cheating. All three of us want to move out together, but I’m concerned for my dad. He is 65 and I’m worried about his health with us gone. Should we tell our dad or let him live the rest of his life in peace? They are in severe debt and my mother is the only one working since he retired. He lives his whole life around my mom and loves her the most. I think it would break his heart if he learned about this.

TLDR; My mom is a cheater and I don’t know if we should tell our dad or not. We want to move out since it’s been detrimental to our mental health but I’m worried about his health since he is already 65. What should we do?

I had a huge crush on him during high school but we never dated in high school because he wasn't comfortable with the age difference; After high school we got together and I truly was the happiest girl ever. I had dreamed of him for years and now he was finally mine! I thought it was like the best love story ever.

He comes from a wealthy family and is paying for my schooling, housing and everything else I need. I've always wanted to be an doctor but never thought I could because of lack of funds until his mother offered to pay for my school (I later found out that he had told his mom to offer it. When I found out I thought it was the sweetest thing but now I realise it was probably to gain control over me.) His mother has always been like a second mom to me even before we were together and I love her to death. She's a small reason I don't want to leave him. Leaving him would probably mean leaving her.

Anyways, even though he's wealthy he didn't have the best upbringing. His dad was abusive and although he hardly talks about it, I know that his dad once threw feces and urine at him as well as making him eat his own vomit.

Sorry for the rambling I just wanted to provide some background I guess. Basically, my boyfriend is abusive sometimes. He loves putting me down, hurting my feelings, and humiliating me in public. I honestly think he gets a thrill out of it. Along with punching me, shoving me and grabbing and raping me. He's 6'3 and 210lbs and I'm 5'4 110lbs He blames it on his upbringing and promises to change but doesn't.  He realizes the hitting is wrong but not the namecalling. He thinks they're jokes that I'm taking too seriously.

We had unprotected sex on new years because I didn't want to make him mad by asking him to wear a condom and I haven't had a period since. I'm very irregular so I didn't take a pregnancy test until now and it came back positive. He knows I took a test but doesn't know the results yet.

im so lost as to what to do. We've been living together because of youknowwhat and the abuse has been getting worse and worse.  I know that abuse increases during pregnancy so I'm avoiding telling him.

I don't have any money or anything so I have no way to leave. I've completely cut off my family except my 16 year old brother and 14 year old sister because of him convincing me that they weren't good for me

I dont want him to kill our baby. I want our baby to have a good life and be safe and I also want them to have a father. I don't give a fuck if he kills me.

I don't know the purpose of this post but I have nobody else. My life has completely gone to shit because of him. No friends other than his friends and they're not going to help me.

She's also a freelance in my field, but far more experienced. We started a great friendship since then, she's a party-hard extrovert, funny and great. 

I met my now husband three years ago and we're crazy in love, he's an incredible guy and always takes care of me. He moved in from his country a year before our wedding and we got married on September 2019. We have so much fun together and my family absolutely loves him. 

When I first introduced each other, N was in a very tough relationship. I don't think her girlfriend at the time was good for her and I was very honest about it. It ended pretty bad because of the constant fighting (we had to go and literally rescue her from the ex several times) and we both tried to be there for her. My husband was really only doing it because of me, he said N was a little too much for him and tended to overwhelm him.

With the wedding prep and the honeymoon, last year was pretty busy and I had to skip a couple parties and events N hosted. She introduced us her new girlfriend at my wedding, were she apparently had a great time and whatnot.

On December, her girlfriend snapped at me saying that she couldn't believe how bad we were treating N. I was shocked so I decided to talk to N about it and she said she was mad because I didn't come to her parties, I wasn't spending that much time with her anymore and that my husband's jokes were rude. I apologized for all of the things I was doing wrong but when asking about my husband's attitude to her she said that he was just rude in his responses and didn't like the jokes he made. She highlighted that he only did those jokes when she was with her girlfriend and, therefore, they felt attacked, she thought it was related to her sexuality. I asked if he said something explicitly rude or called them names and she said it was the humor he had. 

Now, my husband loves to make jokes. He loves to tease people and everyone has a good laugh when he's around. He never crosses some lines, though. I told him about it and he promised not to do any jokes when N was around.

It seemed like all was good, but yesterday a friend sent me the number for a women's organization that ""could help me"". Apparently, N was spreading the rumour *among our work colleagues* that my husband was homophobic and verbally abusive.

607,130,239,My boyfriend gave me until tomorrow morning to pack my bag and move in with him.,3.0,gt3xwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gt3xwl/my_boyfriend_gave_me_until_tomorrow_morning_to/,7.0,1590824593.0,"Yesterday was a crazy day. My daughter’s graduation from kindergarten was in the morning, and my nephew’s was in the evening. I can’t drive due to seizures and my license being medically suspended, so I had my parents drive me there to the parade for my daughter. My boyfriend and his daughter were also there. The girls are only one month apart in age. They’re very close. 

My dad hates the idea that I’m a mother figure to my SD. He says that I can’t love my own child if I love someone else’s. Which is objectively not true. My dad doesn’t like my boyfriend, which is his right. But yesterday while my boyfriend and I were talking and decorating the truck for my daughter, my dad jumped out of the truck and started yelling and cursing at my boyfriend because he “didn’t like the way that his face looked when he talked to me.” We were all wearing masks so idk where he gathered these so called “facial expressions” that my boyfriend was making. My dad pushed my boyfriend off of the truck (it was parked) and he tried to literally fight my boyfriend. 

At first my boyfriend tried to reason with my dad and asked him not to do all of that because he’s not ever been disrespectful to my parents (true) and he feels as my dad was being disrespectful to the kids by doing all of that cursing. Which I agree. My dad told my boyfriend “fuck you and your kid,” then called him some choice names, including the n-word (my family and I are black and so is my boyfriend and his family, but it still wasn’t okay). Of course when my dad told my bf “fuck your child” then my boyfriend wanted to fight. So yeah I was in the parking lot of my daughter’s private school trying to break up a fight between my dad and my boyfriend. My dad is, without a doubt in my mind, totally in the wrong for yesterday. It was humiliating and infuriating and then I was blamed for inviting my boyfriend and stepdaughter to my daughter’s graduation. They wanted to be there. My dad is the one who jumped out of the car looking for a fight over “facial expressions.”

So today my boyfriend basically told me that now is the best time to take that leap of faith and to pack my things and my daughter’s things and move in with him starting tomorrow morning. He said that yesterday was the final straw for my dad and he can’t deal with the harassment anymore and that my dad crosses one line too many when he said “fuck your child.” And as badly as I hate living here (I’m disabled and moved back in with my parents after my divorce and car accident last year and my mother is my representative payee for my disability check and she tightly controls my money and never allows me to get much of it) I am terrified to move in with my boyfriend when we’ve had so many arguments and issues and tears lately. He’s right in that my parents are abusive and my daughter and I need to get out of this house, but am I jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire?",2020.0,5.0,30.0,13:28:13,victim,
608,131,240,I (34M) was banned from my sister’s (32F) wedding by her fiancé (35M). Now she wants my help getting our family to go.,2.0,gdyx2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gdyx2e/i_34m_was_banned_from_my_sisters_32f_wedding_by/,28.0,1588718362.0,"The second time I met him, my sister’s fiancé had a breakdown.  He told me he didn’t like my family and he’d already spoken to my sister about wanting boundaries from us. No matter what we 've tried to make him comfortable, he kept publicly lashing out and demanding distance with more and more of a focus on me. After the third time I met him, my sister wrote she had to distance me or else lose her relationship. Then she announced she wasn’t even allowed to talk to him about me for four months.  She finally gave him an ultimatum she wouldn’t live with him if he didn’t see me, so he insisted on a “fresh start” – we all had to pretend nothing happened. He gave me a big hug when he saw me and I felt sick but I went along with it. I was told it went fine, but then he was refusing to see me again. I told my sister I’d wait until he’s ready and she said then he’ll never see you so she asked me to keep trying. This cycle went on and on. 

I guess I’m an intimidating older brother figure but I’ve never seen anyone behave like this. His complaints, I was told, were I made a joke about the plaid shirt he was wearing on our first meeting, my sister had just had cancer surgery the second time I saw him and I asked why his work schedule changed so he couldn’t be there with her as planned, on our third meeting he didn’t like when I reassured him we made a train on time and then was upset I apologized twice when he still seemed upset. My sister also told him I asked her why she was carrying bags up four flights of stairs to his apartment when the doctor told her not to carry things after her surgery so he didn’t like that (I never said it to him, I just asked it supportively to her and said he probably didn't realize). He also blamed me for her attempts to talk to him to work things out even though I barely ever interacted with him.  At one point my sister said I was the only problem in their life and I said ""that’s probably cause you do whatever he says"" and she replied, “that’s my problem, I’m working on that myself.” That was almost 2 years ago – they’ve been together close to 2.5 and she does seem to do whatever he asks.

On Thanksgiving I tried to do whatever I could to make him happy.  After what everyone thought was a nice family dinner, he approached me and told me I’m “heavy” – he said my sister and his mother keep things “light and easy” for him and he didn’t want the “sins of my family” in their lives. Behind my back he told my family I was “mentally ill” and that he would give me consequences for it while he demanded distance again.  I was told not to go to their wedding (9 months away) – and my sister didn’t speak to me for 4 months despite my many efforts to connect over e-mail. I was deeply offended because I actually do have a mental illness and I do some public anti-stigma work.  I was hoping for an apology for that comment, at least from my sister. 

After months them telling people I was excluded from their wedding, I wrote letting him know I might be including the story of being estranged from my sister in my anti-stigma talks since personal experience is a part of them – and I stressed repeatedly that my message in the talks and my message to him is that I’m always open to resolution and moving forward.  But if I was losing my sister, I wanted to channel this awful experience into helping others by sharing a message of hope for reconciliation after mental illness stigma, instead of pretending nothing ever happened. Since then my sister and her fiancé have told others that this message is the reason I’m not welcome at the wedding even though I only wrote it after over a month of already being banned from the wedding, and 2 years of other serious public on-and-off estrangements from them. I also never actually did those talks.

After a few months of them planning to exclude me from the wedding, our father and stepmother formally refused to go to (and pay for) it unless her fiancé allowed me to be there.  But my sister says he can never change because of his severe anxiety.  He refuses to even talk to anyone to explain himself, even the people paying for his wedding.  My sister and her fiancé still want them to be there, and my sister keeps trying to convince them to go.  

I’ve tried to still be supportive – I spoke to an abusive relationship expert who said my sister needs us to keep being there for her even when we're hurt so we’re still there for her when things get worse in the relationship (as opposed to letting him isolate her as he seems to want to do).  But they both keep expecting us to revolve so much around them.  When my sister finally called me, she asked me to help convince my family to enthusiastically attend the wedding without me there. She lamented our entire family didn’t like her fiancé - I reassured her I think he’s sick, not malicious. I said he’s not managing his feelings well and people think he’s a jerk because he treats people as disposable instead of facing his fear.  I tried to encourage her to address his anxiety but she’s too scared to upset him and the way she talks it sounds like she may not be allowed to discuss this with him (like she's said in the past with other estrangements).

This situation is hurting everyone in our family, and several people are telling her so.  I’m not sure what to do to help her have a good wedding without me, or even if I should?  Everyone sees the problems here but we don’t want to lose my sister.  The experts say she needs to decide on her own to stand up for herself in this relationship – we can’t force her.  Any ideas of whether I should help her and how to do it?

TL;DR – Sister’s severely anxious fiancé demands I not be at wedding. It's upset my family and some people won't go. Now she asked me to help my family be okay with it - how can I?",2020.0,5.0,6.0,04:24:22,victim,

ThrowRA. Me (23f) and my boyfriend(24m) got engaged a few months ago and I can’t get over how disappointing it was. Apologies for spelling and grammar mistakes I’m on my phone. 

I’m going to try and keep this as short as possible. It was our second anniversary, we went out and celebrated the day by going to an arcade and getting food, nothing fancy but perfect for us. We got home and I was doing the dishes, he called me to our bedroom and I repeatedly  told him to hang on because I was almost done but he wouldn’t stop so I was annoyed but I went. I walk in and turn on the lights, he’s down on one knee which was super cute but he just wrapped his arms around my waste and hugged me. He apologized for the “shitty plastic box” as he put it, that the ring came in and that he’s sorry if it wasn’t the right ring. We had discussed getting engaged and I mentioned a few times I didn’t want him to waste money on a really expensive ring as we’re trying to save up to move and buy a house. I ended up finding some cute cheap ones on Etsy and Thats what he went with. The lack of confidence made it horribly unromantic, he did eventually say “will you be my wife” so I obviously said yes. But then he started apologizing for not doing anything fancy and I really didn’t want a big fancy proposal, I was fine with being at home but he was basically shitting on his own proposal as it was happening so that bothered me. 

Cue to telling people we’re engaged. I group texted my family (I live about 1300km from them so I couldn’t wait till I actually got to see them), they were thrilled for us and wished us the best. 

Now it was his turn to tell his family. His family is great, they’re crazy and drama filled people but for the most part not bad. His mother however is the bane of my existence. She is a rude and nasty and treats her son like garbage, all he ever wants is her approval so he never defends himself or just makes excuses for her behaviour. I learnt early on that wasn’t a worth while argument I just made it clear I don’t like her because of how she treats him and no one should have to put up with the mental abuse she puts out. She’s one of those people that are just so miserable and unhappy in their own life that they need to make everyone around them just as miserable. When we first started dating she called us a joke and told him to stop wasting his time because “once she gets to know the real you she’s going to leave you and move back home”. She would also tell him he doesn’t care about his family anymore because he was staying at my house instead of staying at his. He didn’t even live with her, he lived with his grandma who pretty much raised him! Basically just said anything to make him feel bad for finding someone and trying to make a life of his own. 

So he followed my route and texted her to tell her, he sent a picture and said “I guess  ere engaged now!”. Her only response was “fools”. Not what you want but whatever he moved on and went to call his grandma to tell her. His mom does not live there but she spends all her time there so she answered the phone, she wouldn’t let him talk to his grandma so he got annoying and bitched at her and she goes “well what do you want me to say” so all he said was “a congratulations would of been nice” hung up the phone and instantly started crying. I felt awful, my heart broke seeing how hurt he was. I consoled him but it really put a damper on the rest of the night. It took all the spark out of the air, he knows I don’t like his mom so it was hard to stay calm when I was so angry that she could just so easily hurt him on purpose and have no remorse about ruining what was literally our first big milestone together. She very much ruined the rest of the day, there was awkward tension and sadness looming around so I ended up just going to bed. 


It was nice going to work the next day and getting congrats from them, it made me happier. I work with my hands all day and on day #3 of being engaged the band on my ring bent (I guess that’s what you get when you buy a $40 engagement ring) so I stopped wearing it to work. I’d wear it elsewhere but 1 of the 4 prongs holding the diamond in place was longer than the rest and cut me twice so I just stopped wearing it all together. He reached out to the person on Etsy and got no reply so I don’t think a replacement is possible (I do genuinely like the ring so I didn’t want a different one). I’ve brought it up and he says he wants to get me another ring that’s better quality so I can wear it forever but he said maybe for Christmas, until then I have no ring. Im not super thrilled on the idea of my replacement engagement ring being my Christmas present this year but man I just want a ring to wear. It honestly makes me so sad not having anything to symbolize I’m engaged, it makes me forget that I am. It was a shitty day and then I got to wear a ring for what felt like 20 minutes and then it’s been nothing since. We didn’t even celebrate getting engaged or take any pictures that day. Thinking about it puts me in a miserable mood and honestly makes me wish he just didn’t ask sometimes. I wish I could get a redo. I know that sounds awful but it’s just not a nice memory to think about. It’s suppose to be a big happy day and turned out the opposite. 

I must sound very dramatic and like a whiny little girl but this really has been something that’s bothered me for months. He knows how much it hurt me with what his mom did and he says he won’t let her ruin anything else for us but I doubt that. I just need help. I don’t know how to get over this or make it better. Wedding season definitely doesn’t help, I cry every time I see someone on Facebook get engaged because all I think about is how they probably got this big happy day and a ring they can wear and I’m so jealous. I want to stop fixating and being sad about it but just haven’t been able to. How do I move on from this?",2020.0,6.0,6.0,09:09:25,victim,23
610,0,0,I [26M] am at odds over leaving my wife [27f] due to severe family abuse and drama.,122.0,fqx1v6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fqx1v6/i_26m_am_at_odds_over_leaving_my_wife_27f_due_to/,88.0,1585473750.0,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Not sure where else to go, or even if there’s a way to go.

There’s a TL;DR at the bottom so please feel free to skip.

I [26M] have been married to my wife [27F] for 2 years. We just had our 2nd anniversary. We’ve been together for 8 years total now.

Since day 1, there’s been an issue between myself and her family. Specifically, two people. Her mother [45f] and her grandmother [65f]. While there’s a lot of backstory, here’s the tidbits that matter.

My wife was raised essentially to serve the mother and grandmother. While growing up, she wasn’t “allowed” to date, or to go out with friends or do anything that kids or teenagers do. Her siblings did, but not her. She was to stay home and take care of the house and family. A real life Cinderella if that makes any sense.

Her mother and grandmother both hate me to pieces. When we first started dating, her grandmother had to “allow” her to date. She was 20, I was 19. Both adults. The crux of the issues comes from the idea that I’m “stealing” her. In my own opinion, they’re more upset that they’re losing a slave. But to this day, she’s responsible for all the cooking, cleaning and caretaking of the grandmother, who is not at all appreciative of what’s happening. Her mother moved a few hundred miles away and calls every once in a while to berate my wife for marrying me and for not living the life they’ve laid out for her. They call her horrible names, constantly mock her about her shortcomings and demean her in front of absolute strangers. When my mother in law first met my mother, my mother had to leave the room before she did something she was going to regret. My MIL decided to tell my mother how dumb, fat and useless my wife is essentially to a complete stranger. My mother loves my wife, my father does too and they were both incredibly saddened and in a rage when they heard what my MIL was saying. Her grandmother does the same thing on occasion. But she’s less making fun of her and just likes to find things to complain about and then make problems where none exist.

All of this is background for the main issue. My wife simply tries to appease them to ensure they stop harassing her. They don’t stop, their manipulative, evil people. They know what they’re doing. We don’t talk to each other, because I’ve said many *choice* words over the years to them both for how they treat her, but they know my wife will always come running back the moment they start to cry and beg for her to come back.

So. 2 years in to our marriage, I see my wife on the occasional weekend. We aren’t separated. She simply lives with her grandmother instead of me. If we’re lucky, her grandmother will “allow” my wife to come see me for the weekend. Sometimes not. This week in particular we were supposed to have a date night Yesterday. I was going to rent a fun movie, I got all the fixings for her to not be “allowed” back.

We’ve had several conversations and even more arguments over the issue. We want to have a family, hard to have one because it takes two to make a child. We want to buy a house, but every house has to have space for the grandmother and every consideration has to be made for her.

We want to travel, but can’t because that would mean spending more than a whole weekend away from the grandmother. If these requirements aren’t met, my wife can expect verbal lashings.

Like I said, many arguments, many discussions. I’m at the end of my rope. The only way for this to end is for the grandmother to die. Since the mother isn’t here. Part of me feels bad, I truly wished that she would get this Corona virus and just die, just leave us alone so we can finally live our lives. We’re getting to a point in our life where we simply won’t be able to have kids or travel or even just be together.

My wife is truly too good for me. She’s sweet, caring and loving. I try to spoil her so when she comes over, there’s nothing to cook or clean. I do all of that. I want her to just sit down, relax and play Animal Crossing. She’s truly a good, honest woman and she makes me happy.

By the time her grandmother finally croaks naturally, we’ll be in our 40’s. She’s still “healthy”. She moves around no problem. I simply cannot wait and give up a family because of her. I do feel bad for wishing her death, but she’s stealing our life.

I don’t know what to do, the wife is too afraid to do anything. Part of me is wants to just get on a plane and disappear somewhere they’ll never find us.

I don’t want to leave my wife. It’s simply cruel to leave her to her fate. She’ll spend her entire life, caring for these horrible woman, only for them to die and leave her with nothing. She has a lot of issues stemming from them. She’s riddled with anxiety and depression and other disorders and there’s just nothing I can do to help. Everything we’ve done from counseling to even therapy suggestions get mocked and she gets harassed for even considering them.

TL;DR MIL and Grandmother brainwashed wife in to being a servant, berate and harass her constantly and force her to stay home with the Grandmother. I only get to see my wife on the weekends if she’s “allowed”. Want to leave this drama behind but my wife is truly a great person whom I want to be with.",2020.0,3.0,29.0,15:07:30,victim,26

—


I’m struggling with an in-law issue that is complex, as they all tend to be. 

My husband has a small family, surviving it’s mainly his mom and brother left. His mother, my mother in law, generally dislikes me and is fundamentally terrified to ever disappoint her sons. 
Husband and I have had a number of issues over the years, stemming from his mental health struggles. A handful of years ago, I left him for six months as he got himself help. She repeatedly texted and emailed me some pretty terrible things. (“This is all your fault, what you’ve done to him.” At announcement of last baby, “you obviously forgot your birth control because he wouldn’t have wanted this.” “I don’t get to see my grandchildren because you are there.” Etc etc etc.)  I have never replied to her over the years. 

I have always hosted all holidays, and things are strained but cordial for the sake of the children (we have a few kids.) I tend to stay in the kitchen to cook, drink a ton of wine, and generally ignore in-laws until they leave. 
We are in our 40s, and have a decent life overall. 


——- start here for current issue ——-
Now. The issue. 

Husbands brother is a wealthy white collar professional who is, by all accounts, in his very first relationship in his mid-40s. (Wealthy as in millions of dollars, this becomes relevant.) Lets call him Chad. 

Chad is sweet, timid, and submissive. A good uncle. We see him at holidays. 

Two and a half years ago he began dating a woman his friends introduced him to. Shortly after they began dating (a few weeks?) she claimed to be assaulted by a friend of hers, and she spiraled into deep alcoholism to the point of being entirely unable to function. She checked into rehab, and Chad became responsible for her dog. He saw many red flags, duh, but didn’t feel he could break up with a woman who was in such a vulnerable position. It became a cycle. In & out of rehabs, with Chad overtime becoming more and more responsible for her wellbeing (full time caretaker of dog, her mail, talking to her doctors etc.) 
It came out eventually that she has been in DOZENS of rehabs for chronic alcoholism since she was 18 years old. (Now mid 30s.) Dozens. At one point she spent 9 months inpatient. Let’s call her Molly. 

Molly is stunningly beautiful, has a masters degree from a highly esteemed college, her parents are ambassadors who raised her all over the world, and she comes from a upper middle class lifestyle with no discernible family abuse. 
(No one ever knows, but I have spent a decent amount of time with her parents. They live on the other side of the world. They’re caring people, from what I can tell.) 

She’s charming, sweet, and has the helpless innocence that makes you want to protect her. She’s like a trembling Yorkshire terrier in human form. My mother in law ADORES her. (I’m a bit of the opposite. Opinionated, independent & firmly assertive of myself.) 

In one of her breaks from rehab, Molly becomes pregnant. Molly keeps drinking. This is 4-5 months into their relationship. Chad pleads with her to have an abortion. She refuses and keeps drinking, though is “trying to stop.” 
We see them maybe once during this pregnancy, as they keep mostly to themselves. 
Chad buys them a giant house in the suburbs. Molly wants to get married. 

Baby is measuring small throughout, and finally around the 6 month mark the baby is diagnosed as “severe intrauterine growth restricted” and is measuring in the 1-2 percentile. Baby evicted at 8 months, weighs 4lbs. Lots of doctors involved. 
I’m in the medical field, but kept my distance because : boundaries. 

We see the baby, a girl, at Easter. They live only 20 min away, but their lives have become a mystery to us overall. 
There are a number of family events over the next few months. Chad would arrive alone with this tiny frail baby, Molly was always MIA. I’ve never seen Molly hold or touch the baby. 

Four months later it’s our toddlers birthday party, full of my family & our neighbors. Chad brings the baby, Molly shows up an hour later completely utterly wasted. 
She hides inside our house, while the rest of us celebrate in the backyard. She drinks a bottle and half of our wine. Mother in law completely oblivious. Thinks she “isn’t feeling well.”

When it’s time to go, Chad stands in the doorway of her car, fighting with her not to drive. We are on our front porch eating cake, and their argument lasts an hour. He finally convinces her to go with him. We give them space/privacy, and pretend we don’t notice anything. 
In the middle of the night he takes a cab to our house and picks up her car. He’s efficient at cleaning up her messes. 


A month later Chad calls my husband to tell him Molly is three months pregnant. (So, was pregnant and wasted at the party.) 

I’m irate. But I bite my tongue and continue to “keep family peace.” 

Christmas comes, this baby is also small and has a two severe heart conditions that will require surgery at birth and three more surgeries before kindergarten. A boy. They also believe he may have a chromosomal defect, one linked to maternal alcohol abuse. (Heart defects also a symptom of maternal alcohol abuse in pregnancy.) 

Baby1 is showing severe delays, and cannot put on weight. Today, she’s a year old and wears newborn diapers. She’s 11lbs. 
Again, I’ve never seen Molly hold or care for Baby1. I held her through each of the last holidays. 

In January, at 32 weeks pregnant, Chad finds Molly unresponsive. He calls an ambulance. She has severe alcohol poisoning. Due to poisoning the baby so intensely, her body goes into spontaneous labor. Baby is born, he weighs just under 3lbs. 

Chad calls us and asks if we can take Baby1. I’m more than happy to. I go buy a crib for her, and she stays a week. I don’t want to give her up. Chad comes over a few times to see Baby1, in between sleeping at the hospital with Baby2 in the NICU. I’m firm, honest, and harsh with Chad. 
I make it clear this was his responsibility, and he has enabled a situation where he has two permanently brain damaged children. I tell him that he is not responsible for Molly, but only his children. Chad is responsive, and heartbroken. My husband is silent, he thinks Chad is to blame. Chad fills us in on more details, explains she’d been hospitalized for alcohol poisoning a month earlier. They were in Hawaii and she couldn’t walk in the airport due to being too drunk (at 5-6 months pregnant.) Again, I’m irate. 

Four days after baby2, let’s call him Nate, is born - Molly checks into rehab again due to ultimatum Chad has given her. She blows a .32 blood alcohol when admitted. 
Molly lasts four days in rehab. When baby1 is not at daycare, she’s with us. 

DCFS is involved. They say Molly cannot be alone with either child. Molly faces no charges for abuse or criminal neglect. (Rich, white, educated, pretty & submissive. Hits every marker for privilege.) 

Nate, baby2, needs a 9 hour open heart surgery. Surgery goes well. 

I’m emotionally struggling over this, and seek out a therapist and go to a few al-anon meetings for families of alcoholics. I cry a lot at therapy and meetings, and remain stoic at home. 

Later, it’s clear he’s succumbing the the stress on his poor tiny damaged and abused body. 

He hangs on for a month, but his organs are now all failing. He never breathed on his own, but has now lost liver and kidney function. He has zero chance of living. 
It’s time to take him off life support, and Chad asks me to come help. I go, bring photos of his cousins, treasures from his deceased grandfather, rocks & seashells from the country Molly & I are from. Molly and I are culturally catholic - she is practicing, I am very anti-church. 

COVID19 is just beginning and churches have shut down. I find a local catholic priest to come to baptize Nate and read him last rites, for Molly’s sake. 
I spend the day with Molly, Chad, my mother in law & a baby who is by all accounts already dead. 

After ordering lunch, and going out for a few errands alone (I assume to drink, though she never appears drunk and I don’t smell anything,) 
Molly decides she wants to keep praying for a miracle. She can’t do it. 

They want to go home. I ask to stay with Nate for a while. I sit and read him my favorite poems, I touch his gorgeous perfectly formed body - his thick black hair and long thin graceful ballerina feet. I tell him about his cousins, and i play Nina Simone & Bing Crosby & Ella Fitzgerald etc for him. He deserved some beauty. 

I talk to the attending cardiac neonatologist  and make it clear what the backstory is. She knows his birth story, but did not know about Baby1, or the previous history of hospitalizations for alcohol poisoning. She agrees the children need protection, and profusely thanks me. 

I say goodbye to Nate. I let him know how loved he is. 

30 full days later, Nate is brain dead with no organ function. The hospital ethics committee compels them, finally, to remove life support. All the while, mother in law is living with them to take care of baby1, Molly’s friends have made her a meal train (“to remove the burden of having to cook during this time”, again, they have millions of dollars, they raise a few thousand for ‘restaurant gift cards’), and Molly continues to post updates on social media asking for prayers and explaining she knows she will be able to take her “healthy son home safely to be with his family soon.” 

DCFS somehow disappears at some point and no further restrictions are placed on Molly. 
Mother in law has zero clue that Molly did this to both Baby1 & Nate. 

I text mother in law at one point and I say, “i am so glad you are there to help, I know that Chad & Baby1 need your support.” 
She replies, “and Molly does too.” 

Nate is removed from life support and passes quickly. 

Molly posts a series of long tributes on social media. The obituary is gaslighting absurd nonsense. 
She repeats that her sons light was too bright for this world, she doesn’t know why god needed to take her son but he must have a plan. So on and so forth with the bullshit. 

She continues to seek support as a heroic grieving mother who did everything to save her child who was senselessly taken from her. 

I know Molly is fundamentally powerless over alcohol, but Chad has the resources for the best care possible. At minimum, a sober buddy to follow her around during pregnancy. They are both directly responsible for the death and harm to these children. 




So. 
In conclusion. What the fuck do I do? 
Do I blow my husbands small family up by telling the truth? That Molly murdered her child and deeply abused her daughter so she’s permanently brain damaged? Do I bar her from my home during holidays? 
We would then lose baby1, and chad. My mother in law already hates me and thinks I’m a trouble maker, that’s not going to change. 

My husband wants peace at all costs and would not back me up.

At the time I was engaged to my best friend, and girlfriend of 10 years Abby. During the breakdown I basically fell apart completely, I stopped taking care of myself, became a recluse, suffered insomnia and fell prey to destabalizing anxiety/depression. Me and Abby had lived together for 3 years at that point, and I had been taking care of both of us through it all. I did 99% of the cooking, laundry, chores, and paid virtually everything. This took a toll on me, and during my breakdown Abby essentially declared her unhappiness and left. Something changed in me when this occurred and even though I loved her more than I can quantify/qualify I just couldnt even fight for it anymore. Maybe it was selfish, but I really needed her to fight for me.

For the following 8 months I was cooped up in the apartment I shared with Abby, alone, unemployed, depressed, and scared. I didnt see a single friend during this time, and sold virtually everything I owned except for the clothes on my back to stay in my apartment. I wasnt even living week to week, I was surviving day to day, rationing out what little I had to make it to the following day.

For the first time in my life I genuinely considered suicide during this time. I've been through a lot, but I never knew it could get so dark, I find it deeply uncomfortable to think about those times.

Then one day for the first time in about a year I heard from Sarah [25F]. We had known each other for about 5 years, and she had been in a mutually toxic/abusive relationship with a former friend of mine. Me and Abby had been there for Sarah during the aftermath of her breakup a few years prior, and once she learned what happened with me and Abby she worked to reestablish our friendship.

In the beginning she would check in on me, call me, text me, and stop by on weekends to keep me company. It was weird at first, I was so used to being alone, and on my own in every way. But Sarah was always there for me. She brought me medicine when I was sick, cooked me food when I was exhausted, engaged with me on topics I cared about, talked with me about my own future, encouraged me to do better for myself.

Eventually we became intimate, and a new romance was born. During this time is when things become more complicated, and where I know I am more at fault.

Sarah would continually drop hints, inquire, and ask me for more commitment. Every time we spoke about it I would reiterate that I'm just not ready for something serious, that it has nothing to do with her, and everything to do with me. That in some fucked up way, I still needed to be alone. 

I wasnt going out of my way to see Sarah, however in my weakness I allowed her to keep coming to see me, and to keep talking with her. Even though I continually expressed my lack of ability to handle a relationship she kept pushing me. I really had no one else.

Eventually I was able to find new work, but I was too late and my living situation capsized. I ended up moving back in with my Mom, and living on her couch. It's a complicated environment as we share a tiny apartment and there is no privacy whatsoever. But I've been doing my best to achieve redemption, and get my life together. 

To put it into perspective, one year ago I was searching for the courage to end my life and was a failure in everyway. Today, I own a car again, I held a full time job for 6 months, and am starting a new job in a week, which will officially be the highest pay rate I've ever had. I've been medicated for months without error. In general, I'm beginning to feel like there is hope for me on the horizon.

However, things have been twisting my mind with Sarah. After I moved in with my Mom, I explained to Sarah that I needed time to work on me, and needed to put myself first. However, somehow I just havent been able to do so. A lot of what brought us together in the first place is our relationship, and family history. 

In my own family we suffered under the abuse of a narcacisst father who clipped our wings throughout life for his own sense of power. In Sarah's family her Mother has borderline personality disorder, and essentially belittles her to the point of breakdown. 

My family is ripe with financial insecurity, as we rest right above the poverty line. In Sarah's family they are holding onto their house with pennies, and are on the verge of serious changes.

Sarah is the breadwinner of her family, with the whole family relying on her. I am the glue of my family, and the only thing keeping us from falling into the cracks.

My ex Abby was babied her entire life, never faced serious adversity, and essentially had a princess complex, which produced scenarios very pressing on me. Sarah's ex is litterally well known in our networks as being the wealthiest person we personally know, he frequently put her down for her lack of ""class"" making her feel like she wasnt good enough. You get the picture. These experiences created in us an incredibly intimate bond. It's like we share the same soul. We often joke that we are the same person, as we have countless other similarities.

Sarah's family home is basically on the verge of being lost, as the family is scraping by to keep it out of foreclosure. As a result she is stuck in an endless loop where she is forced to give up her savings every few months to keep the house. The pressure is eating her alive, and its beginning to show.

About 6 weeks ago she surrendered her savings and had a breakdown. I hadnt seen her in a few weeks and she begged to come see me. I obliged and she came to see me at my Mom's house. I could immediately tell something was off as she came with alcohol, and she rarely drinks. Furthermore, after having barely a beer she passed out on my Mom's couch, and became difficult to wake up.

With enough pressure she admitted that she took an excessive amount of her anxiety medication. This freaked me out and terrified me for a few reasons. First, its obviously irresponsible. Second, she didnt take it when she got here which means she drove here (an hour away from her) that way. Third, when I pressed her for honesty she couldnt or wouldnt specify exactly how much of the medication she took.

Upon pushing her for information she revealed that she had self-mutilated but cutting her self. She had about 7-10, 2-4 inch long cuts on her leg. Because she was unable to drive, and I was worried for her I had her stay on my Mom's couch for the night. I slept on the floor, and had to call out of my job for the first time since I became re-employed because I was too fucked up over it all to sleep.

The entire thing completely shocked my nervous system, I was worried for her, hurting for her, and in general just felt awful. I think the hardest thing about it was that for me, it highlighted for me just how little I have, how me and my Mom are just barely surviving and I'm struggling tremendously to handle my own life. The entire experience left me feeling like a terrible person, and severely depleted emotionally. It took me about a week to get back to where I was prior.

I took two weeks to myself to try and straighten out my head which hurt Sarah a great deal. I tried to explain to her how it affected me, and she essentially continued begging me for commitment, and continued making her case for how we can help each other. That it hurt her that I wasnt completely supportive of her following this, and that I didnt handle it well.

After taking some time apart and feeling terrible we met, and talked about everything. Sarah again asked for more commitment, and fought for me saying things like; "" We have been spending time together for months, we are perfect together, why cant we just give it a shot, and if it doesnt work just break up?""

Eventually I conceded and agreed to be official with her. Since then things have generally been good, although I should mention that I due to circumstances outside of her I have almost no free time whatsoever. That's a whole different post all together though. So as a result I only see her once a week or so, with her continually pushing me for more time that I physically dont have for myself.

Last weekend we spent the night together in a hotel, and it was generally great. However, she confided that she really wanted to move and get a place with me. This has completely sent my head into a whirlwind, It scares me because I am nowhere near that point. I was barely ready for this, and I'm struggling in every other area of my life. The truth is I'm still processing the ten years I spent with Abby, and I'm confused like I cant think straight about anything anymore.

On paper I feel like we make too much sense together. One thing that I'm finding difficult to process is the fact that with Abby I always felt like I wasnt good enough. I always felt like I was walking on egg shells, and that I was a failure. With Abby our relationship was littered with problems. We never saw eye to eye on anything. However, with Sarah outside of the more outrageous issues in our personal lives everything is completely copascetic and we align perfectly.

I dont know what to do, or what to think. Please talk to me.

**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary/question

I had a mental breakdown that resulted in my ex-fiancee leaving me a year ago. Following that I went through 8 months of turmoil, grief, and considered ending my life. Eventually, an old friend stepped back into my life named Sarah. We became lovers but clashed over commitment as I was not ready to commit. She continually pressured me, and following some dramatic events I conceded. Outside of this we are nearly perfect together, however I am struggling tremendously in my own life. I feel like I'm going crazy because I'm still being vaguely pressed for more. Its like trying to squeeze blood out of stone. I have nothing for myself, and am becoming more and more confused as time goes on. I need advice, I need someone to talk to me. I feel horrible like I should be able to figure this out on my own, but I cant.",2020.0,3.0,11.0,23:55:12,victim,10
614,4,8,Broke up with my boyfriend (23m) today because of my parents. How do I (24f) get out of this abusive family dynamic?,4.0,g8uvvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/g8uvvg/broke_up_with_my_boyfriend_23m_today_because_of/,5.0,1587996212.0,"Today I broke up
Today I broke up. It was my 24th birthday. I ended my three year relationship with my boyfriend over Facebook video call and messenger. My parents were strongly against our relationship with every grain of their being. I’ve been with them in quarantine for the past month. My mom and I were having a conversation about my housing situation in my university town when she felt that I was disrespecting her (I wasn’t, I was just voicing that I disagreed with her on something). 
The conversation turned to how she felt I’d changed over the years since I started seeing my now ex-boyfriend. That’s when she started her 4 hour long yelling session about why she would never approve and why I needed to end it or else. She said that my relationship with my boyfriend was causing me to be disrespectful and hateful to her. Every time I tried to explain my point of view or how I felt, she would find something wrong with my response — either I was trailing off, too quiet, paused too much or I was lying or I needed to be educated. When I said that she wasn’t listening to me, she would say that she was trying to but there was something wrong with the way I was communicating. She came up with an ultimatum that I would break up with him either today on my birthday or the next day. My dad was on her side every step of the way. 
This conversation isn’t the worst one we’ve had. It’s the cumulation of 3 years of conversations much worse. In the beginning, it was physical with the slaps, punches, and kicks. Nothing leaving marks, but really terrifying and emotionally damaging because they would say the worst things at the same time. One of those conversations happened on the night of my grad ball and I showed up with no makeup because I’d cried it all off beforehand. When I showed them I was still not listening, they turned to financial threats to stop supporting me with tuition or to kick me out. In the past year, it was a bit better as I emphasized that I had the right to make my own decisions about my life and I stood my ground. They didn’t agree, but they let it lie. Still, there would be constant disparaging remarks against my ex that I’d have to stop. They called him names (they made up one name “toad” and would only refer to him by that name). It got to the point where they would say the meanest things about him (calling him ugly, evil, etc other things that I don’t want to repeat) and it was just constant day after day. It got better when I moved away from school, but now that I’m back because of the lockdown it’s much much much worse again. 
For the entire three years we were together, my ex has never once done me harm. He would always support me emotionally, help me when I was struggling with my family, travel hours just to visit me between work weeks, take care of me when I was feeling down, try his best to protect me. He showed me this kind of love that I’d never experienced before. He was always generous, patient, and kind. I was a better person because of him. I’m so sad that he’s gone from my life, but at the same time I think it’s best if he moves on because it won’t work out with me. I told my parents all this but they say I don’t know the real him — that men are all deceitful before marriage and that he’s really a bad person underneath... but I have never ever glimpsed that side of him. 
While I was waiting for my ex to get online so I could break the news to him, my parents watched as I cried and kept on talking about how I needed to break up now. This went on my entire birthday dinner with my tears and snot dripping into my plate. My mom seemed to be calmer but then she insisted we do a toast even though I was bawling at that point and I angrily clanked my glass up against hers and drank my water. This caused her to throw another fit about how I didn’t respect her, how I hated her, how I couldn’t even thank her for making my birthday dinner. I was so angry but she made me feel as if I couldn’t be angry with how she treated me just because of the fact that she had made me a big dinner. Then, while I was still bawling she made me take out cake that she had bought and cut it. She tried to guilt trip me by saying she had to go out in the rain to buy this cake even though I had told her I didn’t want a cake this morning. 
My goal now is to get myself off the ground financially and somehow move out, but I’m poor and have no career and I’m in so much student debt. I can’t see a light at the end of this tunnel and I’m so depressed. It feels like there’s no end in sight and I will be controlled by them forever. I’m so sad that I lost my best friend and lover today and one of the only people I trusted and confided in. How do I get out of this situation? It’s so much more complicated than what I’ve typed out because it’s not always this bad and because my parents have sacrificed so much for me. I know they love me in their own way, but it is just so twisted. I’m an immigrant and I have no other family here, if that makes a difference to this situation. At the same time, there are so many instances of abuse that I just don’t think I can stand it much longer. I’m too weak to leave and I don’t know what my plan should be. Please help and tell me what your plan would be in my situation. It doesn’t need to be the fastest plan, just a safe one that will cause minimal damage to my family.

TL;DR: My parents highly disapprove of my boyfriend of three years and my mom decided that today (my birthday) was the day I needed to end it with him. I did it and I don’t intend to go back to him but I’m wondering how I can get myself out of this emotionally abusive family dynamic?",2020.0,4.0,27.0,19:48:32,victim,24
615,5,9,How do I [30 F] tell my partner [33 M] to stop being verbally abusive and stop making me look bad in front of his friends and family?,1.0,g8z90x,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/g8z90x/how_do_i_30_f_tell_my_partner_33_m_to_stop_being/,10.0,1588016981.0,"Sorry I’m reposting again as my post was previously taken down for containing the b word. 

Me and my partner have been together for around 3 and a half years, he even proposed last year. We’ve been in a LDR as he is trying to relocate and get a visa to be with me (he’s currently in Aus and I’m in the UK), but we regularly travel to be with and see each other.

It’s been great at times and sometimes it’s been shit. He was abusive (verbal and emotional) around 6 weeks in to the relationship and this continued for 2 years, even though it somewhat reduced after me telling him and calling him out on it. There are still times when he continues to be verbally and emotionally abusive. 

I have, from my vantage point and by his admission, been a great partner to him (sure I have my shortcomings and I am not perfect, I’ll get in to that in a moment). For instance, I am always supportive, babe always been there emotionally, I’m affectionate, I always show my love by paying for things and buying things. I extend this love to his parents (whom I love dearly as my own dad passed 10 years ago, and I have a very difficult and strained relationship with my own mum); I show them a lot of respect, I do as much as I can for them in my own way and within my means. He has and they have been appreciative, however, when shit hits the fan he seems to forget everything and can be the most disgustingly acidic person and so abusive verbally (his words are really cutting and have over the years have lowered my confidence, self-esteem, caused me PTSD, depression and anxiety, as well as exacerbating my PMDD - I see a therapist). He on the other hand rarely used to get or buy me things at the beginning of the relationship claiming he was struggling financially (even though I later found out that he was still buying things for himself, and here I was prioritising him and sacrificing my own needs and wants - I’d at times buy him things instead of treating myself, and use whatever budget I had for treats on him). Though things are somewhat better now and he does buy me gifts etc (although at times can complain and at times can still put himself first). 

From the beginning of 2019 he began to change a lot: became more considerate, loving and affectionate (he wasn’t loving or affectionate before, and anything could trigger him to blow off at me and go from 0 to 100). I saw hope, but then I found out that from the outset of our relationship he had been using dating apps to talk to women and was still doing this. I confronted him about this, he admitted and I forgave him (FYI he always either verbally abuses me, does something majorly wrong against me like above, and then just apologises with a letter and I let him off. There’s not much else he does to make it up to me and comfort me, neither does he understand that I need time to move on from the shit he does and forces and rushes me to “get over it”). 

When we argue he always interrupts me, talks disrespectfully in the background (sighs, mutters under his breath, etc), speaks over me and invalidates my truth and experience. When he talks I give him space to talk without interrupting him (sometimes I interject but I apologise and then let him proceed), let him vent, let him say what he has to and then try to respond/tell my side if I’m allowed to. Problem is he always wants to end the conversation when he’s done talking, which almost always means I’ve been left unheard and for me this conflict hasn’t been resolved as I haven’t been understood. He also always wants to brush conflicts under the carpet without ever bringing them up again, which means a lot of stuff is unresolved and causes a lot of resentment and anger to build up within me. When I try to bring something up to resolve it, he’ll say I’m digging stuff up but I’m trying to resolve things as they’ve always been buried and me shut down, and for me those conflicts are still an open oozing wound as I’ve not been heard/understood. If he says “we’ll talk about it later another time/day” he has previously failed to keep this promise and basically it’s been left as is. So when any sort of conflict arises I want to hash it out there, whereas he says he needs space to think and calm himself (he always says I don’t want to talk right now as I’m about to lose my cool), I fail to let him go and insist that we talk now (as I don’t trust he’ll talk about the issue later and will bury it) despite him telling me that he’s really going to lose it, and sure enough he does and starts to verbally abuse me. He says really hurtful things about me, destroys my character and even includes my family in these conflicts; I cry and beg him to stop, but he doesn’t and I can’t walk away from the toxic argument as I just want him to stop being cruel and instead be kind, caring and compassionate in the moment whilst I’m crying so much and hurt. 

He also paints me out to be the witch in front of his friends and parents, making it out that arguments start from me (they really don’t). He’s even swore and said nasty stuff to me in front of them. I feel worthless, devalued and unappreciated. All he does after all this is simply apologise and write me a letter, he expects me and things to be normal in a few days and me to forget about it. But it leaves a lasting impact. 

For example, yesterday we had a petty disagreement and he went zero to hundred because I was using a “whingey, whiney tone” ( I was frustrated, I wasn’t shouting at him or saying anything mean to him - this he admitted and said he simply doesn’t like that tone as it makes him feel like a kid and as though he’s in trouble). He did tell me a few times to change my tone, and I did but then he started to interrupt me again and refuse to let me get my side across, hence again in frustration my tone changed to being “whiney and whingey again”. He said he would like to go, and pause the argument because he is very upset and is about to loose his shit. I insisted he stay and hash it out, he lost it and got verbally abusive again. He was at his parents (and considering he’s previously involved them in our arguments and made me look like the bad guy) and I decided to text his mum to tell him to stop being cruel and nasty to me, then I called her. Instead of answering the call or responding to my texts, she went and gave him the phone (he blocked me on her phone) and got even more abusive. He then went and told them to log out of my Netflix account making it out as though this case from me, it didn’t. 

I feel devalued by his parents because I feel they don’t check his behaviour and always take his side. 

I feel he doesn’t respect, value or appreciate me. 

I feel like he always paints me to be the bad guy in front of his parents and friends. 

What do I do?

TLDR: partner verbally abusive and likes to bury issues rather than resolve; feel unappreciated, disrespected and devalued by him and to some extend his parents (who I make a lot of effort with); he portrays me as the witch and instigator to his parents and friends.",2020.0,4.0,28.0,01:34:41,victim,10

Bob and Mary dated and were engaged and married within one year. We were very supportive and warm and welcoming to him, as his family was to ours. Within 2 years, we started hearing some concerning stories. Cops were being called, he was abusing OTC medications, and couldn't hold down a job. He often avoided family events, which worked well for us. Bob and Mary had a child. He does not parent much and is unable to watch the child, so even though he's home without a job, Mary drops off the child to daycare (before this plague started of course). 

Bob started being intimidating and threatening towards Mary. He would throw objects, which apparently never hit her, yet hit the walls around her. He allegedly never laid a finger on her. He's apparently been to therapy, but we are doubtful he has addressed the issues that need to be addressed. She moved out for a bit, and lawyered up, yet still visited and pretended they were together. He would have moments of rage that other family members witnessed and questioned, like throwing a highchair (with no baby in it).  We were all hearbroken when she moved back in with him after a year of separation. No one has seen him for two years, though she recently started sending out family pictures of them. 

Due to this lovely pandemic, we are doing family video chats. We are surprised he's made an appearance, and we are unsure how to engage with him. He plans to come to a family wedding in a few months, though it will likely be cancelled given everything. We have previously spoken to her about supporting her leaving him etc, but she seems to think we have turned against Bob. We also doubt we have heard the full extend of the abuse. She has been given support and resources in so many ways. I know it can take many times to leave, and I understand it's not my decision if she stays or goes. 

We all have so many mixed feelings about his re-integration with family events. On one hand, it seems artificial to pretend nothing happened. On the other hand, it's her choice, though a few people have offered their opinions and continued support of her independence when asked. Now that he seems to be re-entering the family via video and eventually events, what's the best approach? I feel like being passive aggressive is obviously not appropriate, but being warm and friendly also seems disingenuous.

I'm  a gay trans man attending college far from my hometown. I'm not out to  my family, but I'm out to pretty much everyone else. In around November,  I got a Tinder and matched with the amazing guy I'm currently dating.  We've been together for almost four months now, and spend a lot of time  together - unfortunately, I haven't told my parents about him yet  despite having a somewhat close relationship with them. This is for a  few reasons.

1. They're  abusive. My mother (52F) is a crazy control freak and will stop at  nothing to get me to do what she wants. This has led to physical abuse  many, many times in the past, and only recently stopped when I moved  into the dorms. My dad (53M) isn't very willing to risk his own neck to  get her to stop, so the situation has just stayed the same for the past  18 years of my life. The last time I dated someone, I had my phone taken  away and gone through and my laptop was constantly monitored. My  parents stalked me every time I left the house to hang out with friends  so they could make sure I wasn't with my boyfriend.
2. My  boyfriend is Mexican. My parents are typical racist Bay Area Asians,  and so they won't entertain the thought of me dating someone outside the  culture for even a second. My dad has previously expressed that he's  okay with me dating outside my race since this is 21st-century America,  but whenever I bring up the subject of my boyfriend (they think he's  just my friend who I have a crush on), he gets really uncomfortable and  starts talking about how Mexicans eat meat and so it's impossible to  have a relationship with them. I'm a vegetarian but personally have no  problem with my boyfriend's diet. My boyfriend is also extremely  respectful and considerate of my dietary restrictions.
3. It  hasn't been long enough yet. My parents will flip out if I tell them  after the 1-year mark because the relationship is no longer under their  control, but they'll also flip out and try to get me to break up with my  boyfriend if I tell them too *early.* I'm kind of trapped right now.

This  would all be okay if things were proceeding as normal, because I  could've figured something out, but due to the COVID-19 crisis my  college is shutting down and sending me home for six whole months. It's  going to be really difficult keeping our relationship secret for that  long (we live 400 miles apart), and I also would barely be able to  contact my boyfriend at all because of how controlling my parents are. I  want to tell them so I can work it out with them and possibly have him  visit me/go visit him during the summer, but I'm not sure how or when to  go about it. Does anyone else have experience with something like this?  How did you tell your parents, if at all? What would be the safest  option for me?

618,9,16,When should I tell someone I’m dating about my extremely abusive family?,0.0,fv9bhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fv9bhg/when_should_i_tell_someone_im_dating_about_my/,1.0,1586097079.0,"Just a note, many things in this may not make sense to you while reading this (eg why have I never just called the police/ moved out earlier). I know it doesn’t make sense, but being abused at this level for this amount of time really messes with people’s brains. Also the physical abuse is a lot less now, I keep a chair under my door handle and a knife on my bedside table/ in my pocket in case I need to use it (so overall I'm fine, I won't die).

For a little context, I (21F) met a guy (22M) a little over a month ago and we’ve been going on dates every 5 days or so since then. He’s consistently made it very clear that he likes me a lot. He comes from an upper-class, well off family of doctors and successful people, he’s not snooty or anything but he’s admitted to not going through much trauma (his family and extended family are very good people and have treated him well). This ofc is great for me if I can marry into a family of good and kind people, but I don’t know when to tell him, or how to tell him.

My family (mother, father, brother) are all, and have always been very nasty and violent towards me, so much so that I can’t even leave my room without mockery, harassment, and threats of violence (I still do leave my room though to shower and get food, but I can’t stay outside my room for long). They are all (undiagnosed) very mentally ill and twisted, they have convinced themselves since my birth that I was somehow the ‘bad guy’ (no I am not over exaggerating my mum once complained (in all seriousness) that I have always picked fights, ever since I was a baby!!!!! BABY!!!!).

I’ve pretty much endured every kind of abuse possible from these people, some of it is even funny how messed up and random it is (like my mother forcefully holding me down and letting my brother pee on me when I was like 9 because I called him a ‘weiner’). Most of the abuse I’ve endured from them is so extreme and crazy that no one would actually believe it, as you reading this now are probably questioning the severity of it. From 15 and under, my family (obviously) had abused and gaslit me so much that they made me believe that if I called the police, I’d go to jail too because I threatened to break their things, or hit back, or it was my fault my dad beat me bloody because I called my mum a b\*tch. They have also slandered and lied about me to my extended family since forever (yes my aunts and stuff have picked up on it and have guessed my family is abusive). Because of this constant poo-talking, I’ve had no relationship with any outside members of my family, which means I have had no one to go to.

Obviously, I need to get out of this situation, I’m in my final year of university, once I graduate next year I’ll move out, get a job, and cut them out completely, maybe legally if I can.

TLDR;

Obviously my home life is very very bad so my questions are these;

How do I tell someone who clearly cares for me so much that my family is this bad, and that I’m consistently in danger but won’t leave because one more year of abusive is nothing to a lifetime of it?

How do I tell him that I never want him to meet them?

How do I tell him everything? Or should I not?",2020.0,4.0,5.0,20:16:19,victim,21

So in the past month my older brother's fiancee left him. This meant he lost his house because the home they lived in was in her name. He lost his vehicle because what he was driving was her old car. He also lost his job because he was so focused on his breakup that he was constantly making mistakes. He moved in with our parents who live about 5 minutes away from my husband and I.

I DO have a lot of sympathy for him. He literally has nothing, no home, no car, no job, no relationship. The problem is, this is third time this has happened to him. That's right, he has had 3 fiancees leave him now and every time he winds up losing everything. He has had two cars impounded because he gets so upset over his breakups he loses his job and can't make payments on his vehicles. My parents and I have bailed him out of these situations every time. I even paid off his back payments on his car, paid for his dog's vet bills, AND paid some of his rent before. My parents and I have literally spent thousands of dollars trying to 'help' him. Each of the past two times he winds up moving back in with my parents who are in their late 60s.

While we pay for everything for him whenever he goes through a breakup he becomes a total jerk. He spends every weekend with his friends out camping or vacationing (how he pays for it I have no idea, after the second fiancee he took a trip to Fiji with his friends but couldn't afford to pay his rent). He mostly ignores me unless he needs money, which, during this breakup I am refusing to help him out at all. The worst part is he treats my parents like garbage. If they ask him questions like, ""have you been looking for a job?"" he will yell at them. He has no problem eating the food they provide for him and living in their house rent and utility free, and driving my mom's brand new car (which she got because he totaled her last car) but makes them absolutely miserable. My mom told me he will yell at them, call her stupid, trashes their house, sleeps all day, and leaves the care of his dog up to them. Every time I see my mom lately it's obvious that she's been crying.

The most recent event took place on Sunday. In an attempt to get him out of the house for a while I offered to take him out in our boat. He seemed super excited about it and when he's excited he can actually be a lot of fun to be around. He tells me he's hanging out with friends but will be back in town Sunday afternoon. Sunday afternoon rolls around and he's nowhere to be seen. I get a text around 6pm that he's decided to go to a local tourist destination with all his friends, they are going to tube down a river. I'm bummed because I was honestly looking forward to it and because my brother has once again chosen his friends over his family. But it's whatever, I honestly don't rely on him for anything so it's not that big of deal. But then I find out he's driving my mom's car and she has to be in her office early Monday morning. Then the peaceful protests in our town turn into full on riots and my brother is still not home. At this point he can't get home because they've blocked off access to our town so he just stays with his friends and I wind up taking my mom to work. My Dad tries to talk to my brother on Monday about how irresponsible he was and my brother just yells at him and then locks himself in my parents basement for the rest of the day.

My parents are miserable. They want to help and have always said they will do anything for us kids, but they are just enabling my brother every time they bail him out. My Dad has major health problems that are being exacerbated by the stress my brother is causing. My mom has a history of severe depression that I see her slipping back into the longer my brother is with them. I'm really close to my parents and they are usually very fun people. The longer my brother stays with them I am seeing them become depressed, short-tempered, and miserable. I tried telling them to kick him out, one of his friends would surely take him in, but they insist that they don't want to leave him homeless. I can't convince them to kick them out but is there anything else I can say or do that might get my brother to get his head out his ass and get a job? How can I get my brother to see his behavior towards my parents is unacceptable?

It just sucks, I used to really look up to my older brother because he is outgoing and funny and the sort of person everyone just gravitates towards. Now I'm just pissed at him for how he treats my parents and simultaneously scared for his mental health because he clearly has a lot of problems.

&#x200B;

tl;dr Older brother lost his fiancee, house, car, and job. My parents took him in and he is now treating them like garbage.

&#x200B;

\*\*UPDATE\*\* Thank you for the responses. A couple of things: I am in no position to psychoanalyze my brother or parents, but I do believe that mental health is a primary reason for how any human acts the way they do and clearly my brother's mental health is not good. I am encouraging my family to see therapists, but decided I will not be paying for my brother's because there is truly no telling if he would go or be willing to change. Also, my mom works for a not-for-profit for the elderly and specializes in elderly abuse cases. She told me that she knows what he is doing is 'technically' elder abuse, but she does not want to report it or want me to report it. If things get any worse though, I will go behind her back. 

I went to my parents house last night for an unrelated reason and had a brief talk with my brother that devolved into a shouting match. I started by showing him four different jobs I found online that he could apply for, but none of them were 'good enough' for him. He was 'insulted' that I thought he would work those jobs and that's when the shouting match started. I'm an educator, I KNOW I shouldn't have let myself get into a power struggle with him, but siblings just know how to push your buttons, you know?

ANYWAY, I was able to talk to my mom one on one and she is totally unwilling to do anything about him. She will not even give him a deadline of when he has to have a job, nor will she stop lending him her car. She also reiterated how miserable she is in her own home with him around, but insists she's feels so bad for him she doesn't want to force him to do anything. 

So I told her that I am done with him, and I will not be spending any time at their house as long as they continue to let him drain them of their health, finances, and mental well-being. I told her she and Dad are welcome at my house any time, but my brother is not. I have to tell you, I have never felt like a shittier person, it's not in my nature to just give up on people.

EDIT: My father talked to me because he felt that I was distant. I'm not saying that approve of what he did but, I'm glad he talked to me. I was afraid he would leave us ( kids). He's my dad and as painful as it is to my mother, as much as I love her, I can understand that being in a 27 year old relationship with no one to talk to is hard. Cheating is definitely not the answer but I'm just glad I am not mad at my dad anymore. This might be confusing but at least I kind of got closure. Thank you all for your helpful comments. 

Long story short, my parents told my siblings and I that they were fighting, and that everything will be okay between them so we don't need to worry. I had figured out a few says earlier what it was about but my siblings don't know. 
My mom kind of confirmed to me that my dad was  cheating and I wish I never knew what happened. I wish I could just think that they're fighting, and nothing more. I'm angry at my dad for making my mother so depressed that she had to go on medication that I used to take when I couldn't get out of bed. Seeing those boxes of pills in her bathroom was unbearable for me. I always thought of my dad as a someone who'd never do that. On top of that, my mom told me that ""these kind of things happen in a marriage"" and that I should not be mad at him at all. 
I feel like my feelings are not meant to be since my mom forgave him, but it is hard for me. 

Sorry if this post is a mess .

She's helped me out a lot, and I was not really in a great place when we met, but she sort of lifted me up and made me much happier than I have ever really been. Despite our age difference, we got along well right when we met, and I never really felt out of place around her until a few months ago. 

Since about November, she has been putting me down and I just feel bad about myself sometimes. She's always teased me, but I feel like it has gotten mean. She makes little jabs about how I did not finish highschool (I dropped out in 11th grade) and she talks about how she is the smart one in our relationship. I admit she is smarter than I am. She has a good job and all, but it sometimes feels like she looks down on me for my own lack of capability. She even makes these kind of comments in front of her friends. I don't even get along with her friends, and I've never felt that they've liked me at all. They've even said things about me. 

During the quarantine all of this has gotten worse. She hasn't said anything kind to me at all. She makes fun of me, and she gives me no slack at all with her expectations of me. I don't mind doing most of the housework. I lost my restaurant job, and she works alot,and even before the virus, she was the one who took care of all the house finances. I still wish she would show some sort of appreciation. If I mess up one thing or forget anything, she just get angry. One compliment on a meal would be nice and I feel stupid for expecting that because I know I should appreciate all she does without  me expecting praise from her. But I feel worthless lately. I like cooking for her and all that but she just acts pissy if things are not what she expected.

She makes me so happy is the thing. I love her, and spending time with her is the best time I've had, but I don't think she feels the same for me anymore. I've tried to bring this all up with her, and she just tells me I'm being silly or whatever or she gets annoyed and tells me to trust that she loves me. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm not allowed to have my own thing. Like I cannot explore my hobbies or interests. I like music but she put me down about it. She doesn't say anything mean but she tells me that its not worth it orshe just smiles and rolls her eyes. She has her own things with friends out of work, but it's like I cant do a single thing if she doesn't think it is worth our time. 

I just feel dumb all the time, and I used to feel good about myself when we first met, but I don't know anything and I can't do anything myself.

My fiance does this alot. If he's stressing he's always moody towards me. He talks to me about what's bothering him, but he has his voice raised as he's doing it and brings his bad mood with him when we see each other.

I'm a very kind person so in the years we've been together which is 9 years, I always hold him, comfort him, and remind him I love him, but if he's in a bad mood none of it matters and he even ignores my texts even if I didn't do anything wrong to him nor did I have anything to do with what set him in a bad mood.

He's also a really moody guy and has trouble with stress, so if he has like 2 things he needs to get done, he dwells on it and is so cranky until like the next day.


Yesterday is an example of this, he had to work a little longer, until about 5pm and he has to fix his work truck on his day off today and help his aunt out with something so he was angry because instead of relaxing, he has to get up early to do that stuff.

I even sent him a goodnight text last night letting him know I love him and I'm here for him, and I sent one this morning too basically saying the same thing and he totally ignored me. :/ 


It doesn't help that he works with his dad on Saturdays and it's brutal hard labor, so after work I either leave him alone and don't bother seeing him or if he does wanna talk it's to tell me how angry at the world he is because he has to help his dad and the work day is insane awful. We don't live together yet for cultural reasons and when he's in a bad mood he tells me to cancel all the work I've done on our wedding plans so we can just go to court, get the marriage license and he can move out. But when he's in a good mood he's happy about our wedding plans so what the heck?

I also have to be strong because if I get emotional, he gets more upset and he thinks it's another thing he has to take care of which is to make me stop getting emotional which isn't the case.

How can I deal with this? What can I do for someone that gets stressed so easily or what can I say to even make him realize I'm here for him? I've even been doing most of the wedding planning on my own just so he doesn't stress about it.

Thanks!

My partner (35M) tells me I have mental issues when I ask for alone time.,19.0,gqii2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gqii2z/i_29f_have_anxiety_since_having_my_first_kid_my/,42.0,1590466821.0,"*Edit: I've made an appointment referral with my GP to speak with a specialist. Thank you for your comments, Would love to hear more about other people's experiences with anxiety and their relationships with their partners, especially new mom's. Hearing other people's struggles does help me feel a little less shame about all of this. 🙏🏻

I've been with my partner for 10 years and we just had our first child last June. I've always had a little anxiety but I would usually smoke a little weed and it would help a lot with it. Now however, I'm struggling everyday with it and it's really effecting my self worth. I feel ashamed that I have this problem but I think it's stems from a complex number of factors including my childhood and how my partner treats me from the day to day. 

For instance today I had an episode that started because he was upset that he said something to me and I was distracted and didn't hear him which set him off on a long lecture. He goes into these lectures quite often when I do things he doesn't like and I find it very hard to sit through, sometimes it last over an hour of just him talking. I understand he's upset but I don't do well with someone just talking at me and not letting me speak but complaining when I don't try either. When I do try he talks over me and I feel defeated and unable to participate normally in the conversation.

When I feel strong anxiety I try to go into my safe space and find a quiet place to center myself. The problem is he will follow me around the house telling me I have mental problems, when I lock the bathroom door he will take a screw driver and open it. 

Yesterday was the scariest, I was having another anxiety attack like I couldn't breath and he was laying into me like usual but I was feeding my baby and she was being fussy. All of a sudden I just snapped and throw a pot I was using to cook oatmeal in, into the sink and tried to just GTFO the house to clear my head. Unfortunately he decided to physically stop me and our baby had to watch on as I struggled out the door. 

I feel horrible more for my LO than I do for myself. I don't want to break our family up or put my child through trauma if I can avoid it. I still love him I just have a hard time dealing with him sometimes and my anxiety seems to be the route of many of our arguments.

When I spoke to my doctor about medication he told me I had to make another appointment to which I did and then he never got back to me about it. I am embarrassed about this and have a hard time making myself follow up with him on this. My dear is if I ask for medication I will not feel my regular self, and this is a problem for me as I am an artist and designer and my moods effect my work. 
If there something else I can do to help with our arguments and my anxiety issues.

TL;DR: I (29F) have bad anxiety issues since having my our first kid and it's effecting my relationship with my SO(35M). I feel ashamed and am feeling unsure about going on medication for it. I want to know if there is another way to help me cope. Is it all just me?",2020.0,5.0,26.0,10:05:21,victim,10

How much do I put up with until enough is enough?,57.0,gld46s,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gld46s/my_38_wifes_36_father_has_continued_to_try_to/,43.0,1589739620.0,"I'm  trying to be respectful of the relationship my wife has with her father, but the man has been nothing but negative behind my back for more than a decade. My wife and I have a very healthy relationship and  she tells me everything. When she grew up, her father was always making her mother feel stupid or crazy, never taking accountability for his own  actions. He was easily embarrassed and had a lot of pride issues. They have since divorced and he is newly remarried. He always talks shit about his wife behind her back, as well as his step-son. You can often find him arguing on the phone with his wife as well. He can show kindness and will go way overboard to show his affection. However, when you do anything that isn't exactly how he wants or you disagree with  him, he gets really frustrated.

When my wife was young, he was quick to tell her to shut up or be quiet if she ever voiced her opinion. It took a very long time for her to feel comfortable with me and to find her voice. She is assertive now with her father and I think that bothers him greatly. To give an example of some of his bizarre and exhausting behavior, he was assisting us with watching our child and stayed with us while things are closed during the pandemic. One of the other grandparents was watching our child at their home and he had departed for the day. When he arrived home, the front door was locked. He didn't take a set of keys with him, didn't use the doorbell, and got really frustrated. When we finally heard him knocking,  we opened the door and let him in. Later, we found him packing up everything saying he was leaving. Confused, we asked why. He said we locked him out on purpose. Even after explaining that this wasn't the case, it took my wife 30 minutes to get him to calm down. There was another incident where our child was playing, talking to me, and he was really rude about me not giving him eye contact while talking to me. I had to explain to him later that as my child was talking to me, I needed to give her eye contact. I can still listen to him without eye contact. Plus, he was talking about some bullshit anyway.

At any rate, one of the other grandparents was going to be unavailable and my father in law made up some bullshit about that he couldn't watch our child during the day while we had to work. When my wife asked what the  situation was, he got really defensive, and then proceeded to say, ""Well, what is \[my name\] doing?"" I have a very demanding job, but given my father in law's age and ignorance about working from home, I don't expect him to understand. Anyway, this really pissed off my wife and it  caused an argument between the two of them. He proceeded to then leave our house to stay at one of his friend's in the area. We were able to reconcile, but found out later that he made some pretty outlandish claims the next day that we were going to steal my mother in law's money (she has none so this is ludicrous and we both have well paying jobs). It was bizarre. When confronted, he hung up on my wife. She made several attempts to get to the bottom of this, but he continued to be a coward and avoid contact. He finally responded and went on this long rant about how my wife is unwell and needs therapy. He then said in so many words that I am crazy, my family is crazy, and that we have made her unwell. He also spun some weird lie about the money statement, but didn't really address it. It was a really sad excuse of an argument.

This has been going on for over a decade where he is displeased about whatever or who even knows what provokes him and will proceed to in private talk shit about me. When my wife blows him off he will try to gaslight the hell out of her. I'm just exhausted with this because there seems to be love there somewhere, even for me, but I can't understand his behavior. I don't understand his endgame. At what point, can you just label someone toxic and be done with them? I don't want to have to explain this kind of dysfunction to our child. My wife is more or less just let down by this, but always is supportive of me. My wife took a break from talking to him when he got super irrational leading up to his divorce as well as accusing us of secretly getting married. He seemed to had made great strides at being a better person, but it appears it was all an act. Do I just continue to be the bigger person so that our child has a relationship with her grandfather? So that my wife isn't caught in this weird middle situation? How can I even trust this guy? What is truly important here?

&#x200B;

TLDR My father in law is always telling my wife behind my back that I am not a good husband. When she disagrees, he proceeds to gaslight her. Do I owe it to my wife to always be okay with this constant sabotaging of our marriage? Do I owe it to my child to be the bigger person and let her know her grandfather?",2020.0,5.0,18.0,00:05:20,victim,30

Thanks to the people who responded to my post. I can safely say that you were all right and I apologize for being so defensive of my girlfriend, now ex, and for being hard headed in my replies to you all. 

I looked into another subreddit for people in relationships with narcissists, and the people there echoed what you all told me. My relationship was abusive from the start. It has been hard to wrap my head around that because I definitly wanted her when I met her, but I was 17.  I can accept that what she did was inappropriate. She got me away from my abusive family, but that does not change that she has treated me terribly and just been manipulative. 

I still was not going to for sure leave her. I wanted to talk to hear about it all. I brought my feelings up with her and she lost it on me. I've never really seen her so angry. She yelled at me for reaching out to strangers online for advice about our relationship. She said that it was a betrayal. She insulted me a bunch, much more than she usually does. I was told that if I left that I wouldnt make it. She said that no women would be satisfied with me in bed and that I've been a disappointment sexually since we met (when I was 17) and that I brought nothing worthwhile physically. 

This was seriously strange to me. As mean as she could sometimes be, she has never just freaked out and screamed like this.

I told her that I didn't want to leave her but that I just wanted to be able to do things that I enjoyed and not be talked to like I was stupid. She of course told me that I was stupid and that other people would just lie to me. 

This is when I did something that I'm actually proud of myself for. I called the only friend I have nearby, and I asked if I could stay the night there. I was not going to let her beat me down like that. This friend has never been too fond of her because he says she always treated me badly. I called her the next day and she jumped between begging me to come back and insulting me. She threatened to tell people ""how badly I treated her."" I've never yelled at her. I've never gotten aggressive with her, so she is just going to lie to people now. 

My friend then offered to let me stay with him for a while until I can get a bit secure. 

I've been back to her place only once to get most of my things, and again she went back and fourth from being overly sweet, insulting me, and out right threatening me before slapping me when I told her that she was being crazy. I have a few more things at her place, but I really don't want to see her again, so I'm considering just calling that a loss. At least I'm away from her. 

I say all of that and still miss her. Dumb. Yeah. I feel like I lost what could have been good years by being with her, but I know that she also helped me out a lot. I don't know how to feel, but I know I'm better away from her. 

Thanks again for your encouragement and for making me see what she was doing to me.

So, I woke up to my fiancée being dead on Wednesday, April 1st 2020. She died unexpectedly and I don't want to go into the details of her death with strangers yet but it has been the largest, most traumatic event of my life. On the first day, I called her parents (50s M/F) who came and picked me up to stay with them for a week because my parents lived across the country and I just couldn't handle being alone in our apartment anymore. Me and her family, which are very kind and accepting people, grieved together and comforted each other. They were extremely sweet and kind people and I was very lucky to get to stay with them when it first happened. 

However, my parents were also informed of my fiancée's death and made the long, multiple day drive across the country to come. They packed up my apartment for me because I just couldn't go back there (which was very kind of them) and picked me up the night after her funeral to take me to my childhood home. The first thing my mom did was complain about her own problems and how disrespectful/inconsiderate I was to not thank her right away or something. I don't really remember exactly what it was about but I didn't have the energy to argue or put up with her so I just mumbled some answers and tried to remain quiet.

Then, later in the night as we were trying to go to sleep, my mom decided to start asking why my fiancée didn't care for her that much and I explained it was because she is homophobic. My mom then went into a huge screaming tirade about how she didn't want her daughter to be a lesbian (I remember her actual quote being ""Well, I'm sorry that I don't want my daughter to become a lesbian!"") and how us holding hands when she visited us last year was extremely disrespectful. (When she visited us last yet, she made my fiancée break down and cry so hard I had to drive my fiancée somewhere to be without my mom for an extended period of time.) I just cried quietly to myself until she stopped screaming and we went to sleep.

Around the first few days after my fiancée's death, I would wake up crying and in a panic. Her parents would just hug me and we would cry and talk until I was able to calm down, but my mom that morning reacted by screaming at me. She was saying things like ""Stop crying!"" and ""I hate [fiancée] now!"" and ""If she was alive, I'd kill her because you just keep crying!"" and just similar stuff. It made everything worse and I just wanted to throw up for the beginning of our long drive home. She also kept taunting me by saying she was going to put me in a mental health hospital or whatever it's called.

On the drive home, she kept bringing up negative topics any chance she got. During all these she called my fiancée a slut and a whore. She said that my fiancée ""looked like someone who would sleep around."" and just tried to disgrace her character. She then tried to convince me that my fiancée was toxic and controlling (she wasn't) and that she must've been abusive because she was driving a wedge between me and my family. It hurt me to even think that fiancée was abusive when she did nothing but care about me and was tender and loving to me.

When I was talking about how smart and beautiful my fiancée was, she kept saying I was smarter and prettier than my fiancée which just made me feel incredibly crappy. Sometimes, she would then have these strange mood swings where she would say ""If I could, I would kill myself so [fiancée] could be alive. That's what you really want, don't you?"" and when she would ask that, she would demand and answer and I just didn't know how to answer and I would end up crying harder. She also kept trying to say she knows what I'm going through and I have to toughen up but she married the first person she ever dated, so she never even went through a breakup before.

She would also continuously joke (?) about how she was going to buy me a blow up doll and dress her in my fiancée's clothes and it just made me feel so sick and uncomfortable and terrible when she would make that joke. She still makes that joke and now has my dad in on it.

When we got home, I thought I was going to stay with my grandparents (70s M/F) but my mom informed me that I would have to stay with her or my sister (20 F) because I might have the Coronavirus and she wouldn't want me to give it to my grandparents, who currently have my emotional support cat at their house because my parents and sister both have dogs. My childhood best friend (20 F) also came over to stay with me for a couple weeks (which is a blessing) but she only feels comfortable staying with my parents because my sister doesn't take good care of her house. So, I'm currently at my parents house.

Anyway, the day I got home, I went to my sister's house for a little bit to get away from my parents but my dad just ended up calling me on my phone and screaming at me that I only have a week (starting from Friday) to cry and get over it, then I would have to work and not be seen moping around or upset about it again. He also continued to call my fiancée a selfish bitch and told me that I needed to forget about her and get on with my life. This made me just break down. I called my ""mother in law"" (for lack of better term) and just cried to her about everything and I think she really doesn't like my parents now. But, she told me that they are just trying to make me feel better by treating this like a breakup. My fiancée's family is extremely religious (but accepting) and so they believe that like people need to be with their blood families to heal, so I think they're just having a difficult time understanding how my parents could be so mean but they're starting to understand every time I talk to them about it. However, they're on the other side of the country and there is nothing they can do about it now anyway other than listen when I call them. My parents don't want me to call them because they say that her family needs to grieve and I'm bothering them so now I'm really worried I'm just bothering her parents.

I also made it clear to my parents that I'm changing my last name to hers because that was our plan when we got married and it was important to me still and at first, when I told them on the phone a few days after she passed, they seemed okay with it but now that I'm here, they're throwing a huge dramatic show about it. They keep screaming about it and telling me that I can't change my name to a slut's name and that nobody would love me if I changed my name to hers and I'm just so worried that maybe they're right but I feel like it's necessary.

My parents' dog also has been growling at me every day because I'm new to him (they got him while I was gone and living with my fiancée) and my dad today yelled at me to stop ""moping around"" so the dog will stop growling at me because he thinks the dog growls at me due to my coldness or something. I don't know. I ended up breaking down in the shower because it's the only place I can be alone anymore (my room doesn't have a door) and I desperately miss my fiancée and the life we made together. 

I'm ashamed that I'm 22 and am living with my parents right now and I'm just depressed and anxious and scared. None of my coping mechanisms I have learned from my depression and anxiety therapist have worked and I don't know what to do anymore. 

What can I do to make my parents more empathetic and caring? I've always been somebody who just needs to be held and told sweet things to when bad stuff happens to make me feel okay again but they're just making everything worse. When I talk to them they just shrug it off. One time, I asked my mom if she could be nicer to me and she said ""I am being nicer than usual."" I don't know what to do anymore. I just need to know what to tell them so they stop all this and become kind and sweet and consoling. I just need it and her family knew I needed it but they, for some reason, don't understand. I've been hugged and cuddled more by my once to-be in-laws than by my own parents after all this happened. Please tell me what to do to get them to understand and treat me better. Or just tell me what I should do. I don't know anymore. I'm struggling.

627,18,59,Should I [30F] tell my brother [34M] that he's gone viral? His ex-wife [30F] published a popular article about how shitty he is.,865.0,gl6gom,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gl6gom/should_i_30f_tell_my_brother_34m_that_hes_gone/,99.0,1589707074.0,"You know how your Android homepage pulls articles it thinks you would like to read into a feed? Today the robots brought me a very dubious present: an apparently popular article featuring my ex-sister-in-law (let's call her Eve) from one of those Facebook-driven clickbait sites. The article is about my brother.

I don't wanna link it, as it uses her real name and photos, but for context, it's got 33,000 shares, and a video that highlights the story has almost 2M views. It's meant to be a love story about her (real) profound struggle to leave her first husband (my brother, who we'll call Jim) to be with her current partner. She seems very happy with the new guy, which is great. But she felt the need to introduce the story by painting my brother as a fat-shaming, dream-crushing, emotionally abusive bastard. She repeatedly returns to her misery as his wife as a refrain.

Let's be clear: Jim's not a fat-shaming, dream-crushing, emotionally abusive bastard, and nothing in this article revealed anything worrying about him to me. (I know more about the situation -- from both Jim and Eve -- than I honestly want to.) Jim feels things very deeply but sucks at talking about it. His big expressions of love usually involve kind acts he never mentions to anyone, and he hates spending money. Eve feels deeply too, but her approaches clashed with his. She always scaled the highs and lows of her life into public epics, and her big expressions of love usually involved big gifts. They got married very young. She walked out on him after 10+ years. They're both much better off. He still blames himself for almost everything.

The melodramatic article is pretty par-for-the-course Eve. But as you might deduce from the above, Jim is a profoundly private person. He cares very much how others see him. I want to curl up and die just thinking about how much he would want to curl up and die reading this article.

Jim and I weren't super close growing up, but we are now. Like a lot of siblings, we're simultaneously polar opposites and the same person. I act more like an Eve than a Jim -- case in point, I'm asking about this on reddit -- but he and I react to emotional situations in very similar ways. If something like this was out there about me, I would want to know, especially since real names and photos are involved in the article. He's not named, but it's a small town. I would be devastated if my loved ones knew and didn't tell me.

I live in another state. I have no idea if he knows about the story. Jim isn't a heavy Facebook user, but it's an important news source to a lot of his friends. My family has a bad habit of hiding things in order to (theoretically) protect loved ones from pain, so I can't really ask them. My personal impulse to tell him is at war with the family habit, and I genuinely don't know which is for the best. Help, kind strangers?

TL/DR: My brother's ex wrote a popular clickbait article outlining how miserable he made her when they were married. My brother is very private and very sensitive. Should I tell him?

\--

EDIT: Thank you all for the advice! I'm calling him tomorrow, after recruiting a close friend who can be there in person (at a socially safe distance) to talk after, plus asking his wife to take the call with him.

Some people have asked about the emotional abuse thing. I'm very, *very* confident about my understanding of our situation, but I'm not comfortable sharing all the gory details here. I've removed a couple of my comments below; I feel like I said too much. I'm trying to avoid attacking Eve's character more than my explanations already do, plus avoid trying to ""prove"" my brother's innocence for people unwilling to take me at my word by dishing out even more stuff about his private life, especially since it's all out of context.

To hopefully satisfy the curiosity a little bit without being too huge an asshole: the article and its content are part of a long, documented pattern of Eve's choices in a variety of life areas. Jim has only had supportive, positive relationships outside this one, and has since gotten remarried to an awesome woman who never hesitates to communicate openly in a healthy way.

BUT people who do report abuse should always be heard and assumed to be honest, and their accusations should be seriously and fairly investigated.",2020.0,5.0,17.0,15:02:54,victim,33
628,19,61,Am I (M 25) always supposed to take my wife (F 24)'s side even if I agree with my mother (F 53),8.0,gmrc19,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gmrc19/am_i_m_25_always_supposed_to_take_my_wife_f_24s/,27.0,1589932835.0," So, I’ve been married to a wonderful woman for three years, and I mean it my wife is incredible. She’s passionate and opinionated, but she really struggles with keeping those opinions to herself. I’ve been lurking on these boards for a while, and it seems like the consensus is your spouse always comes first, and I’m having a hard time in this situation, because I think my mom is in the right.

My wife’s never liked my mom, and it’s not really because she did anything. They’re just very different people. My wife and I met in high school, and we were both huge nerds. I love that about her, but she struggles with her self-esteem. I think my wife’s gorgeous, but to most people she’s pretty average, and my mom and sister have both been in pageants and modeling, and my wife feels threatened around those types of women. I’m not projecting. She told me.

So, the real issue is my wife is an outspoken liberal feminist. I share her views, but I’m just not a confrontational guy. Over the years, she’s made a lot of comments about my mom and sister, and things she doesn’t approve of (being obssessed with appearances and name brands, joking about being trophy wives, and when we started dating my sister was heavily involved in pageants). 

The real issue started right before this social distancing, so mid-March, I think. We were at my parents’ house, and they were just joking around. My wife also can’t stand how my family jokes, but since it’s never directed at her, I feel like she should just ignore it. So, I don’t remember exactly, but my dad (M 56)  said something like go make me a sandwich woman, and my wife gave a pretty noticeable eye roll. My mom called him an ass, but at some point, she got up to make the sandwich, and dropped the plate. My dad said “you’re lucky, you’re pretty.”

Just for background they always joke like this. I have some issues with my dad, so it’s hard not to project onto the situation, but I know he loves my mom and honestly, I think it’s pretty impressive that they still joke and flirt after twenty-six years. So, my wife couldn’t take it anymore and went off about how demeaning it is to women to use terms like trophy wife, and how my mom should be embarrassed about how he talks to her, and my mom said to shut up.

Now I get that, that was rude but she followed it up, saying that she doesn’t give us her unsolicited opinions, and she doesn’t care what my wife thinks of her lifestyle. I’ve talked to my mom a little during quarantine, but with things easing up I know they’re going to invite us over at some point and my wife is still furious. I get her perspective, but ultimately, I feel like my mom has the right to tell her to mind her business, so marriage gurus, do you ALWAYS side with your spouse? 

TL;DR: My wife and mom had a fight over my dad's sexist joke, but I feel like my mom has the right to have whatever sort of marriage she wants and that my wife shouldn't give unsolicitiated opinions.",2020.0,5.0,20.0,05:45:35,victim,56

I (20F) have been dating my boyfriend (23M) since we were 13. Over the years, I have learnt that he is the most unambitious person that I know. He has a car waiting for him, but he does not have his drivers so he is not allowed to drive. He has had countless opportunities to get his drivers, but he has no interest whatsoever. He has never had any form of job or income in his life. He does not have any business contacts. He does not want to put in effort to do anything. He has been studying for 3 year diploma over the course of 5 years. He does not have any motivation or drive whatsoever. We never go on dates because he can not contribute to the date in any way. He can never take me out. My family called him a loser.

It is a huge problem for me. I am not like that and he is bringing me down so much. I am not in love with him anymore, he irritates me because he is the way he is. He loves me very much and he is very supportive and understanding, but I am so young and it feels like I am going nowhere with him. It saddens me so much because I am a very sentimental person and I can never just let go, but it feels like I have to. Have been feeling like this for a long time now. I love him and care for him, but it is so exhausting because I need to worry about him like a child. I always need to ask him if he has done his university work and I always nag about his drivers. I always have to beg him to see a doctor when he is sick as well.

I just want security and stability. I feel afraid for my future because of him, it feels like I will have to provide for the both of us. He knows how I feel and he gets angry when I confront him because he says he is ""trying"" and he is ""just focussing on finishing his diploma"" and then he makes me feel guilty for wanting him to be more ambitious. I just feel so sorry for him at the moment because he has been through a lot with his family. He is adopted and his mother emotionally abuses him.

What can I do? I feel like the only option is to leave him, it is just a matter of when and how to do it. We have been together for so long, so it will not be easy to just leave. His family is my family. I am just so scared and so incredibly sad for him and for the whole situation. We have so many good memories. He is like my best friend, but it feels like he has become my best friend and drifted away as a lover. He is still very much in love with me, but I just don't feel the same. We have grown to have different values in life.

Tl;dr - Boyfriend (23M) and I (20F) have been together for 7 years but I am thinking of leaving him because he is very unambitious and have been called a ""loser"" and I feel like I want safety and security.

In march, I was at a bar and on my way home this crazy guy tried pulling my bookbag off my back, and I sort of got in a big of a fight with him and tried holding him to the ground, but he pulled out a knight and jabbed me three times. It must have been literally the smallest knife in the world, because it didn't go deep enough to cut any organs, but I bled a bunch and looked like someone threw red paint all over me. It did shake me a bit, but I also got mugged a lot when I was younger. That was when my girlfriend kind of got shaken about this. Not about her own safety, but about like, my mental health. She was saying I should see a trauma specialist for mental health and was linking me these pages online about what to do if you have been through a traumatic incident and how it affects peoples mental health and all this stuff. I appreciated it at the time, it was sweet of her to care so much, but she kind of turned... I don't know, nasty? When she realized I wasn't entirely receptive to this stuff. It wasn't like I didn't care I got mugged, but I think she was fully expecting me to come out traumatized because SHE would come out traumatized in that same situation. But I was fine, honestly. I know its a trope to say ""im fine!"" but I didn't have some long lasting mental effect from it. 

&#x200B;

She went through this phase of thinking I am 'stuck in a shell' as she put it, and that I need to express how I really feel about the incident. It honestly frustrated me to no end, although I never showed that to her because again, I did appreciate she cared. 

&#x200B;

Then my mom died, around 4 weeks ago. I was not very close with my mom at all, she wasn't abusive or anything, but she was a drug addict and I left home to live with my then-girlfriend at 17 in brooklyn. I did not keep in contact with my mom. I have 5 siblings who were close with her, but I moved away from all of that the moment I could (just some context, I grew up in Fordham in the bronx, and moved to bay ridge in brooklyn, so I was pretty far from all that), and I never really returned to my family. So when I found out my mom died, part of me was sad, but honestly I was not THAT sad. I had not been a part of that family really since I was a teenager. And even when I was apart of the family, my mom was a drug addict who was trying to raise 6 kids, so we weren't particularly close. 

&#x200B;

So... then came another big round of sort of expecting me to be emotional, saying I should go to therapy, and being shocked and disturbed when I don't give her this sort of reaction she wants. I didn't really even know what to say. She started like, 'connecting' the two things together to try to paint this picture of me almost as some unemotional uncaring person. Its not that I don't have emotions, but these two incidents, while they might seem extreme, just didn't really get much of an emotional reaction out of me. Some part of me thinks that she wanted to 'be there for me' or something? Like she wanted me to cry on her shoulder. Because she does that with me a lot, she comes to me with her problems and I am there for her when she is feeling emotional, and I think she is a tiny bit disturbed at the idea of someone not being the same way. And I don't mean to be rude to her friends, but they are incredibly dramatic, theatrical, emotionally charged people, and I think that this sort of plays into her expectations of how people should behave emotionally. It is frustrating, im not gonna lie. This whole situation with her has been frustrating. She has been pushing really hard for me to go therapy and getting a bit mad when I don't want to. I just... hate that. It feels like I almost have to put on a show of fake emotions to her if I don't want her bugging me about this. 

&#x200B;

How do I resolve this issue? How do I get her to sort of 'back off' on this topic? Or... worse, is this a red flag? Is this bad behavior on her part or is it sort of expected?

&#x200B;

I hope this might find others who are in similar situations, as I've found support for the family/friends of people in unhealthy/abusive relationships to be lacking. It really is this worried feeling that I can never quite shake. I can respect that she has been victimized in some ways and have compassion for her, but I also think that the bystanders to relationships like this are subject to a large emotional toll. I worry about whether I will get a phone call that she is dead or in jail for harming him, and also miss my sister. It sucks. It's not about me, but it affects me.

&#x200B;

He got arrested for assault about a year ago. She said she was going to leave and I let her move into my house as a place to recuperate and get back on her feet. She lived there for about a year, didn't pay rent for a long time and then after a while, a negligible amount to help with bills. I got to see up close and personal that she has significant issues with alcohol, as well as mental health issues that she hasn't chosen to address. I sometimes think she has un-diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder.

&#x200B;

A few months ago, I went upstairs to her room to get something and he was up there, just chilling in her bed like he lived there. She lied and said it was the first time, but it turns out he had a whole drawer of clothes, and that she had been sneaking him in there for months. I asked her to move out within 30 days, as I no longer felt safe with him there. She now lives in an apartment, I presume with him, and I barely hear from her. It also turns out that she paid for his lawyer, and was likely using the \~1000 a month she was saving by living with me to fund this.

&#x200B;

This is how it's going to be. I think I'm done with trying to ""save"" her. We had a somewhat traumatic childhood and I think I'm bonded to her in an unhealthy way sometimes, trying to fix something that I have no control over. I don't really reach out to her much, aside from the occasional text telling her I am thinking of her. I am polite when I see her but I have a LOT of anger and disgust towards her that I'm trying to deal with. My hope is that one day she will leave for good and find her way back to family and friends that love her. For now she is quite isolated, although still working and paying bills. I don't know what she thinks is going to happen, neither me nor my parents want anything to do with him. I fear that she will have a child with him.

&#x200B;

Anyways, it's been my experience that if you are trying to help a person in an abusive relationship, don't sacrifice your own happiness or stress yourself out too much with it. And try not to take it personally when they don't leave, even though it feels like the most personal thing in the world. I read it takes an average of 7 times of trying to leave before someone escapes. If that's true, she has another 3-4 times of leaving before she is done. And I can't change or control a thing about it, which is what I'm working on for myself.

&#x200B;

tl;dr My sister left abusive boyfriend after assault and moved into my house to re-establish herself, heal, and save money. She then eventually decided to see him again secretly, sneaking him into my house. I had to ask her to leave. She remains with him. I've learned to set better boundaries and not over-extend myself to help someone in an unhealthy relationship, because they have to leave when they are ready to leave.",2020.0,3.0,11.0,02:51:44,victim,30

I have a great relationship with my boyfriend and we love each other dearly. We have been together for over half a year. As most couples do, we send each other nudes from time to time when we're apart and we have made three short clips whilst we have been having sex. We both consented to the making of the clips and the pictures. 

My sister borrowed my laptop last night and she has found a video I made for my boyfriend whilst we have been separated during lockdown.

There is a 1 second clip of me kissing him whilst we are having sex, which I find quite cute. 

She pulled me out of the house today to tell me how much she dislikes my boyfriend and how she thinks I'm ruining my career and reputation by sleeping with him and taking nudes and how I'm only in it for a cheap fuck. She has given me a few days to break up with him, otherwise she will be telling my parents about the video and the nudes. My parents are very conservative and I know they will shout abuse at me and possibly kick me out of my house. 

I don't know what to do. I love my boyfriend so much and we have a wonderful relationship. I don't want to end it with him, as we both see a future with one another. I know what she will pass this on to my parents and shame me for doing it. I'm scared they're going to explode on me and kick me out and cut me off.

633,24,71,Should I give my mood-swing BF (who was possibly emotionally abusive) who is now in therapy a second chance? I love him but scared it will go back to how it was.,10.0,ge3s95,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ge3s95/should_i_give_my_moodswing_bf_who_was_possibly/,42.0,1588734001.0,"Hi everyone! I apologize in advance if this is a lot of reading, but you have no idea how much I appreciate your help. I am a complete confused mess now, and really really need neutral advice.

I posted on here about three months back (it is not allowing me to link the original post.)

To give a summary of the original post (if you don't want to read it), my BF (33 M) and I (32 F) had been together for 9 months. We talked about marriage and kids and all that. We have a LOT in common and want the same things in the future. But as the nine months progressed, I saw more and more mood swings and EXTREME and strange reactions to things that are minimal (see original post for examples.) At times he would say things that are so cruel, it must be to intentionally hurt me. I wasn't sure, but think it may have been emotional abuse. I think he may have slight borderline personality disorder, also he is in AA.

Some examples to prove his reactions are not ""normal"":

\-One time he told me he didn't like my personality because I ""bothered"" him by pointing out a long line at a deli.

\-He was rude/left the restaurant the first time meeting my best friend (this was only 2 months in!) because her BF didn't come with us to dinner (he never was supposed to come, my BF just got mad for some reason 5 mins into dinner and left.)

\-Once I told him that I heard on the news it would snow later that day so he left work. It didn't snow. He got FURIOUS with me because I ""caused"" him to leave work and told me he could never trust me again.

\-He was wearing the same hat as a woman. I pointed out they had the same hat and he BLEW UP raging mad for 6 hours because I ""called him feminine.""

\-He shaved his head during quarantine and I jokingly said ""WOW! You're a different person."" I said it two separate times on facetime because he did look totally different! He thought I was insulting his appearance and didn't understand how I don't realize this is insulting. Fuming mad about this.

\-We were going to visit my sister in another city. I was really excited and he knew all the plans. One involved dinner with her friends. The night before we went he asked me ""Do you really think I want to hang out with your sister and all her little friends?""

\-He was in a horrible mood. We had gotten a gift card for a certain restaurant and went that night. The music was loud and it felt ""going-out ish."" He got in an even worse mood and wouldn't talk to me at all. I said I know this isn't your first choice place, but you're a grown up and this is date night, can't we just make the best of it? All he said was ""let's just get this over with, I hope the food comes fast"". We sat in uncomfortable silence the whole meal.

\-The other night he asked me to leave his apt at 2:30 am because he couldn't sleep. Apparently he was annoyed that my dog was sleeping in bed and that I left her water bowl in the middle of the apartment without asking him first. I was sound asleep and had to walk home through the streets of NYC at 2:30 am with my dog.

\-His brother works at a restaurant and his hours are being cut. My uncle owns a company in the same town. I asked my uncle if his company was hiring (I did not give his brother's name or anything), and if my uncle said yes, my plan was to pass the info on to my BF and then he and his brother could make a decision about whether to apply. He got FURIOUS that I asked. ""How dare I get involved with his brother or his family."" I literally was only trying to help. He could have said that was nice but no thanks. Instead he told me he's not sure he loves me anymore and doesn't know if he wants me to meet his family (we were leaving for me to meet his family for the first time the following week.) He also came into my apartment without telling me first to search for and take his keys back as a result of this.

In the original post, about 150 people answered and the VAST majority was to RUN.

So where I am now.

I broke up with him the end of January right after I posted that original post. He reached out a month later and we have been ""trying"" again the last two months. We are not officially together but trying. My issue is that things have been so perfect the last two months and now I don't know what to do (also someone smartly pointed out that in quarantine he has many fewer stresses in terms of commuting and work that would often cause the mood swings.) I think I love him, but I don't love those parts of him. And I am TERRIFIED it will go back to how it was (if it does, I'm gone.) But I also haven't seen those parts of him in two months, so maybe it's better? Or maybe he's just on his best behavior. He has been in therapy now for five months, but can therapy really change his personality? I know that we will argue, that's a given, but it can't get to the point that it was. It was horrific towards the end and I was basically always on eggshells waiting for the next explosion.

Basically, what do I do??? Please help. Most people in my life hate him for how he treated me in the past and can't get past that if I were to give him a second chance. I don't even honestly know if I want to give him a second chance, because can people really change? Also, yesterday was my birthday and I am now 32 and TERRIFIED to not be able to have a family based on my age. I almost feel like he is my last chance and the last thing I want to do is date again. I have a really hard time meeting people I click with.

PLEASE, PLEASE HELP. I cannot stop crying and I just don't know how to make the decision of whether to stop wasting time and just end it, or keep going to see if he really has changed.

Thank you SO much!!

So my older sister (27F) always urges me (25F) to visit her, but my brother in law (34M) is so creepy and has had an obvious thing for me for a while now. He’s been trying to text me for the past few days though I haven’t responded. 

He sent me a picture of him with his motorbike group out of the blue, when we never send things like that to each other. I saw that as him trying to hook me up with one of his friends as he kept mentioning it to me previously. When I said thanks although I’m going steady with someone, he said he wasn’t trying to hook me up and that *going steady means you’re bringing him over for dinner, and you actually call each other an item*. When I protested against his talking to me this way, he said he forgot how “sensitive I am” and that he just didn’t want me to think he stays at home all the time. Very weirdly needing validation and jealous. That’s just one example of his attitude towards me. I didn't respond to any of his texts after that.

Another example of my BIL hitting on me is I tried to spook him ages ago, he told me I’m “too beautiful to be scary”. He also overpraised my dinner just the other day which made me slightly uncomfortable. He’s also always trash-talked men I’ve dated previously calling them “serial killers”; he never had a good word to say about any of them. He played it off as a joke but honestly who speaks like that? How come he never trashed my brother's girlfriend?

I admit I’m maybe not totally complacent in my BIL’s advances, I used to when I was younger (very stupidly and naively) obtain relationship advice from him since I had no life experience and no male influence in my life I could speak to about these things. My sister was ok with my doing so. Although I know it’s wrong to obtain love advice from my sister’s husband now, but since I grew up sheltered and my family is a tight knit one, and we were all so close at first, I somehow thought it was ok. This was also before I discovered Reddit. 

In addition I called him drunk the other day (before he sent me all the texts) when my sister wouldn’t pick up, which wasn’t me trying to make a move, just drunkenly not thinking and wanting someone to speak to knowing he’s the only one in my family that’s ok with alcohol (my family is Muslim and doesn’t drink, I’m not, he’s a convert to Islam so used to drink). So there’s a potential for him to blackmail me about my drinking to my family which would basically cause them to disown me if they knew. I wouldn’t put it past him. And I think my sister deserves better than him. 

I know this was all wrong of me, I’m now trying to put up more serious boundaries but it’s not working and he keeps texting me. I know if I bring it up to my sister she’ll just call me crazy and say I’m in the wrong like she did last time I brought this up. I feel so uncomfortable to go over now, I don’t want to see him and just want it to all be over. What should I do? Thanks greatly for any help.

TL;DR: BIL keeps making advances on me subtly and not subtly, sister wants me to come over but I’m too uncomfortable to do so.",2020.0,6.0,4.0,03:32:35,victim,27
635,26,73,Hated by in-laws for doing favour for brother-in-law,1.0,gxevv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gxevv0/hated_by_inlaws_for_doing_favour_for_brotherinlaw/,11.0,1591425966.0,"I've known my (future) in-laws for twenty years. I've helped them out physically, emotionally and financially in the past, but recently the whole family has turned against me and my fiancé has cut them out of his life defending me.

My brother-in-law is in his late thirties, has a good career, and lives with his girlfriend in his mother's home. His girlfriend is pretty and charming. She is the type of person who would flatter you endlessly with hollow compliments, but wouldn't break a sweat to help you in a time of need. She is spoilt, demands a lot, helps out with nothing, doesn't return favours, pays for very little, speaks badly of her boyfriend's family, uses him as a free taxi service, travels around the world with other men, goes out for dinner and dancing regularly with her ex-boyfriend, and forces her boyfriend to sleep apart from her. Despite this, she often complains to her friends and his family that my brother-in-law doesn't do enough for her.

My brother-in-law and I had once been close friends. He has long been confiding in me about his relationship troubles, but he has never allowed me to speak badly of his girlfriend, and in public he still puts on oversharing displays of happiness with her. Whenever he tried to address the problems directly with his girlfriend, she gets sad, sulks, guilt-trips him, and compares him to other men.

My mother-in-law has also confided in me about her problems with his girlfriend, particularly her laziness, her non-contribution to bills, and her halting her (nominal) rent payments whenever she's off travelling with male friends. Still, my mother-in-law refuses to cause any upset or embarrassment by letting these feelings known to others.

A few weeks ago my brother-in-law broke up with his girlfriend over an unreasonable demand that impacted and upset his family. He asked me if he could stay with me and my fiancé (his brother) until she moved out, and we agreed. During this time, he revealed the true extent of the gaslighting, control and abuse he'd been tolerating in secret, though it was something we had long suspected. He asked me to speak to his girlfriend in hope that she would agree to change for a reconciliation, so I contacted her after he had returned home. I said nothing impolite, just that I was asked to speak to her and pointing out how her behaviour needs to change if she wants to make the relationship work.

She took this as an unjustified attack and went straight to my brother-in-law in anger, and he reacted in fear, denying that he had asked me to speak to her. He then went to his mother in anger, who went to my fiancé in anger. My fiancé defended me, informing his mother that I was only doing what I was asked to do, but she didn't believe it. Eventually, when she discovered this was the truth, she still insisted that I was at fault.

My brother-in-law has now reconciled with his girlfriend and blamed me for not staying out of his business. When my fiancé refused to take his side, my brother-in-law accused him of being under my control. My mother-in-law said the same and angered my fiancé more when she made the false assumption that I was forcing him to turn against his family when, in fact, I was advising against it. So, in a final attempt to make peace, I sent my brother-in-law a message asking that we brush this matter off as a faultless miscommunication to reconcile the family. Then the family blocked me on all digital communication methods and they haven't spoken to either of us since. The final message I received from the girlfriend was a string of laughing emojis.

A few weeks later and my fiancé and his family have not spoken. The lies about me manipulating my fiancé have likely spread far and wide as now his extended family also refuse to speak to me. However, since then, my relationship with him has been amazing as I never realised how exhausted I had become resolving his family's endless complaints and favour requests while upholding their public image of a perfect household. But I still can't get over this guilt I feel over my fiancé not having contact with his family, with whom he was once very close. Or the hatred that his family all now hold towards me for defending my brother-in-law at his request. What I need to know is this: Is there any way to fix this, or is letting them go the right thing to do?

TL;DR? My fiancé's brother asked me to speak to his abusive girlfriend to convince her to change. When this angered her, he denied asking me to do this. My fiancé's family have turned against me and my fiancé has cut them out of his life. Is there any way to fix this, or is letting them go the right thing to do?",2020.0,6.0,6.0,12:31:06,victim,

I didn't see most of this when we started going out 14 years ago. A friend pointed out some out she's got lots of problems herself and wonders why I stick around.

-She gets down on herself a lot. Self esteem issues. Never believes me when I say I find her attractive. At one point she said it was only because she's the only girl I've ever been with. Friend says she just wants more compliments to boost her ego. 

-She's real weird about chores. Doesn't let me do the laundry because she has a ""system"", which often involves folding and organizing clothes by type and COLOR, down to underwear and socks. I'm a dude, so I don't care much about order. But she insists it has to be done a certain way. I don't mind not doing laundry but my friend says her ""OCD"" is really just about control. She has a similar thing with dishes. 

-She's asked me not to curse and yell at my video games (it's a form of stress relief for me, I don't do this in the real world). Said she can't handle yelling even if it's not directed at her because it reminds her of her abusive parents, specifically her stepdad. She herself has voiced doubts it's PTSD, even though that's what her therapist calls it since it makes her anxious through emotional flashbacks.

-But it's like that rule only applies to me. When I'm frustrated with anything, my voice raises (never at her), but she always says to chill out and stop complaining. She does the same type of thing though (getting frustrated/irritated in general at everyday things) and complains a lot. Isn't this a bit hypocritical?

-She cut off her parents recently. I thought that was a bit dramatic, but she insists this was the right thing and that everyone else supports her. I know they were abusive and toxic, but even she concedes most of it was a long time ago when she was under 18. Her stepdad was physically and mentally abusive; her mother was emotionally abusive. Her little brother still lives with them; it doesn't seem fair she's lost that connection because it's not his fault. She insists she will never reach out to them no matter what.

-As much as she hates her mother's qualities, she's growing more like her everyday. She can get short and irritable over small things. On other days, she can be really nice. There was a bipolar aunt in the family--maybe this is something she has? She can be lazy like her mom, wanting to chill on the couch playing video games while I cook or mow the lawn. Don't get me wrong, she doesn't some chores too but only when she feels like it. She blames some of it on depression (she's medicated and goes to therapy) and is pretty open about it. My friend wondered at what point do we draw the line and stop ""using depression as an excuse""? Anytime she gets called out on her behavior she gets real emotional. 

-When we married, we said we'll have kids but she's changed her mind. She said she'd rather adopt than put her body through that. I know she's had a lot of problems with her uterus - endometriosis, pelvic congestion syndrome, etc - but she's had some of that surgically taken care of. My brother isn't having kids and there's been some pressure from our parents to have kids. My mom said we owed it to the world to have ""smart kids"" (since she and I are both engineers). My wife disagrees, saying she wouldn't want to bestow any of her medical problems, especially the mental ones, down to a child. She's most afraid of post partum depression, which her mom had severely. 

-She has had a bit of a shopping problem. Even she admits she has too many clothes and jewelry, but every week there seems to be another package delivered with stuff like that for her. Once in a while she'll surprise me with something like a tshirt but that's about it. 

-She's a hypocrite about eating out too. It didn't seem so bad but she's made a budget spreadsheet. She was concerned on how much we ate out -- between groceries and eating out we spent $700-800/month. (Thank God for quarantine because that number dropped for now.) But at the same time since she doesn't like to cook, take out is the first thing she suggests. Pre quarantine, she would even eat out during the work week despite having brought lunch with her, and then fusses at me when I eat out with my coworkers. (She doesn't eat with her coworkers, just eats at her desk solo.)

Other small examples of her being controlling: 

-she knows passwords to everything but doesn't have them written for me. I have to ask every time because I forget. She pays and takes care of the bills and budgeting. 

-She has a ""schedule"" for most days, including what chores or fun stuff she wants to do and lives by that list. If she wants to play video games, well then I guess that's what we are going to do. If it's chores then a movie...you get the idea

-She says I talk an awful lot to my female coworker. Says it's not a jealousy thing but she never stays in touch or has to talk to her coworkers that much. (It's been more obvious since we worked at home during quarantine.) i get a lot of phone calls a day because of the nature of my work. 

-She kinda controls my music. She has a respectively large collection and has loaded my music player with the stuff she listens too, curtailing genres I don't care for. Every so often, she'll ""update"" it for me with new music. 

These all seem like petty things but again, since they were raised concerns, I thought I could bring them here.

Tl;dr - Wife displays narcissistic and controlling attributes, says she's just depressed and OCD. What do I do?

Moved together after we both found jobs last year. The year before moving together she started having some family problems, like her mum developing Alzheimer extremely fast, or and her dad being unable to control his feelings about this and being verbally abusive to her whenever something upsets him. She was torn down and I thought getting her out of that toxic environment would help her. It didn't.

Now she feels guilty of abandoning her family. Her psychiatrist helped her understand that she can't give up on her life to nurse her parents, but she still feels bad about it constantly. The lockdown has affected her heavily too. While I have to work from home and keep myself happily busy, she spends the day watching TV mostly and then feels bad about not being productive. I try to cheer her up and propose spending time together in hobbies, chores, etc, but it's so hard to get her to do anything. 

This morning I woke up 4h earlier than her (she is sleeping about 10-12h a day and it's really hard to get her out of bed, so now I just leave her to wake up when she feels like). I started doing chores and after she had breakfast and went back to bed I encouraged her to help me out so she'd feel more proactive and positive. She broke down crying because she found it too hard to start doing anything, so I happily offered to take care of everything if she preferred to stay in bed or do sth more fun. I have the time and REALLY don't mind. She said no because that'd make her feel useless and irresponsible. 

Today she also told me I'm the only positive, happy person she knows. Truth be told, I really try to speak in a happy encouraging way when I talk to her, but living with a person who is depressed all day is taking a heavy, heavy toll on me. I go to sleep feeling like shit, each time she cries I am counting the minutes for it to be over, and recently I've even started to feel attracted to other girls, which in four years of our relationship hadn't happened and is making me feel guilty af. 

Now I know that I still want to spend the rest of my life with her and she doesn't WANT to feel like this. I want her to be happy again, like she was when we started dating. I want to have eyes only for her. Being such a perfect match in everything else just makes this more frustrating. She's such a kind, loving, caring, intelligent and gorgeous person... She deserves to be happy, and I have realized that her happines is not within my hands. If anyone advises leaving her, it's important to note that probably I'm the only one cheering and supporting her everyday. I think she deserves that, and breaking up would break me too. 

I don't know what to do or where to go from here.
Any advice on dealing with this situation or my own feelings is very welcome.

It’s caused a lot of near misses to the face since we’ve lived here. 

The other day I was taking a shower and I had forgotten to close the bathroom cabinet door. 

My girlfriend Molly came in while I was in the shower to use the toilet. When she walked in she hit her face smack by her eye on the corner of the cabinet. 

I was immediately apologetic for leaving it open and we told both could tell that it was gonna leave marks on her face. 

Well Molly is an assistant grocery store manager for a small local store and has been working crazy shifts lately with everything thing going on.

When she went into work the day after she hit her head, her coworkers starting expressing their “concern” to Molly. They asked her how things were at home and if everything was okay with me and her. 

She told them that everything was fine and that she had just hit her head on the bathroom cabinet. She said that it was obvious nobody believed her. The next day, they blatantly asked her whether I had put my hands on her. She said that in no way had I done that and she explained the cabinet story again. She said that they still didn’t believe her because it seems like such a stereotypical coverup story and they assumed she was just covering for me. 

She FaceTimed her family the other day and they immediately asked her about her face. She essentially went through the exact same story she told her coworkers. I didn’t intervene as I didn’t want to make it seem like it was really my fault. 

I should probably make it clear that I did prison time (not for anything violent) and that her family has never liked me because of this. 

I got a text from her brother yesterday saying that if I’m putting my hands on Molly that he was going to “fuck me up.” I just didn’t answer because I didn’t want to aggravate him. 

I feel like I’m doomed here. No matter what Molly says, they don’t believe either of us and I also feel like my history is working against me. 

I don’t know how to move forward. Is my reputation just forever ruined for something I didn’t do? No matter what Molly says they think she’s just covering for me and they obviously won’t believe me no matter what I say. 

What do I do?

I've always gotten on with his family, especially his mum (this is relevant and I'll explain why shortly.) Me and her were quite close, we'd chat a lot at their house (he lives with his parents and his sister), and message about things we thought the other would like. She's a lovely person. I spent quite a bit of time at their house and got to know them well.

Towards the end of last year, me and my bf had a rocky patch. He was very difficult to be around, bad tempered, argumentative, and nothing I said was good enough. He was the same with his family. Shortly after this, he attempted to take his own life. At the hospital, he told me he didn't want me to tell his mother. Although I wanted to, I respected his wishes because of his state of mind, and also because of how he'd been, I didn't want to make him angry.

Eventually he talked to his sister and asked her to tell his mum. It was a fraught time, eventually I left him because of his behaviour towards me, as I found out he was talking to other women behind my back.

Anyway...

We eventually got back together. Things were pretty intense and sensitive, and I found out he'd told his family that while we were together previously, I'd done some emotionally abusive things. I had done the actions he spoke of, but NOT in an emotionally abusive context. For example, I shouted at him when I found out that he'd been soliciting sexual pics from a female friend. I'd had suspicious and he'd assured me that I had nothing to worry about, and I'd believed him. I shouted at him because I was angry and upset. There was also an incident where he'd done something similar and we were trying to talk through it, and he cancelled plans with his family to stay with me. I in no way asked him or expected him to do this, nor was I aware he thought I'd manipulated the situation to get him to stay with me until months after.

So his family have said I am definitely emotionally abusive. His mum then banned me from their house because she was upset I hadn't told her about bf being in hospital months earlier.

He has since apologised for thinking I was manipulative. He does rightly say he cannot control his mum's decisions as it is her house, but the really odd thing I have only recently realised is that HE is upset at ME because I did what he asked by not telling his mum he was in hospital, and it's upset his mum. In his eyes, I have done wrong by upsetting his mum by doing exactly what HE asked me to do. He actually got mad at me about it and I was so taken aback, I haven't properly addressed it with him.

How should I approach this with him? I feel really resentful that I'm the bad guy in this to him. I totally understand his mum feeling upset and that she's entitled to allow or not allow me in the house, but he is treating me like I'm serving out a sentence until she decides I can come in the house again, and to be honest I'm not entirely sure I want to set foot in a house full of people who clearly think I'm abusive when I'm not! 

tl;dr My boyfriend is mad at me because he asked me to not tell his mum he was in hospital after a suicide attempt, and it upset his mum that I didn't tell her. I want to know how to handle this situation.

Update:
Thankyou everyone for the input.

I know this sounds clueless, but it's only the last 3 or 4 weeks I've actually been like, hang on, this is actually really insane. 

I spoke to my bf about this, as mentioned. His account is slightly different than he or his mum originally said - I think the reasons have evolved as the weeks have passed.

After I addressed this with my bf, he went to his mum to discuss it. She said that she'd said some things she regretted and wants to move forward. They are saying now that I was banned because me and bf were arguing so much and it was making him unhappy. Then as COVID emerged, obviously I wouldn't have been able to go there anyway. Then it's because his sister who doesn't live there is heavily pregnant, and as their family events are BBQs outside, I can't go if she's there as it's too risky. Even though all of them in the house have been out to go to the shops, etc, and they're social distancing, for some reason I am more of a risk than anyone else.

I have told my bf I am really disappointed in his attitude throughout this; yes, he cannot control other people's opinions or actions, but by carrying on as normal, but excluding me, he's sent a very clear message where his priorities lie.

At this moment, I'm contemplating my situation. I have no interest whatsoever in going in his house or having anything to do with his family. I feel very hurt by my bf and his mum, and tbh I'm hoping that at some point he's going to come to me and say, 'look, actually I've had some time to think and yes, it was a really fucking shitty thing of me to do, to just cast you aside because you weren't allowed in the house. I see it now. ' Will I get that? I very much doubt it.",2020.0,6.0,1.0,06:40:10,victim,
641,32,88,Religion is making me consider divorcing my wife.,104.0,gj92tc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gj92tc/religion_is_making_me_consider_divorcing_my_wife/,72.0,1589436785.0,"In early 2020, my wife (35) began to adopt a certain religion and was including our child (9) into their studies. At first, I (39) respected it and even encouraged it, but then she began steeping her further into it at times not limited to the meetings and our daughter began saying things that were alarming, once, among others, telling me that all other religions were ""false"". I began overhearing lyrics to the hymns they would sing at the meetings that I found highly objectionable, engendering fear and obedience to happy, jovial tunes. Then I started to listen to what was being said in the study groups and meetings and was horrified. Cognitive dissonance, a distrust of education, and anti-science sentiment abound. But, the breaking point which made me finally speak out was when one morning my wife said to me as casually as ordering a steak at a restaurant that our daughter no longer wants to celebrate holidays and was afraid to come to me about it. This is a religion, you see, that does not believe in celebrating holidays, and I was being asked to accept that a third-grader made this decision on their own. According to my wife, she provided her with the tools to research why this religion considers them wrong (because a devil created them to distract us from the creator) and she now wants nothing to do with them or the past decade of memories and joy and family gathering we cherished and memorialized because they now feel guilty if they do.


My wife has since expressed a half-hearted attempt to compromise when it comes to certain holidays and while this did alleviate my pain, I feel like a change has occured that I cant ignore. The idea of the joyous celebration of family that comes with birthdays and Christmas being something that is endured because of my insistence taints them to such a degree I no longer feel inspired to do it. I feel like something sacred has been taken away from me with all the callous consideration of a teenager stealing a pack of gum from a 7-11. Something has been done and now cannot be undone with a simple walk-back. But besides my own selfish pain, I fear the lasting effects of teaching the strict dogma of this particular religion to my young, impressionable child. To teach this limitless, pure mind fear, doom, prejudice, and bigotry no matter how it's disguised I feel borders on child abuse. And its happening to my child under my roof. I've expressed my concerns to her in no uncertain terms: that while this has begun as something our daughter enjoys, that the only real reason she does enjoy it is because it is something she can do together with her mom and they get to sing. These are lessons in thought control that has begun relatively harmless, but WILL evolve into further demands of on her psyche and there are already hints of it. Am I going too far for considering leaving my wife over this? Would would you do in this situation?  And have any of you been in a similar one? I had a lot more to share, but the text limits prevented the more intimate details. Please ask if anything seems unclear.


TL;DR My wife is unknowingly indoctrinated our daughter into a religious dogma I find horrific and am considering divorce.",2020.0,5.0,14.0,11:58:05,victim,35

I was extremely neglected and abused as a child and it has caused me to have a whole range of issues when it comes to relationships with others in any aspect. I've been in therapy for a long time and I feel like I'm in a good place mentally to be in a relationship with someone, but I just don't know how to even begin to explain the layers of dysfunction to someone else.

The family members who I am still in contact with are extremely dysfunctional and I am always just telling him that it isn't the right time to meet them, which I know upsets him, especially when I have already met and bonded with his family. As embarrassing as this is to admit I'm really ashamed of my family and my upbringing and I have always felt like no one can truly understand what I went through, even though I know logically this isn't true. But my boyfriend comes from an upper middle class, two parent house hold and is very close with his own family and I don't want him to view me differently, due to the contrast of our pasts.

He definitely knows that my family isn't great, I've told him that I'm not close with any of my family and don't like to see them, but I've never come close to telling him the full magnitude of the problem. It's causing a bit of a strain on our relationship, became he's told me that he feels like I don't fully trust him. Which is true I don't have a strong trust in anyone, but myself. I don't want my own inability to open up to him to be cause of a breakup, but I don't know how to even approach him about it.

Obviously trust is very important in relationship, but I'm worried that if I were to tell him about my abuse, my family dysfunction and that I don't know if I will ever to fully move past it he won't want to be with me anymore. I would understand him if he did want to end things, because it's a lot to have to navigate someone else's trauma, but I really don't want that to happen.

Anyway if you guys have any suggestions on how I can bring up the conversation with him in a way that won't come off in an ambush or any advice on how to deal with this general please let me know.

643,34,90,I’m [24F] beginning to think I don’t even really like my friends as people. Where do I do from here?,57.0,gvr3xy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gvr3xy/im_24f_beginning_to_think_i_dont_even_really_like/,18.0,1591207138.0,"**Tl;dr** I think I don’t really like my friends as people, but we’ve been friends for a long time. What do I do, and how do I do it? Do I reattach myself to my current friends, or do I find new ones? How?

I [24F] have a small friend group [20sMF]. I met most of them through college, and I am the youngest by over a year. I grew very close to them in college, because I had no one and moved to this country alone at 17, to get away from my abusive home situation, and to escape violent homophobia in my home country. They were all LGBT and had suffered some degree of abuse, so we felt a connection that I desperately needed in those times.

However, almost eight years later, it’s occurred to me that I don’t really like them very much as people. I do not feel we share many values or priorities, or hobbies. We really only share some political views and interests. I actually have found myself looking down on some of my friends for their behavior and their hobbies, which I find creepy, or weird, or just a direction in life I find incompatible with my own. (for example, I have been in therapy and am currently on the waiting list to go again. I am working a full time job and making career moves. I have financial goals, long and short term. My friends are either still in college, nearing their 10th year in a 4 year program, I am the only one who’s gone to therapy even though they all need it and admitted to it, don’t have full-time jobs and not because they cannot get one, are financially irresponsible)

I find myself going through the motions – encouraging them when they’re down, supporting them if shit’s hit the fan, helping them move, communicating happiness at good things – but there is no feeling behind it and I am becoming more and more frustrated with them. I think resentment may be building. This is why I do not think I like them very much anymore, if at all.

I have no real other friends, except my brother (who is older than I and escaped our family over a decade before I did). My colleagues are all 50+, two of them retiring this year, as I got very lucky and managed to take some career steps that are unusual for my age. They’re wonderful people and I enjoy working with them, but to name those relationships “friendships” would be pushing it.

I don’t really know where to go from there. What’s wrong with me? How do I fix this? If I move on, how do I extract myself from a group like this? Where could I even make new friends, especially during corona, since I’m quite isolated? Do I wait for therapy and discuss it there? That might be months from now, especially with corona. I cannot afford a private therapist, and anything covered by insurance will have these waiting times.

Has anyone ever been in my position? How do I reattach myself to my friends?",2020.0,6.0,3.0,23:43:58,victim,24

He was preyed on by a pedophile (age 40s) since he was 16 years old. I did not know about it until this week because his mom had kept it a secret for the past 1-2 years that they were talking online. Not only were they talking but he had flown to visit him, even on a class field trip to Europe (A HIGHSCHOOL FIELD TRIP) to meet up and force my sister into having sex. I don't know everything because it has all been a secret from me for awhile now. I just know that he has blocked me on social media, I've never met him, he has convinced my sister that family is bad and not understanding and that only he can be trusted. So she has been socially withdrawn recently, and he has taken that opportunity to buy him a plane ticket to come visit him in New York City where he lives.

I am even more livid than I was when I found out days ago. My sister left this morning without anyone knowing. He and his husband (yes you heard right, he's not even single) have ignored me and my family and have practically groomed and convinced a child to come to their apartment and live. He told me he would come back, but I have reason to believe that he will tell him to stay. I know my sister is an adult (18) now, but that doesn't make any of this right..

Other than him being an obvious description of a pedophile, I have talked to past victims of his that have confirmed this. He is apparently very good at what he does, and that it is definitely not his first time. His ""husband"" was manipulated when he was 17, which was \~8 years ago. He is still under his control and is completely dependent on him. His other victims that have broken free say that he is dangerous. Maybe not physically, but emotionally. They say he will make my sister 100% dependent on him so that he cannot leave. They have told me that my sister will not be on the flight home and that it is a 1 way ticket to NY. He will force him to stay. They have told me that he does not ask for consent for sex - he simply takes and does what and when he wants.

I talked to my sister for hours when I found out. I have always been on his side, and we have never had beef. But it has been over a year of him being manipulated and convinced. It was like I was talking to a different person entirely. Withdrawn, quiet, combative, and completely oblivious and disrespectful to his entire family who has asked him not to go and to think about it, even though he is 18 now.

My sister's mom has gone to the police, but there is nothing ""illegal"" because the legal age is apparently 16 in our state. I am out of things to say or do. I am worried about my sister's safety, and I know nothing of these people other than what other survivors have told me. They have blocked me and pushed my sister away from the family.

Does anyone have any advice on what to do about a relationship between a 18 yo and 40 yo that started much younger?

**tl;dr** My 18 yo sister moved away to live with a 40 yo man who has 'groomed' her for 1-2 years, convincing my sister to shut out all family. He is a known abuser (not physically), but my sister only believes what he says.",2020.0,5.0,30.0,08:58:25,victim,40
645,36,98,Space X has launched my [27F] GF [26F] into deep self doubt and regret,91.0,gvbk2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gvbk2f/space_x_has_launched_my_27f_gf_26f_into_deep_self/,21.0,1591147468.0,"Sorry about that title... I saw an opportunity and couldn't resist. But the actual matter is quite sad.

As many people we watched the recent Space X launch together on livestream. I know that my GF had a phase of wanting to work for Nasa for a while as a kid and an avid interest in space in general, but to my knowledge she hasn't really been invested in that as an adult apart from getting excited over space news sometimes. Anyway, we were both excited and cheerful, but a few minutes after the launch I could tell her mood begin to change and she seemed to get quite upset actually. As always she tried to hide it but I can tell. So as we were about to go to bed I asked her what's up, and she said 'nothing' at first but then suddenly burst into tears and cried inconsolably for about 30 minutes. It was like a floodgate burst and I didn't really know what to do because this was the first time I've really seen her display such intense emotion.

You must know, my GF did not have a very happy childhood emotionally. I learned early when we started dating that her only remaining family member is her mother who she hasn't talked to in years because she was very abusive to her. Apparently she was consistently emotionally abused all throughout her youth and sometimes physically too, and her father died early. From the few direct quotes and such that she gave me of her mother, I was appalled someone could treat their child like that. All this time however my GF seemed to be fairly 'over' it (I understand that of course you can't be 100% over something like this, but she had been to therapy for some years and seemed very calm and factual when she told me these things). But now as she was crying she said it had upset her to see this launch and how everyone was cheering because it reminded her of how she wanted to work in this field as a kid and it didn't go anywhere because her parents laughed about it and always made her feel so stupid and incapable that she just assumed right away she wouldn't be able to do it. And that maybe if she had pursued it she could have been there now, or at least achieved 'something that really matters'. And all throughout explaining that she constantly apologized for 'being so dumb about this'. 

I tried to console her as much as I could but I don't feel like it really did anything although she calmed down and tried to laugh about it eventually. And since then she has seemed pretty down although she again tries not to show it.

I don't think this is actually about her regretting that she isn't an astronaut now. Mainly because my GF hates both Maths and Physics which as I understand it would be absolutely essential for such a  job. I think this has triggered her insecurity about herself for some reason. It's not the first time that she feels insignificant or like she  should have achieved more. She actually works as a video game developer now and is usually very happy with that, and to me that is impressive enough. She is also in general quite talented at many creative things, a GREAT singer etc who has already appeared on multiple songs (released under labels) etc. but she always thinks she has to do more and that everything she has achieved doesn't count for anything. When she achieves something she is slightly happy about it for like 5 minutes and then is already back 'down' and very factual about it and why it wasn't actually that huge. It makes me so sad because also I feel like nothing anyone says convinces her in any way. I also don't want to talk down to her or invalidate her feelings by accident. I am not very good at consoling people so I often don't know what to say really or phrase my thoughts awkwardly.

So uh.. any advice for something I could say that might cheer her up?

TL;DR my dad died and I'm scared my family won't get along 


I'm sorry if I begin ramble typing this is like one of my first posts on any sub reddit and I am just overwhelmed. So yesterday after my dad comes home he eats what my mom made for him. Eggs and spam. 

To be clear, he has a pre existing medical history of high blood pressure and gout. First found out when he was admitted to the hospital in 2015 when he fell ill and we basically had to force him to go to the hospital bc he didn't wanna go. He was put on medication since, with changes to them maybe a year or so ago.

So back to when after he ate. My half sister heard a thud around 740 ish and told me to check bc she thought maybe my parents are arguing. I go down and see my dad on the kitchen floor w my mom behind him a few feet away and I hear him snoring. I ask my mom a question get worried run back upstairs and knock on my sisters door. She calls my other sister and also tells me to stop wasting time call 911. I was scared and frantic I wish I called 911 or saw him when he came in so I could maybe have called sooner...

They get frantic too and we all start yelling at each other and I try to maintain order also as I'm talking to 911 person. At some point in all of this my brother in law yells for help and I help him turn my dad onto his side bc he said he could choke on his saliva. My dad stops snoring and we start panicking. The ems tells us how to perform cpr but my sisters keep yelling and so I try to get them working together. They finally start working on it one is doing compression and the other giving him air and sometimes rotating. Fire dept and ambulance gets here and they start doing the same thing but also have defibrillators and honestly I'm just in shock still. It was maybe 8:03pm when they came or so i dont remember it's all a blur I checked my phone for time stamp but I called twice so I forgot when original call was placed. 

They called it at 8:50pm and I just begin to lose it. My aunt comes and my sister is trying to call my dads work to let his bosses know...

We talk about how we want my dads arrangements and agree on cremation bc we dont have the money for anything else but also my sister wants the remains. 

Honestly. I wrote this post bc I'm scared for the future. My mom is bipolar schizophrenic and my sisters and bro in law dont get along w her because of a whole history that would keep you here forever if I tried to type it. My dad was a big shit talker but he still chose us and tried his best to provide regardless of his fallacies. He had my mom's back too saying he wouldn't kick her out or place her in a mental home.

My sisters kinda want that (I think) but I'm scared to talk about it. My mom is ok sometimes but also acts up bc of her mental illness sometimes and my dad and I were her constants regardless of what happened. My mom is old and still wants to benefit from some social security services that my dad had but my sisters (and i) think we should get a majority control of his account bc theres a lot of renovations to be done bc he ignored upkeep of the house for a number of years (example, the roof) my mom is not very sad about the ordeal bc she had a long history of mental abuse from my dad and I understand but we for some reason stayed together. Idk how to move forward except for one moment at a time and I'm still waiting for funeral home to come pick up his body (its 8:13 am now, been waiting since night before) and I have been crying but also I can't sleep and I'm sorry if this doesn't meet guidelines I just need to vent even tho I told a few friends I'm still in disbelief. I'm sorry to write so much I just can't help it. Idk how this will work moving forward. I believe it can though. But it's hard to stay positive",2020.0,4.0,6.0,02:07:47,victim,03

Anyway, I (18F) am nearing the last few weeks of my first year of college. I’ve been in a relationship with my boyfriend (18M) for almost 2 years, and we’re still going strong. I know that these couple years of school are hard on pre-existing relationships because you meet new people and learn a lot about yourself. I guess I just want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience as what I will mention, or if anyone just has advice or thoughts in general. 

I lived in a dorm at my university this year and my boyfriend lived at home while going to his university, but we were still close by. I never partied in high school, mainly because I didn’t like the people in my school, but now I’m with my roommates who I love and we go out a lot and have tons of fun. 

Something new that’s come up is that my boyfriend gets super bad panic attacks whenever we go out. He’s had a lot of traumatic experiences involving his family and drug and alcohol abuse in the past, so I understand. We talked about it a lot and I asked how I could help him, and he wanted me to not go out as much. And, when I do go out he wanted me to keep him updated pretty regularly. I know he wants me to have fun and he hates that he feels this way but that’s how it is.

I’ve told him he needs to get professional therapy because as much as I want to help him and support him, I am not qualified. I always listen and try my best, but where do I draw the line between being part of the relationship and helping him versus being my own person and doing what I want? He also said it would help if he could come when we go out, but I know he doesn’t like going out and just wants to be with me.

All of my roommates are single and none of them have ever been in a relationship so they don’t understand. I love having girls nights and being with them though. And I always make sure that if I go out with them one night, I’ll be with him the next. 

I don’t want to say screw it and just leave him when the attacks happen, but I also don’t want to give up going out. 


Am I doing the right thing or should I be more assertive? 

TL;DR My boyfriend gets severe panic attacks when I go out with friends, and wants me to go out less. I know he doesn’t want to limit me and I don’t want to miss out, but I feel like I can’t just leave him to deal with attacks alone.",2020.0,4.0,14.0,15:37:42,victim,18
648,39,102,Just found out my (37f) boyfriend (35m) has been frequently hanging out with his secret/mentally ill ex-wife (33F) behind my back the whole time we’ve been dating and lying about it.

Apologies if this is all over the place, my head is a mess and I am *completely* gutted.

After months, nay, YEARS of going on disappointing and borderline disastrous dates, (I use OLD sites, live in a fairly large New England City, dating here is really tough for some reason), I finally met a guy who I really clicked with.

Our first date was the honestly the best date I had ever been on, the chemistry was ebullient and I walked home from the pub feeling like my $39 TJ Maxx heels were filled with some sort of sidewalk skimming helium. To my luck, that infatuated feeling was mutual and we have been almost inseparable ever since. We became close very quickly and it developed into him staying with me a few nights out of the week. I enjoyed his company and didn’t feel overwhelmed, this was significant step for me because I am a serial introvert/loner who needs great amounts of time alone to be happy and functioning.

We fell in love quickly and became very close. We established within a week of seeing each other that we both wanted to be in an exclusive relationship with each other.

Two months in, he tells me he loves me, and that the past 2 months have been the best of his life and he wants to spend the rest of his life with me. Of course I’m elated because I feel the same and truly felt he was everything I wanted. All of it. Incredible chemistry sexually and intellectually. I thought “this was it”. No more dating apps! We’re in it for the long haul! This is awesome! I was on Cloud nine.

Then Quarantine happens. Not to rub it in people faces… but being stuck together at my apartment created a a fast-tracked version of a bout of blissful intimacy. I live alone, so he would come over just about every other day. We filled the time with so many fun things- we baked weird stuff, played Trivial Pursuit, made fun dinners, built a bird feeder, went on hikes, binged TV shows. Stay up all night listening to music and laughing, sometimes having sex 4 times a day…3 times in one night… we couldn’t get enough of each other. We would just lay in bed and stare into each others eyes. It was like something out of a movie. We both have 9-5 corporate jobs, so we would work from home together as well. It was hilariously fun.

As I got to know him in this intimate and accelerated courting situation, he presented to me a stable, loving, honest, intelligent and loyal man with strong values that aligned with mine.

As all couples do, we shared our past relationship baggage/history. So out it comes….He had just broken up with his “girlfriend” (this is what he called her) of five years the previous summer. So he had been single for just a few months before meeting me. He said they were two different people who weren’t compatible and had no right being with each other. He said that she suffered from severe mental illness and depended on him emotionally and financially and despite being an adult woman, couldn’t support herself in any way. They met in a PHD program while in London (he’s British, she’s American) and said she was on a myriad of prescription medication and exhibited self-harming behavior.. He described it as a toxic relationship, devoid of sex and intimacy. They both moved to Boston a few years ago together and that after the break up, he said he no longer had contact with her and she lived upstate on a farm with her family and a dog they had bought together like a month before they broke up. (they bought the dog together, not the farm)

It sounded messy but hey, it’s in the past. Everything is great. We’re together, life goes on. I think nothing of it, or her.

Fast forward a few weeks later, he comes over to my house and as I’m cooking dinner for us, he flippantly mentions that he just got back from the farm where he had been hanging out with his ex-girlfriend and dog all day. Like so casually, as if he had just said “yeah I had a 6-inch footlong tuna at Subway for lunch”. I was floored, started shaking and just couldn’t believe what I had just heard. I was confused and felt threatened and insecure.

Apparently he had driven 2 hours up to the farm where she works and claims to have “barely even exchanged 5 sentences with her” and “he just went to see his dog”. So of course I get quiet. I don’t even know what to say. He asks what’s wrong, like as in he has no idea how I could possibly be bothered by this. I explain to him that I feel that seeing her is inappropriate and I feel threatened by it. He seems surprised and says it was no big deal and he will continue to do it because he loves and misses his dog. No reassurance at all, no apology… nothing. We eat dinner in silence and I finally tell him I feel like I am second in priority to a fucking DOG and he isn’t taking my feelings into consideration.

I ask him to leave. He does.

He contacts me the following day and tells me that after after thinking about it, he realizes that since it bothers me, he won’t ever see her or the dog again. I felt like I had possibly come off as slightly controlling but I believed I wasn’t being unreasonable. I had been cheated on by a boyfriend in the past (his respective ex was the other woman) so this issue was a huge point of pain for me and knew this.

So then things go back to normal.. or so I thought.

This past Friday, while on the couch snuggling together, I see a text message notification pop up from the ex girlfriend. He slides it away and flips his phone over. He then spends the rest of the night faced away from me texting and giggling with a sly smile. I was gutted and knew something was up. After I had just cooked him homemade manicotti. THE BASTARD.

We go to bed and my mind is racing. I can’t sleep. I know this is emotionally immature and an invasion of his privacy, but after he fell asleep I took his phone into my living room to look through the messages. I find what was my worst fear, he had been carrying on with her continuously without pause. I’m not sure if they ever even broke up. The messages went back even before we had met and the latest was just a few minutes before he fell asleep in MY BED with the mother fucking wine I BOUGHT in his stupid stomach. Good for her. There were many messages, hell, they even texted each other more than he and I did. He would send us both the same memes and funny twitter posts. To her credit, her responses were funnier than mine. Good for her.

As I went through the messages I discovered they saw each other almost every other day (I am actually shocked at how he juggled his time so well between us). All of the messages coordinating hangouts was him pursuing her and asking her to hang out. Telling her she is cute. Saying I miss you. Driving two hours to help her move or work on their farm. She even cooked him a birthday dinner. He told me he was with his mates that’s night. Stupidly, I spent the whole night painting him something beautiful and making a ten hour braised Osso Bucco for him while he’s over at her house eating fried vegetables with staring at her dead-eyed troll looking ass.

So I stayed up all night and even recorded the messages on my phone for evidence so he couldn’t try to deny anything. I popped a Xanax so I could stay calm and not break my remote control over his stupid head when he woke up. He finally woke up at six am, I told him to sit down and told him what I saw.

The blood drained from his head and he started to string along a myriad of explanations… that they were “just friends” and that he feels indebted to her because she is suicidal, mentally unstable and not self-sufficient. He claims that she has no one else to talk to, has no friends and her family is pure abusive trash (even though she lives with them and they all run a non-profit farm that helps low income people eat healthy foods, what monsters they must be!)

He feels like he has to take care of her because she is such a mess and a danger to herself yet this woman is a professor at a large university and is head of a farm, so I don’t know how much of a mess she could possibly be. It all sounded like a bunch of bull, but was entertaining watching him attempt to deny and lie what I had just seen in plain black and white text. I then ask him if they were married, because a text message had referenced a $2400 stimulus check and he said NO, they were just engaged. I asked him if they were still together, he said no. The cherry on top was that at no point did he apologize.

He claimed that they barely talked and hardly ever saw each other, which was so brazen considering he knew what I had just seen. He said that he can’t stand when she opens her mouth and just complains all of the time. He also said that his therapist has been urging him to break communication off with her because she is toxic. Not sure if this is true. The most hurtful part of all of this is is that the day after he swore he would never see her again, he texted her asking if he could come see her and then drove up to her place to hang out.

After about 15 minutes of talking, I couldn’t deal with any more of his crappy attempts at explaining so I just asked him to leave.

The next day he called me and admitted to me that they were in fact married, still married and they got married in England so she could stay in the country. Is this even a thing? I asked him if they were intimate since we had been together and he said no.

He keeps calling me to talk but I deny his calls. I was in love with this person, deeply. The idea of never seeing him again makes me so so so sad, yet I don’t know how this emotion can possibly exist inside me considering how much pain he’s caused me by lying, repeatedly. Should I at least hear him out even if we don’t reconcile? And if we do decide to somehow make it work, how does one even operate successfully as a couple after such breach of trust? He lied multiple times and he is swearing that this is an isolated incident and doesn’t reflect who he is as a person and his core values. My self esteem is pretty low right now and I feel like someone stuck a Taco Bell spork into my chest cavity.

TLDR- My (ex, I guess) boyfriend had been hanging out with his ex-wife while we were dating who he claimed to never be married to and is trying to reconcile with me. Where do we go now?

# UPDATE HERE-

I ask, While reading this update, please try to find a tender spot in yourself to recognize that that I am only human, I was once deeply in love with this person and my self-esteem has been spun to the viscosity of cotton candy. You may be disappointed with me throughout this post, but you will be proud of me in the end, I promise. I’m like the Tonya Harding of toxic relationships. Or maybe actually the opposite. I dunno, I need to lay off the gin and tonics for tonight perhaps. 

Also, thank you to all of the people who wrote truly kind-hearted and well thought out responses and suggestions to this bizarre and painful experience, it was immensely helpful to my mental state. I also apologize for the long-windedness of this but I find that writing is great therapy for me and typing this all out helps me organize my thoughts and bring closure to the situation.

Where I left off, I will pick back up. After the whole debacle, I was tempted to block his number but I kind of just craved those oh so satisfying and cringey “begging for forgiveness” texts. But to my surprise. They… never came.

Anyway.

The day after the incident, I decide the only way I can possibly find some inner peace was to just hop in my car and barrel down to Cape Cod blasting some Smashing Pumpkins while plowing through some shitty gas station snacks. Sour gummies, green can Pringles, Red Bull, Combos, Funions, and glazed donuts, I think the cashier may have thought I was delivering a final meal to a death row inmate. I found relief in periodically pulling down my rearview mirror, looking at my stupid swollen face and yelling “fuck!” (I definitely freaked out a passing Prius full of millennials; sorry guys)

I drive to the very end of the cape, find a serene beach parking lot and watch the sea. I hadn’t eaten in days, so I open my first bag of Doritos and let me tell you, it was the best thing I have ever felt on my tongue. Life is at that moment, if only fleeting, was peaceful. It was cold outside and the sand was whipping my car windows. I was in my bedroom slippers, high on MSG, and heartbroken but somehow, very calm.

As I feel my chest loosen and shoulders drop, his ringtone blasts over my favorite Bonnie Raitt ballad. I want to deny the call because fuck you! for interrupting the first minute of peace I’ve felt since seeing the black and white deceit, but I figure that as I watch the whitecaps bounce up, the time for closure would be fitting to match the tumult that the sea and I shared.

His voice is flat. We share no pleasantries. He said he just spoke to his therapist (*also!* god bless this women and give her a raise because, christ on a cracker, I’m sure that with all of his issues, he will undoubtedly be her lifes work).

He tells me she had just suggested that he should just tell me everything and that after hearing it, it is unlikely I will forgive him. I'm open to listening and embark on this juicy adventure so I am all ears and completely silent, refuse to add even an umm or ok. I even put him on mute so I can enjoy my Doritos in hedonistic peace while he goes on his diatribe of excuses.

He admits that he has been maintaining a relationship with his wife even though they were “broken up” since October, and existed just as friends. He *tries over and over* to distance himself from her but the problem is- he has some strong and unrelenting psychological tie to her. She has some sort of hold over him that he cannot let go of and that when they were actually dating, he had been trying to break up with her for 2 years but just couldn't. He says there is so much history to let go of and he doesn’t know how to get rid of it and he wants to TRY to make sense of it. He says he needs to figure it all out and wants to be with me but it wouldn’t be right to be doing that “work” while being with me because I would be correct and justified in feeling suspicious of his behaviors and actions. Also, that he and I can’t be together for at least a few weeks because he needs to get the psychological space correct because that’s what fucked up his actions with me. He says that she needs to be psychologically out of his life, not just physically.

I am silent. Hearing the passion and turmoil in his voice while referring to her, I realize he will never truly get over her, it’s over between us, and what we had could have not even possibly been real. Even if he did TRY, I don’t want to be the second priority, the consolation prize and why should I? Even though I was in love with him, I shouldn’t have to wait and hope that one day he wakes up and decides I’m his priority. The whole concept is maddening.

As he goes on, he said that he never expected to fall in love with someone (me) so fast and that he knew he needed to end things with her but it was just a monkey on his shoulder and he kept putting it off to spare her feelings so she wouldn't have a meltdown, he said that her meltdowns were the worst times of his life.

He also kept reiterating that he was apprehensive to tell me about his relationship with her because he “loved me so much” and was deathly afraid of losing me. Like, how does this even make sense? YOU CANT HAVE ALL OF THE CAKE BRO.

He then said that he’s **never** loved someone like the way he loves me and and said he’d **never** treated anyone so terribly ever in his whole and doesn’t understand why he did it. Gee, thanks! My first instinct was to blame myself, my crooked teeth and armpit fat, my kankles and grey hair, I deserved it. As you approach 40, I guess you put up with more shit from men than when you were a perky lil 26 year old. I really have to get over this concept and gain some self-confidence. Shit, maybe I should spend my stim check on some botox and a climbing gym membership.

He also maintained they are not having sex and haven’t since October. To be safe, I went to my local clinic this morning to get an STD test and my nurse was this amazing, stylish African-American woman and she goes, “OH honey he cheated on you during COVID?? Girl, ain’t he scared?!” I laughed for the first time in a while and it felt so good. I love and appreciate nurses so much. If I do find out I have the Clap, someone is leaving Cambridge in a **body bag.** OH ALSO (you guys are gonna love this) I am on an immunosuppressive medication that makes me very susceptible to colds and viruses, and this whole time he had been exposing me to her and her families germs/viruses. I am so immunocompromised and asthmatic, that if I did get Covid I would likely be in a critical/ near death situation. This aspect of selfishness may have been the most hurtful part.

In closure, he said that he obviously has some psychological issues to get through and has to figure out why he is the way he is.

At this point I can’t help but start to cry because I am just gutted and weak and I have no idea what my reasoning was but I open my heart to him and proclaimed that I had never felt love for anyone else the way I felt love for him and thought he was put on this earth for us to be together, maybe I wanted to let hm feel how bad he fucked up. He just replied with “yeah”. Literally just said “yeah”

I hung up. As I drove home, I realized I fell in love with a man he *pretended* to be and not the real human he actually is. It was like I had spent the past 6 months of my life living in and watching a movie that starred me. Being happy, in love and then enter in stage left: some actor with a cute accent, nice abs, and made me tea in the afternoon.

I also then go down a spiral of self-loathing and start comparing myself to her and explore frantically why I alone am not good enough for him… She possibly provided intellectual stimulation for him that I cannot fulfill. She is highly educated and witty. If we did decide to move on as a couple he will become tired of me because when he had her and me, both aspects of what he needed were being fulfilled and when and if left with just me, there is no her, no intellect and passion. I was just a cook, a laundry lady and a hole. I realize my place.

I cry very hard, go to sleep and wake up feeling closure.

The next morning I receive a text from him that says he wants me to know that “he is going to meet with his ex later in the week to establish they cannot be friends and and that he is committed to me, If there is any chance we can recover from this he wants to make it happen.” I ask him why he can’t just call her THAT DAY and he says that he needs to see her in person to do it and that he needs a few days because he is confused and he has to get his head in check because it was all over the place. He feared he may back out because she is so manipulative and convincing and he doesn’t trust himself.

Tuesday, midday he calls me and is frantic, jittery and talking a mile a minute. He’s out of breath, like this kid had just won the Ironman Triathlon. He’s joyfully crying and says. “I did it, I told her about you and she was fine with it! She didn’t even care! She is even seeing someone too, I am free, it’s like a weight off my shoulders, I’m free of her. I want to be with you and I will prove that you can trust me, I want to be with you!” I stay silent. I think- so what happened to these “weeks” he had just claimed to have needed to free himself psychologically from her? They just magically resolved themselves in a 15 minute conversation? Miraculous! Eye roll.

He goes on, sounding so triumphant and breathy “there is nothing in the way now, we can move on and be together” Ummm, nothing in the way?! The betrayal is VERY MUCH IN THE WAY. How about the past 3 months of you lying to me every day? Me never being able to believe a single word you say? Resenting you for everything you had done without conscience. Does he really think I am supposed to just instantly trust him and have him over for some chicken tetrazzini and sex on Saturday night? Also, I start to highly doubt this conversation with his wife even happened. I believe not a thing that comes out of his mouth anymore, so I am unmoved and just sigh. He then adds that he wants us to go to couples therapy and he’s going to look into it. I let him rant for a few minutes and ALL I say to him is “I’m glad you feel good” He’s such a narcissist that I felt this would be a fitting dig.

I cut off the call by saying I have to go because I am getting a call on the other line from my Creative Director. I sit with the news and for a few minutes. For a few minutes I sat and watched the trees blow and wondered if love really does “conquer all”. I felt like somehow I could find it in myself to believe him and learn to trust him again and that I had “won”. I felt happy. Then I felt really, really stupid. I opened up all of the screenshots I had saved from the concise reddit comments I received and realized there was no way it would ever happen between us and would be a precious waste of the last few years of my thirties.

Wednesday, I go outside to check my mailbox only to find a bundle of flowers and a letter on the floor of my porch. I open the letter, can’t read his handwriting and quickly decide I don’t even care to decipher it. It went right in the bin (it was trash day too, thank god.)

I blocked his phone number. I don’t have the emotional bandwidth to tell his wife what he’s been up to and is she has half a brain, I’m sure she knows. Also, if she truly is suicidal I don’t want the inofrmation that came from my mouth to be the catalyst for her death or mental breakdown.

This crazy train had officially reached its final destination.

In a weird state of brazen bliss, I walk across the street and give the flowers to my elderly Mexican neighbor that had been painting his porch steps. He seemed confused at first but I think he eventually understood what was up… unless his jefita rolls thru tomorrow and hurls a chancla at me ….which would still probably hurt less than this meteor burning through my chest.

Have a good weekend everyone.

649,40,106,How can I (26m) get my ex (29f) to stop sending me money?,7.0,gwkqfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gwkqfr/how_can_i_26m_get_my_ex_29f_to_stop_sending_me/,28.0,1591316817.0,"We were together for about seven years. Back in September I found out she had started an emotional, physical, and financial relationship with her 40y/o zoomba teacher.

It occurred to me later that I was being emotionally abused in the relationship. She'd say things like ""you'll never get anyone like me ever again"" ""I'm the best thing that ever happened to you"", even in front of my friends. She would use me as an emotional punching bag when she was angry at literally anything. The last couple months specifically it was the mere existence of traffic, shed call me screaming that nobody on the road respects that she had been working all day, and would just unload her frustration on me with a lot of cursing and screaming. One time she actually hit me and it was somehow my fault. She loved punishment. She intentionally killed some of my plants once because I left some beer cans on the patio after a party.

So we had dogs. One that she raised from a puppy and the other I got before we moved in together. I'm in a much more stable position, she moved out of my house, and being that her dog is getting older we decided not to separate them because he would likely just become depressed and give up on life if he was separated from his brother.

I fucking love those dogs. I've been the one to take them to the vet appointments for the last four years, my name is on all the paperwork in our state, I bring them to the park, and keep them groomed. It pains me to say this that I think the only way to get her out of my life would be to give up my dogs, but even then I don't think she would leave me alone after that.

It's a fucked up thought experiment if you ask me. Would you give up something you love to get rid of something you dislike? The answer for me is no. And my family tells me to ""not let her bother me"" but what I realize now is that as a victim of emotional abuse it gives me anxiety when she backs me into a corner and tries to dominate me.

So here we arrive at the question. She has been sending me money for the first time since September. Great right? So far I've received about $250. But she won't communicate with me about any of the schedule for it, there's no purpose, she just puts in the memo our dogs name and her last name. I wish I could say she's doing it out of love, but apparently I have some ptsd because every time she does this it makes me anxious there's some greater manipulative fucked up thing that she's going to come back. Maybe take me to court or something absolutely insane, I'm not sure. 

The only way I can refuse the money is to either send it back, stop online banking, or delete zelle entirely, which the last two options are pretty inconvenient for my life.

I've tried very hard to maintain a neutral demeanor in communicating with her. I even told her since she was out of work in covid not to worry about sending me money, I know she's good for it, let's just wait till this virus blows over. She said no and sent me money. The last two times she's just sent money and  has completely ignored my messages along the lines of ""hey, I received the cash thank you. Can you please tell me why you're sending it tho? I appreciate you trying to help out but if we're gonna do this we should at least make a schedule so it's fair and equal""

Dead silence. Refuses to communicate with me.

I keep on hearing ""just take the money, you shouldn't worry about it, don't let it bother you"" but again it stresses me out, and is a huge distraction when you know that someone is playing mental chess and trying to back you into a corner. Like why put my dog with her last name in the memo? What kind of fucked up games are you playing here? Why can't you be an adult about this?

On top of all that she told the mailman that we were going through a divorce and I got the house so hold the mail at the office. What??? We were never married. She keeps on referring to the dogs as her kids and is like, weirdly cosplaying a fantasy of being in our 40s and having a custody fight.

Anyway, how do I get her to stop sending me money, start communicating reasonably, or if I should just give up my dogs entirely? It's really bumming me out.

Tl;Dr emotionally abusive ex is dominating me financially and I don't know how to stop it or how to cope with it all. Should I just let her win and give her the dogs just to get her out of my life?",2020.0,6.0,5.0,06:11:57,victim,40
650,41,110,I (30 F) am letting my insecurities about platonic same sex friend put strain on my relationship with my boyfriend (25 M). Need advice.,98.0,ge4l6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ge4l6p/i_30_f_am_letting_my_insecurities_about_platonic/,86.0,1588736639.0,"Background of our current relationship:

I’ve been with him for over 6 years, living together for 4. The last year and a half we’ve had a lot of ups and downs in comparison to the other years. I struggle with social anxiety, PTSD, and was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder 12 years ago. Ive recently went back to therapy to start working on my issues again but lately, my anxiety has been at a constant 100. I know this has severely impacted our relationship and the connection we have. He sat me down a few weeks ago to have a serious conversation with me and told me he felt like we weren’t as close as we were in the earlier years of our relationship. I told him I felt the same as I noticed him talking to me less and interacting with me less as the months had passed. We both decided that this is not the path we want to continue, and decided we will work on several areas to improve our relationship and we both want to feel close again. This was the first time we were able to talk maturely as adults on this topic without having a screaming match or turning it into an argument in a long, long time.



A few months ago, he mentioned the name of a girl that came up in conversation, let’s call her Tina. He said that he had recently got in touch with one of his old friends from school and explained that she was one of his best friends throughout middle school and high school. He explained that they lost contact for a few years after high school (we started dating shortly after this time) as some friends typically do after graduating. There was nothing more to that conversation other than him filling me in on some details about a lost connection (which I appreciated him keeping me in the loop about). As the days passed, I noticed they would text every so often. Since I am admittedly jealous person and understand I have many insecurities I need to work through, of course my mind starts spinning. But I told myself not to lose control of my emotions and stay rational in the fact that he is allowed to talk to other women, especially if he’s openly telling me about them.

A few weeks after they had been chatting a bit, my boyfriend had a day off of work, while I was at work I got a text message around 1 PM of him saying he had just got back from lunch with his friend Tina, and that they wanted to catch up. I asked him why he didn’t tell me beforehand that he had plans with her. He said that it was last minute and didn’t think it was a big deal as they are just old friends. I reminded myself that he does this even with his guy friends (doesn’t need to tell me every single plan he has with friends if I’m off doing something else without him). I told myself I would sit on this for a bit to see if it still bothered me in a few days. As a few days passed, I started to feel more anxious and felt like I was becoming overwhelmed and did something I’ve never done to him before. I checked the messages on his phone between him and her. To my surprise, I actually found some dialogue between them that said she was excited to meet me, and nothing else inappropriate at all. After a couple of days, i felt better about it and decided not to bring it up in a way that made me seem like I was being jealous, so I asked him about her and explained i was slightly uncomfortable with his friend because I knew nothing about her and haven’t met her before. He told me he would like me to meet her and would see about arranging something. This immediately made me feel better.

A few weeks later, I noticed they have been texting more and more, and she came by our house and I met her for the first time. I didn’t get any strange feelings from her and she was actually really cool. I could see myself being friends with her. As the night went on (after a few drinks), I gained enough courage to exchange phone numbers with her. The next day, she actually texted me and we had a conversation for a bit, even her telling me a few things that were going on with her “relationship problems” (she is still I communication with her ex but they are at odds currently). I started feel more comfortable but for some reason in my head, I was going back and forth with my feelings that surely something has to be up with my boyfriend and her, even though there was no definitive evidence.

I decided to finally have a talk with my boyfriend about it. I explained that I’m for some reason uncomfortable with him having such a close female friend and that I’m not used to this in a relationship. I told him it bothers me that they text so frequently, but I was struggling to rationalize these feelings because he texts his guy friends frequently too. I admitted that I thought I was jealous simply because she’s a female, and also that it’s possible I’m feeling that the recent conversation him and I had about our lack of connection lately, may attribute to me feeling almost like he is “closer” to her as far as communication and conversations goes.

He went on to explain to me that he has known he for over almost 15 years and she was close to him and his family growing up throughout school. He said they have never had romantic feelings towards one another and their relationship is strictly friends, almost like brother and sister. He provided so much reassurance to me that I was the only one he wants, and that if he wanted to go be with her, he would go be with her. But instead, he’s coming home to me at the end of the day. He even told me that he wants me to become friends with her because he wants me to be comfortable with her, and also wanted to help me make a new friend, since I struggle with making friends due to my social anxiety. I was so relieved to hear how open about the whole thing he was being.

I also asked him the types of things they talk about and he was very open with it as well. He said mostly she talks to him about some of her issues with her ex, as well as just random stuff like what they did that day, some funny memes, basically just mundane stuff that doesn’t have a ton of depth. I asked him if he ever talked about me and he said he mentions me to her sometimes, like for example about how I cooked a delicious meal that night and may sent her a picture of what I cooked. He said he would never talk to her about personal details of our relationship, especially if we were having issues.

Tina ended up coming over again the next weekend. There were times where her and I were in the room together and were able to have one on one conversation. She shared some personal things with me about her last relationship, about how he ex was very controlling. She explained that one of the reasons my boyfriend and he stopped contacting each other is because he didn’t want her to have an guy friends, period. She said her boyfriend would constantly go through her text messages and try to fish for stuff that wasn’t there. After she told me this, I felt so terrible that I was in fact having these same feelings of control for my boyfriend and their relationship.

I found myself needing to bring up this relationship between Tina and my boyfriend to him almost on a daily basis. I needed constant reassurance that there wasn’t anything in inappropriate going on, and that he wasn’t going to develop feelings for her. After my boyfriend and I talk about it, I immediately feel better for a few hours, then I go right back to thinking about it and being anxious about it again.

I feel the constant need to check in on him and this relationship, even though there is 0 evidence of malicious behavior between both of them. She clearly wants to be my friend too, and my boyfriend has been forthcoming about their entire friendship, even down to what they talk about with each other. For some reason it still bothers me how frequently they text each other, even though he texts his guy friends the same amount. It’s evident that my boyfriend and Tina are both “talkers”, and it’s easy for me to interpret this incorrectly, i think because I wish my boyfriend talked to me that much.

I explained this to him and he said he’s positive if we keep working on our relationship and gain a connection again, we will begin talking more frequently again and he thinks I’ll feel better about this whole situation.

My past relationships have been very very bad, often abusive and controlling. Because of this, I often have a hard time identifying what’s actually a red flag and whats actually just me being insecure. I am well aware that I feel like I’m not enough, and constantly fear that he will leave me for another woman whom perhaps he will develop a better connection with. No matter how much he reassures me, I wake up feeling sick about this every day to the point where I’m losing weight because I can’t eat because I’m so anxious over this.

I realize this is a bit lengthy but I’m having trouble understanding myself right now, and maybe having an outsider listen to this and having a different and more healthy perspective will help me get through this. Do you think this friendship is something I should be concerned about or is this truly me being so insecure and jealous? Is this normal in a relationship (sorry I have no healthy relationship experience prior to compare it to to determine if this is normal or not)?

I don’t want to push him away by constantly having to bring this up, but I’m afraid if I don’t bring it up, he will think he can go do whatever her wants with another female if he sees me not getting upset about anything. I realize this behavior is totally backwards and unacceptable and that this in fact will only cause him to be less attracted to me. I hate how out of control i feel with my emotions, where jealousy and anxiety often turn to rage and despair very quickly. I absolutely hate that I am like this and it’s embarrassing to even talk about.

651,42,112,"Back together with a formerly emotionally abusive BF. Will his ""changed behavior"" last or should I run?",1.0,gdpmsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gdpmsj/back_together_with_a_formerly_emotionally_abusive/,22.0,1588675313.0,"Hi everyone! I apologize in advance if this is a lot of reading, but you have no idea how much I appreciate your help. I am a complete confused mess now, and really really need neutral advice.

I posted on here about three months back (it is not allowing me to link the original post.)

To give a summary of the original post (if you don't want to read it), my BF (33 M) and I (32 F) had been together for 9 months. We talked about marriage and kids and all that. We have a LOT in common and want the same things in the future. But as the nine months progressed, I saw more and more mood swings and EXTREME and strange reactions to things that are minimal (see original post for examples.) At times he would say things that are so cruel, it must be to intentionally hurt me. I wasn't sure, but think it may have been emotional abuse. I think he may have slight borderline personality disorder, also he is in AA.

Some examples to prove his reactions are not ""normal"":

\-One time he told me he didn't like my personality because I ""bothered"" him by pointing out a long line at a deli.

\-He was rude/left the restaurant the first time meeting my best friend (this was only 2 months in!) because her BF didn't come with us to dinner (he never was supposed to come, my BF just got mad for some reason 5 mins into dinner and left.)

\-Once I told him that I heard on the news it would snow later that day so he left work. It didn't snow. He got FURIOUS with me because I ""caused"" him to leave work and told me he could never trust me again.

\-He was wearing the same hat as a woman. I pointed out they had the same hat and he BLEW UP raging mad for 6 hours because I ""called him feminine.""

\-He shaved his head during quarantine and I jokingly said ""WOW! You're a different person."" I said it two separate times on facetime because he did look totally different! He thought I was insulting his appearance and didn't understand how I don't realize this is insulting. Fuming mad about this.

\-We were going to visit my sister in another city. I was really excited and he knew all the plans. One involved dinner with her friends. The night before we went he asked me ""Do you really think I want to hang out with your sister and all her little friends?""

\-He was in a horrible mood. We had gotten a gift card for a certain restaurant and went that night. The music was loud and it felt ""going-out ish."" He got in an even worse mood and wouldn't talk to me at all. I said I know this isn't your first choice place, but you're a grown up and this is date night, can't we just make the best of it? All he said was ""let's just get this over with, I hope the food comes fast"". We sat in uncomfortable silence the whole meal.

\-The other night he asked me to leave his apt at 2:30 am because he couldn't sleep. Apparently he was annoyed that my dog was sleeping in bed and that I left her water bowl in the middle of the apartment without asking him first. I was sound asleep and had to walk home through the streets of NYC at 2:30 am with my dog.

\-His brother works at a restaurant and his hours are being cut. My uncle owns a company in the same town. I asked my uncle if his company was hiring (I did not give his brother's name or anything), and if my uncle said yes, my plan was to pass the info on to my BF and then he and his brother could make a decision about whether to apply. He got FURIOUS that I asked. ""How dare I get involved with his brother or his family."" I literally was only trying to help. He could have said that was nice but no thanks. Instead he told me he's not sure he loves me anymore and doesn't know if he wants me to meet his family (we were leaving for me to meet his family for the first time the following week.) He also came into my apartment without telling me first to search for and take his keys back as a result of this.

In the original post, about 150 people answered and the VAST majority was to RUN.

So where I am now.

I broke up with him the end of January right after I posted that original post. He reached out a month later and we have been ""trying"" again the last two months. We are not officially together but trying. My issue is that things have been so perfect the last two months and now I don't know what to do (also someone smartly pointed out that in quarantine he has many fewer stresses in terms of commuting and work that would often cause the mood swings.) I think I love him, but I don't love those parts of him. And I am TERRIFIED it will go back to how it was (if it does, I'm gone.) But I also haven't seen those parts of him in two months, so maybe it's better? Or maybe he's just on his best behavior. He has been in therapy now for five months, but can therapy really change his personality? I know that we will argue, that's a given, but it can't get to the point that it was. It was horrific towards the end and I was basically always on eggshells waiting for the next explosion.

Basically, what do I do??? Please help. Most people in my life hate him for how he treated me in the past and can't get past that if I were to give him a second chance. I don't even honestly know if I want to give him a second chance, because can people really change? Also, yesterday was my birthday and I am now 32 and TERRIFIED to not be able to have a family based on my age. I almost feel like he is my last chance and the last thing I want to do is date again. I have a really hard time meeting people I click with.

PLEASE, PLEASE HELP. I cannot stop crying and I just don't know how to make the decision of whether to stop wasting time and just end it, or keep going to see if he really has changed.

Thank you SO much!!

I have decided just to ignore and block everyone. I appreciate you all. 


TLDR: I’ve been in contact with some friends that are still closely associated with my ex. After some inner work that I’ve done and observations from some of these connected people, I think I need to end some relationships with some friends because I feel like they might be telling info to my ex (who was abusive on many levels). How do I respectfully say that I’m going to dip out for a while?


So I was in a very abusive relationship with my ex for almost 6 years. Last week, I had someone who I thought was a friend try to tell me that my ex was not in the wrong for his abuse and that I just triggered him on certain things, so that’s why he abused me and that I should open up to talk to him— messed up, I know.

Anyways, so thinking about that statement, it made me realize that I will need to stop being friends with mutual connections. I.E. a few months ago: one of the mutual friends told my ex the day that I was moving out and put me in danger because he was at a very unstable point after our breakup where I actually feared for getting beaten by him with how angry he was at me (nothing happened, but— I was having constant anxiety attacks until everything was moved out because my ex kept texting and directing me what to move). I don’t know why, but I have continued to be friends with that person. No need to come for me though, I realize that is not a good choice on my end. I also recently moved to a new place and the last thing that I need my abusive ex to know where I live and get harassed while I’m walking around outside. 

Is there a way to basically drop connection in a kind and thoughtful way to these mutual friends by telling them that I need to stop being friends with them because I need to fully cut all ties back to him? In any other situation outside of Coronavirus, I would have just ghosted them. However, with this pandemic affecting so many families and the families of our mutual friends, I want to exit these relationships (temporarily or even permanently) in the kindest way possible.",2020.0,5.0,14.0,04:02:34,victim,

Long story short she was mentally, emotionally and physically abusive in our time together, and continued to be both emotionally and mentally abusive after we broke up. I finally got the nerve to block her a year ago after she wouldnt leave me alone to insult me. A few months back I unblocked her because I found out there was a fire in her apartment complex, on her floor just 7 doors from her apartment. So I unblcoked her hoping to find out if she was okay

Last week I was on my messenger app and saw her profile icon as being active, meaning she unblocked me. I didnt message her and just closed the app. In hindsight I should have blocked her. 
But I mentioned it to a friend over xbox live. 

Now me and him have been friends for over 20years. Hes always been gay and I knew he was before he came out. After he came out I still treat him the same and love him like a brother. Hes one of my best friends, and his family essentially adopted me as a young kid when my mom relapsed and fell back into drugs.
So he knows about Ll the damage and emotional damage she has done to me. He knows she is one of the primary reasons I'm seeing a therapist and am on antidepressants. 

So she messaged me mocking me. Telling me my best friend messaged her telling her to not even think of messaging me, to stay out of my life. That he was only messaging her because hes in love with me and wants the best for me. Not that he loves me, but is deeply in love with me. I dont understand why he felt the need to say that to her but she did. But she told me all that and did so in a mocking way, even calling him several slurs.
I've since blocked her and didnt even respond
But now I dont know what to do about my friend. 

He has no clue I know he messaged her and no clue I know hes in love with me. I dont know if I should talk to him about it, thank him for supporting me, or getting mad. I dont know if he messaged her for my sake or for his. I obviously still love him, but like a brother. I'm straight. Theres no chance I will ever reciprocate his feelings. But I have no clue how to feel now knowing all this or how I should even go about talking to him about it.

Hes invited me to numerous xbox live parties over the past two days and I just message him saying I'm too tired from work. I cant avoid him forever.

Everything seemed to be going in the right direction for us. We both work at his family’s business, we we’re saving for a home in the suburbs, we were planning our dream wedding. Unfortunately Monday that all went to hell in a hand basket. 

When we first met, we both had a habit of partying a lot, experimenting with drugs and binge drinking. He was engaged to his high school sweet heart but they had broken up and moved on. On the outside my fiancé seemed like a dream come true kind of guy and deep down i been waiting for a guy that made me not want to party anymore, I had greater aspirations for myself and wanted to be better at my career (at the time I was working for myself before joining his families business) I wanted to feel better mentally and physically, and I wanted a family. I felt he wanted the same too. So like a switch I stopped doing drugs and over drinking. I started to distance myself from the rag tag bunch that I did these activities with spent more time with career driven friends. 

Unfortunately my ex did not follow suit. He said he wanted to change but continued to abuse cocaine and drink all night. Multiple times I would have to cover him and show up to meetings in his place! He would fight me constantly about having guy time and was unwilling to separate from his druggy friends. 

6 months ago we started seeing a drug addiction couples counselor so we could set some boundaries. I also learned his ex fiancé and him broke up for similar reasons. The therapist suggested to being accountable. If the ex wants to go out then he is limited to 2 beers and has to be home by the time he says he will. However he broke that trust every 2 weeks. He go out with the guys, say he be home by 9. He arrives home at 1am strung out on coke. I would go to my parents for a week until he could learn what he was doing was wrong. His family even had an intervention telling him he’s engaged and needs to focus on family and the business but never punished him just kept giving affirmation. I felt his parents relied on me to take care of him and made sure he got better. 

This continued on like so even in quarantine. We started fighting everyday and the arguments began getting more heated. This last Monday he took it too far when he told me he was going out with friends and didn’t know when he’d be back. I calmly asked him if he was planning on getting high and what the expectations were. And just like a spark to lighter fuel he flipped the table over and started breaking and throwing my belongings. Screaming to get the F out of his house and he didn’t want to be with me anymore. He was screaming an inch from my face calling me a pathetic bitch. I called his mother in panic and all she could say to us “get some space, sorry”. I packed a bag and left our house to my parents. 

The next day he apologized for what he had done and that he missed me. I explained I wanted to move out and calmly he agreed. He asked if we broke up and I said I needed a month without him to see how I really felt. 

I’m so scared to leave because although I wrote all the horrible things, the sober person in him is a complete gentleman. He’s sweet, shows interest in my hobbies and gave support in tough or sad times (outside his addiction). Even my parents loved him and gave him their blessing. 

I don’t know where to start on decoupling my items and how to properly leave the family business without losing my commissions I split with my fiancé.  I never had done this before. I’m having a horrible time trying not to blame myself for this because he does pay all the bills and takes care of me, he would constantly tell me I should cut him some slack and let him have a night a week to do what he wants for all that he has given. I just felt so strongly if we were going to start a family in the next few years he would need to kick the habit. 

The last thing he said to me was “I’m so tired of you and our family expecting me to grow into the man I’m expected to be, I’m not ready to grow up” 

I guess I’m turning to this sub if anyone has gone through what I’m going through and what was the outcome...do they get help and grow up or do they remain the same?

655,46,127,I'm (52m) fighting with my wife (55f) because I bought alcohol for our son,352.0,g2b070,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/g2b070/im_52m_fighting_with_my_wife_55f_because_i_bought/,101.0,1587054346.0,"My son is 24 y.o. and he hasn't lived with us since 18 when he left for university, but he regularly comes over for holidays, reunions with family and high school friends and similar. He was actually visiting shortly before the government passed the measures forbidding anyone to leave their town without a doctor's or employer's pass or urgent need, so he decided to stay with us until this craze blows over. He works remotely (from his computer) so this part wasn't an issue.

We decided that since I am the only one required to leave home for my job, as I work for a restaurant which still delivers food, I would do all the food shopping after shifts. Son pitches in with his money for specifically his groceries even though I told him it's not necessary, but he says he'd feel guilty if he didn't participate in some way.  


My son's job is stressful and some clients have an increased volume of demands lately with all the new measures and regulations. To explain a little more, he mostly translates legal documents, contracts and correspondences for banks and international corporations, which here usually have foreign directors so everything has to be handed to them in an English version.

I know he likes to drink a little too much sometimes when going out with friends. But until he's been staying with us this month, I didn't realize how much he drinks, almost every day. Usually strong spirits but if they aren't around, he pours himself our wine, glass after glass. He has started asking me to get him whiskey or vodka when I go grocery shopping, as it helps him relax when the work is stressful and concentrate better. I told him that's not a good idea, especially because he's recently been having unusual amount of headaches which may be connected to his drinking. I have some anti-anxiety medications to help when my back hurts so bad I can't sleep, but I rarely use them these days. I told him to try that or maybe ask his doctor for a similar prescription because of stress and I'd pick it up when I'm outside. He refuses to and insists only a few shots or glasses of alcohol help because the medication just makes him sleepy and de-concentrated.

In the end I gave up because we were starting to argue and got him alcohol. Then again some more yesterday, because last week I picked up a 0,75 litre bottle which he says wasn't enough since he's working on a really long and difficult project with a short deadline. I don't know what to say. Some days he really doesn't drink, or at least I don't see it. He isn't aggressive either when he drinks, or acts much different except he eats a bit more. I don't want to control him because he's way past the age of child-parenting and besides, he only lives with us during quarantine. Although the regular spirit drinking at his age... I can't lie, scares me.

The whole point is that when my wife noticed how much our son drinks and then found out I'm buying him alcohol, she went crazy. She sees him a lot more like still a child than I do, so maybe that's the reason for our reactions. We are both scared, however. But we don't know what to do. If I'm doing grocery shopping and my son asks, ""dad can you get me a packet of chips"" and moreover, gives me his own money for it, of course I'll get it. Alcohol is more dangerous than chips but I don't think I can control any of that anyway. He would probably just go out and get it on his own. My wife thinks we should once again talk and try to convince him about anxiety pills or calling his doctor. I don't know because that didn't go over well last time, when he started arguing and got mad like I know more about his health than he does.

Tldr: I'm kind of lost and scared in this situation and don't know what to do about my son possibly abusing alcohol and wife being extremely worried about it.",2020.0,4.0,16.0,22:10:46,victim,24

He proposed. Out of the blue.

He involved our 3 months old. I was taking a picture of him for celebrating is third month, nothing big or very elaborated.

He (38M) usually works in the morning in his studio, I waited until the afternoon, so we could our picture together, got the camera and snapped few photos and then he wanted to change the baby into his superman t-shirt. I didn't notice anything until I spotted something shining was tied to his shirt.

Well, P. was on his knee. So serious that made me worried and not really understand what was going on. Then he said the words, took my hands and waited my answer. I wish I had a more composed reaction, but it was so out of the blue.

I (36F) wrote on Reddit how my low self-esteem was getting in a way of enjoying a surprise pregnancy, how a decade of violent abuse crushed completely, how this this relationship who started as FWB scared me, because P. was asking for more but I couldn't see myself able to be a girlfriend at the old age of 36. I wrote how wonderful he was when I opened up to the need of getting into therapy, how I was feeling down and disgusted by the fact that I was ""forcing"" him to share fatherhood with a slob, full of mental illness, good only for a fuck or two. How hard was with dealing with his perfect family, perfect and much involved ex wife. I wrote about how his ex was invited on their annual holiday abroad and even made a small updated (that got cancelled by mistake) where he simply talked about how we should buy a proper home, with a studio for me so I can do yoga or go back to study or a relax room. In nearly 37 years old, I never experienced someone that included me, as a person, in their plan. I sobbed a lot, few days ago and he was sweet to tell me that we are doing this together and that I deserve me-time and my space to do whatever I want.

I am still over the moon for what happened that day.

So many people stopped me, advice me, wrote privately, spilled some tea and share their prospective. Even if it's weird to say, you guys helped so much, even when the comments were negative because it helped me to ""wake me up"" and work for me and my little baby.

So, here we are. I said yes, I think I just whispered, because I was very confuse. He had to ask me again and then, I started to come back to reality. I started to ask him if he was sure, that I didn't need formal commitment, he got divorced not long ago and has the right to take his time, we already have something special. Then I started to go all the way, like I do even here, with my self-doubts by telling him that I was not enough, that I didn't have anything valuable to bring on the table, he could aspire for so much more and so on. This time he let me finish and then repeated the question again, adding that I make him happy and that's the only thing it's important, and if he makes me happy, we are fine.

I am quite blown away about all the little things he managed to sort out in the middle of a pandemic. The ring is a normal ring, he assured me it's not expensive (I don't want him to spend so much when there is so much financial disparity) but he went through my ""zodiac books"" which I like to read and quote but don't really believe in it and found that red stones are birthstones for Capricorn, which is the baby's sign. So the ring has a garnet and it fits perfectly. He was nervous that I would not be enthusiast of an Etsy ring, but I am perfectly happy. He wants to go to shop for something more precious later, but surely I can convince him to not do it. I am over the moon already.

I have a video-therapy session soon, so I can process better and continue my therapy. I still so much that I need to improve and I am still so messy. For now, I am sitting in the bedroom, they are in the living room hanging around so I can rest a bit, but I can't. I am overexcited and scared.

What should I do? What people do after an engagement? They tell people?

I am in no contact with all of them expect my half-sister which we texted when my baby was born and she replied. I don't want to start to go in the usual loop of ""1000s while P should run because I am not normal - Part 26"". He told that only a friend knows and a colleague from work because one of them had bought rings from Etsy. I asked him to wait for the end of pandemic, so I can get used to it and clear my head. I have two friends, but we live far away.

Should I ask my therapist if we can do a session together? Sometimes I feel his struggle to understand me and my mental issues. He is supportive but never had huge conflict during his childhood. I still have CPTSD. I can say that the peak of my depression is gone, I still have problems but since my progress on that are evident, maybe he thinks that it's a done deal?

Should I ask for couple therapy?

Or maybe we could read something together so we can approach to all of this better?

He is a lovely man, knows how to communicate and a great supportive partner and friend, but sometimes I feel like he doesn't want to upset me or stressing me, so he doesn't open up and wait for me to ask. I want to be able to says everything he wants, confide or just vent without thinking I can't handle it.

Did you had similar problems? How you overcome all this feelings?

Thank you very much lovely strangers!

TL;DR : He proposed. I said yes. I still have to overcome all my mental problems and my self-esteem is low enough that I lose precious time to compare myself to hi ex or sister. Should I ask him to participate to my therapy session? How can I approach the fact that he treats me very gently and he is rarely frustrated with me?",2020.0,4.0,18.0,01:51:40,victim,38
658,49,134,My girlfriends (18F) dad is in my opinion crazy and unstable and could ruin our relationship and I don’t know what to do,2.0,ghigms,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ghigms/my_girlfriends_18f_dad_is_in_my_opinion_crazy_and/,5.0,1589208128.0,"My girlfriend and I (19m) have been dating for nearly 3 years now and we’ve been friends since we were little and our relationship is great and I can honestly say she’s my best friend and that I can see myself marrying her in the future. But there’s just one problem, her dad doesn’t like me and is incredibly unstable and crazy and could ruin our relationship. 

From what my girlfriend has told me he has hit her, her mum, her younger brother (not sure much her younger sister) and has just recently hit her after she defended her brother for being on the computer and watching fortnite videos, he was also drunk and had downed a full body of vodka. He’s also smashed her phone when he saw a message from me saying “I love you too”, this pissed him so much he grabbed his son and told him to direct him to my house because he’d never been there before. I was at the gym and I get a call from my girlfriend crying and the next thing I know I get her mum telling me not to answer the door. I tell my older brother who was at home at the time not to answer it. Eventually her dad got at the house and started banging on the door, he eventually left after no one answered. One time when me and her were studying at the library he calls and asks where she is, this is what I heard, “what the fuck I didn’t know you were with me, fucking cunt”. A lot to take in I know. Whenever we’ve been together he’s seemed pretty civil but that could just be because his wife would be with him and probably told him to be nice. When it was her 18th she invited me and my parents to come and when we did everything seemed nice and I was really relieved. When we were saying goodbye he was so clearly drunk and hugging us goodbye and saying I’m so handsome etc. 

When my girlfriend recently told me he’d hit her I was pissed off and basically said I can’t marry you in the future if your dad continues to act like this as it could potentially put my family in danger as he now knows where I live and if my mum had answered the door when he came and he came and started swearing at her I would of lost my shit. I honestly don’t know what to do, should I break up with her and lose the person I love and care about the most due to her dad or do I continue to date her and if something else happens do I call it off? 

TL;DR- my girlfriends dad is crazy and doesn’t like me for no reason and could potentially lead us to breaking up as I fear what would happen if snapped in front of my parents and other family members. Should I end it with her and lose everything or stay and if something else happens then do I break it off?",2020.0,5.0,11.0,20:27:08,victim,19
659,50,136,"Finally realized why I'm always so defensive against my parents, what do I do now?",24.0,gvlsrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gvlsrp/finally_realized_why_im_always_so_defensive/,11.0,1591182144.0,"I (20 f) realized during the beginning of the pandemic (March in the US) that I couldn't stand being holed up at home with my parents (mom 47, dad 48) every day. I was still trying to finish my spring semester and couldn't understand why literally everything my parents said bugged me. They are very opinionated and sometimes extremely rude. My dad is a condescending jerk a lot of the time, and my mom is passive aggressive beyond belief. My dad will make jokes at me, sometimes about my work ethic, and how often I do chores around the house. My mom, well she tells me to do those chores. And whenever she tells me to do chores I get so unreasonably angry and defensive. It must be the tone of her voice or the way she words the phrase of telling me to do things that pisses me off. 

It took me a while to figure out that, my whole life, they were never very emotionally available for me. It hit me when I was venting to a friend the other day, and she told me that they seem insensitive and seem to invalidate me a lot. She struck the nail right on the head. A light bulb went off... Invalidation. It means people disregard your opinions, beliefs and feelings. This sends the message that your interests and opinions don't matter. It's how I've felt with my relationship to my parents my whole life. So, I thought back through my childhood at all the times I complained or tried to voice my emotions, I was almost always shut down. Instead of them letting me vent or explain myself, they would talk **AT** me. Not to me, but at me. They explain themselves in a way that seems to say ""I'm the parent so don't question me.""

I once told them that I thought I was depressed (thinking back, I was more anxious from GAD and didn't know it) I mentioned that my therapist thought I should get on a medication. At first they seemed somewhat concerned, until I mentioned the medication part. My parents started spouting their opinion on anti-depressants. Again, talking **at** me instead of letting me express my feelings. My dad said that everyone gets stuck in a depressing rut some point in their life, and that you just have to work through it (without the help of drugs). Then I was diagnosed with GAD by my therapist. Neither my mom nor dad have taken my anxiety seriously. When I mention anxiety meds, my mom always says ""try it, but seeing as how sensitive I was to Xanax or Prozac, I think you'll react the same"" and my dad says ""if you don't have to take it, don't. Those chemicals in the meds will ruin your brain chemistry, especially since your brain isn't fully formed yet.""

When I try to talk about things I am researching in college, my mom seems to get bored easily and my dad tries to challenge me half the time, because he's"" older and knows more"" than I do (he literally said that to me once.) I've honestly stopped trying to make any conversation with them because they both go on long and extremely opinionated rants about religion or the recent riots and anti-maskers. I'm sick of constantly listening to them talk and talk about the virus and the news. I understand that these are current events, but my parents let the events consume their entire vocabulary and that's all they can talk about until the next big thing happens. I'm just not interested in talking about these things with my parents. I can talk forever about these topics with friends, because they aren't so *forcefully* opinionated. My friends also let me get a word (actually multiple words) into the conversation. 

My parents, through out my life, have always talked over me, talked at me, interrupted me. They do it to my brother and sister too. And I know it's all because of how my dad was raised. When he was young, if he didn't speak up and raise his voice, as well as interrupt, he'd never get to speak in his family. My mom has adopted some of his ways of speaking just so that **he** doesn't speak over her. But she does it in such a passive aggressive way most of the time. She blames everyone for her own issues. She blames my sisters chaotic life for the reason her blood pressure is dangerously high. She denies that she has anxiety half the time, and the other half of the time tries to relate to me. She denies that she is as passive aggressive (or more) than her own mom, she denies that she needs therapy. She blames the fact that she's become the least nurturing than I've ever seen before on her hysterectomy. I hate talking to her about personal things and feelings. I used to be able to talk to her about it. I used to hug her more. I just can't tell who stopped first, her or me.

Everything feels like a silent threat now. All of her words sound the same to me. My dad and I joke with her (but it's not a joke to me) about how we never know when she is being sarcastic and when she is being serious. Because her sarcastic and serious voice sound the same. And I can't take a joke from her anymore because I fear there's always a cold truth hidden behind the joke. 

My older sister (26) has borderline personality disorder. She abused drugs years ago whenever my parents left her to babysit me and my older brother (23) when we were young (hence why my mom blames my sister for her high blood pressure). My brother is a person with down syndrome. He had to have an open heart surgery when he was 2. I was born premature and doctors told my parents I wouldn't make it through the night. My parents talk about these things all the time, as if we should be grateful we are alive. So, has my family been through some stuff? Sure. I can maybe understand the way that my parents are today by looking at my grandparents and hearing stories about their youth. As well as looking at what they've been through, raising me, my brother and sister.

But God damn. I have never felt so angry as I am recently. I'm constantly snapping at them (passive aggressively too... NOOO!) and avoiding them when I can. I have absolutely no fucking idea how to **TALK** to them about shit because when I do, a few things happen. Well I start bawling. And then my dad calls me ""sensitive"" or ""overly emotional"" for the umpteenth time. My mom will deny anything I say if it applies to her and deflects it to my dad. This can then ensue an argument between them... Not always. But I just feel like I make everything so much worse when I try to say *something*about how I fucking feel. God forbid I have my own needs and emotions, right? Because it's not like that matters. At least that's how I feel. That's how I feel because this is what invalidating your child can do. Oh, and I Googled invalidation as a child, and guess what popped up? Some studies about apparent correlations between borderline personality disorder and invalidation as a child. As well as *anxiety* and depression.

So when the old saying is that you are your parents, well it's more like your paterents *make* you be like them. 

Now I'm at a point where I'm so fucking angry... I can't even look at them. I do not know how to confront them about my feelings. I have a giant fear of confronting my parents. And now I know why. I'll never be validated for feeling the way I do about anything when talking to them. If I were to call out *their* parenting skills? Fuck, I fear I'd be kicked out of the house. Would that actually happen? Probably not. But would I have hell to pay every time I see them? Would I have a million invisible passive aggressive daggers thrown at me by my mom? Probably. Would my dad sit me down and tell me a giant, long, boring story about how his dad made him feel a certain way and that's why he moved out? Probably. But I already know all of this. I *know* this might be how my parents react because they are predictable. Set in their ways. That's another reason I'm terrified of confronting them.

So reddit, please tell me how the fuck do I keep my mental health in check, keep the anger from spilling out, and handle living with them until I'm finished with college? How do I reassure myself that I'm a fucking human being who has *worth* who *matters*? Because I feel like I've never been told that in my life. At least not by those who I need it from the most. And I fear they will never tell me those things. And I fear I will never not need the validation from them. I fear I will always seek it through approval or some other fucking way that keeps me coming back to them, just to be beat down again and to get my emotions tossed in the gutter. 

Thanks ahead of time. 

Edit: I didn't expect such an amount of support and advice from you all! Thank you so much. I will be looking for a place to live, with roommates soon. And I will think about writing my parents letters. Thanks again, I'm very glad I found this community in reddit. :) 

TLDR: I realized my parents have never validated my emotions as long as I've lived. I'm so angry at them, but I fear confronting them. I don't know how to keep the anger at bay until I can figure out a way to civilly state my feelings to them, without fear of my feelings being discounted yet again. I'm not sure I'll ever get the courage to state how I feel to them.",2020.0,6.0,3.0,16:47:24,victim,20

I'm 30(f). I dated Jake when I was 21 for about a year and a half. Even at an age that young I knew there was something special here. We met because I walked by him and his friends and I heard him mention LOST lol. I broke up with him though and I started dating someone else from my class from college. Jake did not take the break up well and was still hung up on me the entire time I dated my boyfriend. Wrote me poems and bought me gifts and such. Truth be told I wasn't over him either, I was stupid and gave into pressure from my circle of friends to break up with Jake and date the other guy since we ""got along so well"". So I stupidly did. Other guy and I dated for about a year and a half too. Meanwhile Jake moved out west for work. I ended up breaking up with other guy because it was a really bad relationship where he cheated on me but I was really relieved - I moved out west too for fun and new and lived with my BFF who lived there. (at this point I'm 24 and Jake is 23)

Jake and I met up, it was literally a scene from a movie when we spotted each other on the street lol I don't think I've ever been that happy to see someone... We rekindled and began dating again a few months later. I should mention that I suffer from depression (surprise surprise) . I have a hard time letting go of things and that included my upbringing - which was not pleasant. I was really close with my Mom, but my dad was abusive and so was her boyfriend after him. They really damaged me mentally. That's a whole other rabbit hole. And I guess I've been taking that baggage along with me, but it really only came out when I would have pretty bad episodes which happened like once a month (still too much I know) where I'd blame my laziness and depression on that on my ""shitty childhood"" and made Jake feel bad that I had to live through that (which I know I have no one to blame but myself and I stopped using that as a weapon) anyway, Jake was extremely understanding and loved me anyway. Tried to help me, and rented me a place close to him when he had to move to a remote place for work (5ish months after we began dating again) . I tried to find a job too, but it was pretty hard living really in the middle of nowhere without a car. But Jake never made me feel worthless. I know I was really difficult a lot, but I still tried to make it up to Jake anyway I can.

Then a few months later after Christmas and after I turned 25, my Mom died. Without going too much into detail, it was the most devastating thing I've ever been through. My number one fear was always my mom dying before I could give her the life she deserved, and because of my depression and laziness, I couldn't give it to her, and she dies. She wasn't in great health. Smoked like 3 packs a day and died in her sleep while her boyfriend was in jail. I shudder to think what would happen if Jake wasn't there with me when I found out. I don't even want to think about it. 

Anyway, the next year was pretty rough. Jake and I moved back home temporarily, I didn't get a iob (I tried. Lazily though) and went back and forth from living with my sister and Jake's mom (who is honestly the nicest woman. She loved me for some reason and always considered me family even when Jake and I weren't dating). My sister and his mom lived 2 minutes away from each other. Jake got a serving job and we pretty much just floated through life for a while. Just hanging out with our friends and being together. I am forever grateful for him and his Mom (and his moms boyfriend who is also amazing) 

Jake and I moved back out west for his job shortly after Christmas that year (his job was really flexible and let him move back home for a while, we were basically home for about 8 months) but it was time to go back. So we did. Then two moths later Jake breaks up with me. At the very start I was okay with it for some reason, thinking it was just temporary since he needs to travel a lot for work. And because he told it was just a ""break"" and I believed him. It was a little unusual because I was renting a bachelor pad and he stayed in hotels when traveling but when he'd come back to stay in the city he'd stay with me... But we'd be broken up... But acting like a couple... 

Anyway, I started to resent him and asked when can we get back together and he said he wasn't really ready and was enjoying his freedom from being tied down to someone. This really hurt a lot, but he is extremely charming and had a way of making it seem like it was okay and that I was okay and that we're still best friends and maybe in the future things will be different. A few months later, I decided to permanently move home because my life was going nowhere out West. I didn't have family or friends (except my bff) but I thought to myself I had to get away from Jake and was maybe even hoping my decision to leave would wake him up. Well it didn't. 

So I moved home and rented a place in a random city not too far from the main city (just don't want to actually list the cities) and I started school (again) for something practical that can just get me a job in an office. That was a two year program. During a portion of that time, I admit I went pretty psycho on Jake, and called him a lot of nasty things. To this day some of the things I said were pretty funny because they were creative and Jake and I would have a laugh about it when I've calmed down. But they were nasty even though I know Jake was kinda just laughing in a ""oohhh Jen that silly girl"" type of way. He never took my threats to cut him off forever seriously because I never would. He never got mad at me ever. The only team I've seen Jake mad is if his favorite hockey team didn't win.

He is a calm and gentle soul which makes this so hard because he's always there for me still when I need him which has made cutting contact with him hard. We also have the came circle of friends and I met my other bff through him. So anytime he came home for a visit, I'd see him. And his Mom and sister still loved me and would keep contact with me and like all my Instagram posts etc which Jake actually really liked. I even still spent Christmas with them despite being broken up, but no one asked questions or acted awkward. They loved having me and has gifts for me ready and such and Jake and I were together like old times. Them he'd go back out west and the resent and the toxicity would start up again. 

There was a year where I dated a guy named Alex. He was a piece of shit and to this day I am ashamed I stuck around for so long. I was in a really bad place both figuratively and literally, I moved into another apartment that had bedbugs and it was ...just the worst... All the while Alex was verbally abusive and drove me insane with his gas lighting but that's another story. The point is, for almost a year I DID basically cut contact with Jake. I went to visit bff out West and didn't see him. There was a week he came home to visit and I didn't see him. It was the longest I had ever gone without talking to him, but it was because one whiff of Jake and Alex would go on a rampage. So again for basically a year, I didn't speak to Jake. Then Alex and I broke up thankfully and I continued my life. I was actually starting to be in a good place because I got rid of Alex and moved AGAIN away from the bed bugs, and, I was pretty proud of myself for not texting Jake. I wanted to turn a new leaf. I wanted to stop being so angry and blame everyone else for my problems. So a couple months later my bff told me Jake is coming for a visit and if I'd be interested in going to a party. I was like sure why not! I even thought enough time had passed that I can text Jake and not go nuts. So I did and we had a fun conversation via text. He was excited I was going to come to the party and so was I.

I ended up driving to the party (and didn't have anything to drink so I can drive home since I'd have nowhere to stay) I saw Jake and my insides just felt mushy and warm. When I see Jake, I just feel safe... He feels like home to me. He came up to me with a huge smile and gave me a big hug and we spent about 70% of the party together. When it was time for me to go, he hinted that I can stay and spend the night at his place so I can drink. I felt really like... Self strong and said maybe another time and the left. I drove home feeling great. Jake and I made plans to meet up for lunch a couple days later. He brings me up to his Mom's and the look on her face and her boyfriends melted my heart. They were so happy to see me. We sat and drank wine and laughed all night. That night I stayed over and Jake and I had sex. Then I stayed over for most of his visit. It was so amazing and fun. I felt like we reconnected and rekindled our love and he was giving me vibes as if he did feel that way. 

Then, he leaves to go back out West. I actually drove him to the airport and we both had a good cry saying goodbye. I can't tell you how many times Jake and I have had to say goodbye to say each other whether he leaves for home or I leave for home... It has to be about 8 times now we had to say goodbye at an airport or bus station. And each time never got easier. 

So he goes back. I'm probably 28 by this point (2018) just to keep the timeline solid. I tried my best to stay cool and not go back to being psycho over text. It was so hard because it felt like anytime he went back out west... He turned into a different person. He turns into this douchebro who tries to get as many tinder dates in a week as possible. He would add and like girls to Instagram constantly. It really drove me crazy but I remained calm and tried my best to chit chat as friends. I actually went to go ""visit my BFF"" out west a couple months later and just happened to go spend a few nights with Jake since ""I'm here anyway why not"" (I spent 80% of my trip with my bff which IS the reason I went) but again, we had an awesome, relaxing time. I tried to not bring up us but I couldn't help it. He basically would tell me he has an ""amazing"" time with me, but nothing has changed and he doesn't want a girlfriend right now. I would ask about the future and he would say bullshit that insinuates that us could be a possibility in the future which would keep me begging for more. 

Anyway, during my trip, he reveals to me his Mom has breast cancer. We both cried together. It devastating to hear. This woman treated me like I was her daughter. She meant a lot to me. But we stayed positive because we were certain she can beat it. 

So that year I spent Christmas with them again (a couple months after my trip). I didn't spent Christmas with them the last year actually... Since I was with Alex. But the years prior to that I did. So I basically missed one Christmas out of 4 or 5 and now I am back again and again his family couldn't be happier. We had a magical time. We talked about her breast cancer and tears went around the room. I tried to talk about us to Jake but he gave me the same spiel every single time. Anytime he'd insinuate that we will never be a couple, he'd see how hurt I looked and quickly backtracked and would say ""well, you just need to relax and be more calm. Because I don't know what the future holds. All I know is that I love spending time with you. It's complicated. I don't know"" 

So, I drive him to the airport after new years and off he goes again. 

So this is beginning of 2019 and let's just say I of course wasn't calm. I asked him if he really felt like we had a future to just throw me a bone every now and again. I'm not asking him to MOVE HOME NOW AND MARRY ME, but I needed some sort of security that he means what he says and that I'm not sitting here waiting while he's out banging chicks - granted, he would say dont wait for him... But would keep giving me mixed signals. He never said ""we are never going to be together"" he always kept my hopes up, even if it was on a little tiny strand of hair, he gave me hope. 

After many break downs, I just couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't sit there and remain cool calm and collect while he's doing whatever he wants out west. I couldn't sit there thinking one day we'll be together if I just sit here like a good girl and not annoy him. We had many fights via text until I finally said fuck it. We cant be friends. We just couldn't. My out of control emotions wouldn't let it. He also blocked me from Instagram so I wouldn't see all these chicks he was adding. I knew we were done. It was such a strange and soul crushing realization. I think the neighbours heard me cry all night. It was fucked. I never cried like that before since my Mom died. 

So a couple months later I got a sweet iob I loved. It was in parking bylaw and I loved it. I loved being out in the public walking about, getting in shape, giving attitude to idiot citizens breaking the law... It was good shit. And anytime Jake's Mom would need to go to a specific hospital that was under my route, I'd never ticket her car haha. Then sometime around May I rekindled a friendship with someone who I had known for 10 years, Ben. We hung out many times, reminiscing about college days etc. We then became boyfriend and girlfriend. I'm not sure if it was to fill a void in my heart knowing Jake and I would never be together, or if I really did have feelings... Either way I knew I had to move on. It was going to kill me I didn't. I felt my soul is diminishing day by day. Half of who I am died with my Mom and it felt like the other half of me died when Jake refused to be with me... I just had to move on. I was, again, for the second time moving on and trying to heal. My life was turning out to be not bad again. I had a fun job, and a nice boyfriend and I slowly stopped contacting Jake again. 

Near the end of summer (August) Jake came for a visit again, and I went to the same party they have every year again. I decided to stop by for a quickly hello before I drive up to spend the weekend with Ben. I see Jake, and of course, my insides turn to mush. But I kept my cool, said hello and gave him a hug, and of course he'd sit beside me trying to chat. He knew I was seeing someone also. He asked why don't I stay and have a drink and I said was going to see my other friends and Ben. He said I should stay and crash at Matts (host of party) and I said no I had plans. I leave and he walks me to the door. Says his Mom would love to see me so I should stop by one night for coffee. Which I did. Because I also wanted to see his Mom and her bf (I should mention I have visited them in the past without Jake being there). I tell Ben what I'm doing of course and he's fine with it. So I go over, have coffee, converse, joking around and such. A couple hours later Jake and I would just hang out along and chat. I should mention now that I've caught Jake in lies in the past about if he's out dating and such. He's always lied and said he's not out actively dating, but after many more questions he admits he is. The lying is what upsets me. He then says things like do we have to talk about it and why can't we just enjoy this time together... Which would make me mad because he always seemed like he just wants his cake and eat too. He doesn't want to be inconvenienced by ""talking about us"" while still using me to make him happy? I don't know. Either way Jake and I say goodbye. He leaves back out West. 

In November, Jake's moms bf (I'll just call him Paul) had a surprise 60th birthday and Jake came back for that. He asked me if I wanted to come because his Mom would love for me to come. I go because I still love Jake's mom and Paul. Jake and I meet up for a drink beforehand, he tells me how his Mom isn't doing so well with the cancer. We talk about it. He said the chemo wasn't really responding well but the doctors have hope still. We then go to the party, Paul is totally surprised and it was a great night. I had a couple drinks as I was driving. Jake asked if I wanted to stay longer since our friends may be meeting up and I said I had better go. We say goodbye. He leaves out west. 

He's back for Christmas, but I of course spend Christmas with Ben. But I did go see Jake and his Mom and had dinner with them. They of course got me presents still. Jake's Moms condition wasn't really improving and we were all pretty worried. We still were trying to keep positive though. We had a great time at Christmas. Jake and I hung out alone as friends (Ben knows this and of the cancer and was cool with it. He knows how close I am to his family) we had a great time hanging out of course and I've been doing well with not bringing ""us"" up and being whine, again I was on the slow path to moving and healing and coming to terms that we'll never have a future together. Anyways, he leaves out west. 

Suddenly, near the end of February, Jake's moms health takes a wild turn and is given 3 months to live. Jake calls to tell me and it's a huge blow. I cry. This woman was the closest thing I had to a Mom. She could not leave too. Jake comes home and I basically volunteer to be at his beck and call. He was my rock when my Mom died, and now his is dying. I needed to be there for him and for me. Anytime he wanted to talk, we'd call. I'd go over as much as I can to see him. His Mom was in the hospital and was almost non verbal. They said it was totally okay I come and see her because I'm basically family (their words) so Jake and I go to the hospital where him and Paul and his sister have basically been living. It was heart breaking seeing her like that and I tried to fight tears. 

She passed away a few days later. I drove to Jake after work and we drove his sister home in silence. I let him talk (or not talk) whenever he wanted. I was basically just there anytime he needed me which felt like it was all the time. We had the funeral and Jake mentions me in his speech was really heart warming and I felt honored really. That day/night we all basically got drunk. I saw his dad for the first time in a while and I went with Jake to go hang out with his family at a pub. As I was playing darts with his sister, I could see Jake and his dad talking quietly while looking at me (they were smiling). After I asked what that was about and he playfully pretended he didn't know what I was talking about. 

During this dark time, I never once brought up ""us"" in ANY way. This was Jake's time to grieve. One night, I was having a beer with Jake and Paul and we are just shooting the shit. Jake gets up to the bathroom and Paul joked about how Jake and I should be together. We laughed and I said I tried for 3 years and I couldn't anymore. He gave me a bummed out ""I know I know"" response but we still had a laugh. Later I selfishly told Jake what Paul said just to see his reaction, he laughed and that was it. As I was about to leave, Jake kinda of stops of me and admits he had been ""thinking about us"". We both started crying. This is what I've been waiting to hear for 3 years. I couldn't believe it was happening. However, I gathered my strength and told him that this could be coming from a place of grief and to sleep on it. He gave me a huge hug where we stayed that way for a few minutes. I leave to go home. 

I see Jake a few more times after that until he eventually had to leave again for out West. 

And, here we are folks. To make a long story short. I tried. I tried to do what he wanted which was basically keep my mouth shut, not complain, not whine, not bring us up, not be dramatic and not put pressure on him while he goes back to dating around on tinder. I asked him to keep me in his thoughts because he seems that as soon as he goes back out west then he couldn't give a shit about me but he says the same thing every time, that he cares a lot about me, why can't we just be friends and see ""if it goes anywhere"" etc. Mixed signals all over the place. That he's confused. His feelings are complicated. And to me, it seemed like he wasn't grieving about his Mom, which I know i sound ignorant on my part since I know people grieve differently... But, he was seriously just back to the same old ""Out West Jake"". After a few solid weeks of this I went back to psycho mood (without the name calling. I got over that. By psycho I just mean sending him a long message at least once or twice a week about ""my feelings"" basically to the point where it annoys him. It's like I blackout. I know in my heart these messages are doing more harm than good) . I tried so hard not to. But i told him numerous times I couldn't do this, and that he's selfish, and I asked him to throw me a bone every now and again etc... He would always blame me for everything going South and that I need to keep my emotions intact. Which he's right. I know I have fucked this up by acting crazy, by not just ""being cool"" and ""letting him date girls"" and that I'm emotionally unstable.

That was basically last nights conversation. I can't help but hate myself and feel that if I just RELAXED and gave him space... That he'd come around... But I did that TWICE. Twice I was moving on and healing... and both times, he dragged me back down. I know his mom died, and I wish more than anything I was an emotionally stable enough person to be calm and be someone he needs... But after more than a week after he went back out west he didn't message me and I went nuts... And I'm not asking every morning noon and night he sends me a text but just anything he didn't. I was angry that after everything I did for him he just didn't think of me at all. I'm not hanging over his head all I did for him because that's cruel, I just wish he would remember on his own. 

Once again, for the 3rd time I have to swallow that jagged sharp pill that he REALLY doesn't want to be with me, again. I had to block his social media despite him readding me to Instagram. I have to do this again. And I'm well aware that I don't deserve Ben. He deserves someone better than me and I am considering breaking up with him because I feel so guilty and shitty. Jake and I never kissed or were sexually intimate whatsoever during this. In fact, some of the reason why we broke up to begin with was our lack of sexual intimacy, I was his first for everything. But I'm still an asshole, I know. He deserves better. 

I'm so lost and confused. I wish I respected myself enough to be like ""hey that's okay fuck that guy, you're still awesome"" and pick myself up and move on finally. I'm fucking 30 years old. I don't even have that sick bylaw job anymore. If I don't find the strength now to push forward then my life is a write off. I feel like going to bed and just not waking up, like my Mom. 

My fingers hurt, I'm going to end this here. Thanks anyone if you read this mess.

TLDR: I'm unable to find strength to move on and love myself. Not sure if this is a ""love yourself you deserve better"" scenario or a ""I fucked up. If I just gave him space then we'd be together. He deserves better"" scenario.",2020.0,5.0,30.0,12:09:44,victim,30
661,52,138,"My (30sM) mother (60sF) was scammed. She lied to my father (60sM) about it for months before he found out. Now their relationship is in tatters, how can I help them repair it?",3.0,gx4n9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gx4n9x/my_30sm_mother_60sf_was_scammed_she_lied_to_my/,13.0,1591392786.0,"My mother and father immigrated from China over 30 years ago. They've built a life in the US together and were generally happy with each other. Recently, she fell for the Chinese Embassy Scam (Google it) and lost a decent sum of money. It wasn't a life-altering amount, but it was significant. The problem was that she lied about it to my father for 9 months until he randomly found out while using her computer. She had contacted the proper authorities and tried to handle the situation herself, but kept the files on her desktop and he came across them.

Both my parents are very proud and somewhat stubborn, but once my father realized that my mother had 1) been scammed, 2) transferred a large sum of money without consulting him, 3) lied about it for months before he discovered it himself, he became enraged. He doesn't get physically violent, but he does have a temper and often yells. He's had issues with family in the past who have lied to him and now he feels like he's completely lost faith in my mom.

He says that he lived a happy life previously, but that illusion is shattered and he no longer feels like this relationship is worth anything. My mother is also a pretty stubborn person herself and has tried to explain to him her reasoning. When it became obvious that she was scammed, she tried to do everything in her power to get the money back, but unfortunately I don't think there's much hope. They've both worked their entire lives, so it's not like the money is one person's or another, but he trusted my Mom to handle all of the family's finances.

This first blew up about a month ago and I'm pretty sure my Dad is depressed right now and going through some wild mood swings. Sometimes he's feeling okay, other times he goes in circles and circles and says some very hurtful things to my mother, he can't sleep... I've suggested that he see a mental health professional, but at the same time I know that my parents need to communicate with each other better to recover their relationship.

My mom has been trying to apologize and move on with their lives as if nothing has happened, but this has made him even angrier. He feels like she needs to suffer from some sort of consequence and wonders why he's the one feeling insane while she was the one who royally messed up. At the same time, my mom suffered through a lot during the scam process, and I know she just wants to move on with her life.

At the same time, my father wants to talk to my mother's Aunt, the person who introduced them to each other and knows them the best. This horrifies my mother because it feels to her like he just wants to publicly shame her for making a mistake. But my father sees it as needing to talk to someone he respects. Honestly, my father doesn't have many friends, and other than myself he doesn't have anyone to discuss it with.

My dad's mental health is continuing to decline. He's having nightmares, he can't sleep, he still can't believe that my Mom would fall for a scam like that. He's trying to rationalize it and has come up with wild accusations of her stealing money from him because none of this makes sense to him. My mom on the other hand, has apologized repeatedly but really doesn't want to tell her family about how she was scammed. She says that during that time period, she was just so afraid and felt like a zombie, just going through what these fake ""police officers"" told her to do...

I'm trying my best to be understanding to both of them, but being caught in the middle has taken its toll on me as well. I just want them to love and support each other and work through this, but my father is an emotional wreck right now and my mother is putting up with constant yelling and verbal abuse. What can I do? They're halfway across the country, I'm trying to get my father to agree to speak with a professional therapist to talk things out, but being an Asian male he has little respect for mental health issues and doesn't feel comfortable talking about these private matters with a stranger.

How can they start rebuilding trust and what can I do to help?

TLDR: Mom was scammed out of money, lied about it, dad found out months after the fact. Their relationship is in tatters, how can they start rebuilding trust again and how can I help?",2020.0,6.0,6.0,03:18:06,victim,30

He stays in a really big house with his parents and sister and his grandparents live next door. 

At the end of a really great chat I said “you know I feel like I’ve really coped well with this quarantine” and he said “you really have I’m so proud of you. I feel like if I didn’t live in this big house and wasn’t surrounded by my big family I wouldn’t be coping.” And I was so stunned by this comment “does he think he’s better than me because I stay in an apartment” 

I have gone back and forth in my head about what he said and what it meant. I was in an abusive relationship, where I didn’t have boundaries and let him say mean things to me. Speak to me horribly, I knew I wasn’t happy with what he was to saying but for 4 years I pretended it was okay and until eventually I realized he was abusive and I need to get out. 

This dude is genuinely such a sweet heart, and now I’m wondering if this is a red flag that I shouldn’t ignore like I did before. Is this a red flag? Or am I overreacting?

I will do my best to keep it as brief as possible. My mother has been in an on-and-off relationship with this man since around 2013. He is dangerous, abusive, and disgusting. If you're familiar at all with how narcissists operate, he's done nearly every thing in the playbook you could imagine. This list is by no means exhaustive, merely some of his ""greatest hits"", if you will:

* Cheating on her, or otherwise being shady af on dating sites while in a relationship with her.
* Usually is un- or under-employed, and lives off of my mom's income which is not really great, so she's often struggling financially. 
* Gaslighting her constantly. He once smeared his dog's shit on the inside lining of her coat, and then tried to say she was ""crazy"" for thinking he would do something like that, and that she must have sat in it somewhere
* Tried to control how she eats, how she wears her hair, her fitness level, etc.
* On the numerous occasions she's tried to break up with him, harassing her in every way imaginable-- text, calls, e-mail, voicemail-- to either berate her, or try to wheedle her back into being with him. He once threatened to tell her boss she was bi-polar (true) to convince them she was unfit for work (untrue, but a gambit that is an effective threat. He knows that she was once ostracized and eventually had to leave a job because her co-workers found out she was bi-polar). 
* As a result of the above point, there was an on-and-off period of about 2 years in which my mom's phone number changed frequently to try to get away from this deluge. Somehow, he'd always find out and text/call her from SEVERAL different numbers to get to her again. He would fill up her VM box every. Single. Day. 
* Once managed to bypass the gate code for her complex to show up at her door and fight with her during a breakup,  and then shoved her through a doorway. This is the only time he's been physical with her, as far as I know. 
* Tried to isolate her from her family. He once threw a temper tantrum because she wanted to visit her kids for Christmas. We lived halfway around the country from her and she hadn't seen us in 3 years at that point. ""What about MY Christmas? You're gonna leave me all alone just so you can go see *your kids?*"" (Last part said in a sneering tone). She acquiesced and did not see us that Christmas. 
* Has tried to intimidate me, in person and over text, on two separate occasions, to gain access to my mother when they were broken up. The second time was about 3 years ago, after which I decided I was done with him and have steadfastly refused to see him/speak to him since. 
* My brother (29M) and his gf (30F) moved to the state they're residing in, and for a while were living with them while they looked for their own place. Soon after they moved out, my mom broke up with him again. In an attempt to hurt her, I'm sure, **he claimed that my brother's gf had given him a blowjob!** It was a truly disgusting thing to say, and it was a sign of how effectively he's trapped her in his mind games that she both logically knew it to be untrue, but still had lingering doubts. 

My mom broke up with him after that last bullet point, as she was initially disgusted too. Over the years and many breakups, we've discussed narcissists/NPD at length and how to break the abuse cycle. These hours-long conversations were not easy for me. I have my own trauma from a narcissistic partner, who I luckily no longer have to deal with, but I was still dredging up and reliving those painful experiences because I understand how scary, confusing, and tough trying to get away from an abuser can be. It seemed like she really understood, and agreed that he was clearly a sick individual. She made a clean break of it, and he even moved away, back to his home state to leech off of his sister in lieu of my mother. Then, one day six months later, it became apparent that she'd gotten back together with him AGAIN. To put it lightly, I was upset and disappointed. We ended up having a huge fight over it, after which we decided it was for the best that we just never speak of him at all, as it was too painful for me to keep reliving the cycle right alongside her. That was over a year ago, and we've held to that decision ever since.

This was all fine until a few days ago, when my boyfriend's mom (Who at some point became FB friends with mine) texted him, asking ""how I felt about my mom getting engaged."" I went to check her FB, and yup, she got engaged. I spoke to her literally the day before this announcement, and she didn't mention this at all?! I honestly think she's avoiding talking about it with me, for obvious reasons. And I don't know how to feel, or process any of this. I don't even know how to begin to broach the subject with my mom. My family, for lots of reasons, is just a heapin' hot mess even in the best of times, so I feel my ability to gauge how I ""should"" respond to the crazy shit like this is kinda...hampered by that, I guess? All I know is that I will not be attending the wedding, as I want to continue never being in the same room as this man for the rest of my life. And that, at the root of it, I feel deeply insulted. As a side-note, I was actually in a somewhat similar situation with my narcissist ex where he crossed the line into hurting my family. Something about the damage not being limited to just me was so offensive that it finally opened my eyes to realizing I could never go back to him.  Just like me, my mom is fully aware that her bf has done awful things not just to her, but to her family. And yet, she's choosing him, in a move that will surely put even more friction between all of us. So...is it time to go no-contact with my mom? How do I talk to her about this? What would you do in the same situation?

664,55,143,I (23M) moved out of home after my mum (62F) verbally abused my girlfriend (21F),12.0,gqu15g,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gqu15g/i_23m_moved_out_of_home_after_my_mum_62f_verbally/,20.0,1590515223.0,"This has been stewing in the back of my mind for the past month or so and now with a quiet night to myself I'd like to put it out there for any advice or personal experiences that anyone may be able to share.

I (23M) have lived at home with my parents for all of of my life. In 2016 my dad passed away very suddenly and unexpectedly, and up until early April of this year my mum (62F) and I continued to live together in our family home. We didn't always see eye-to-eye, but we've always been relatively close. When my dad passed away we both had different ways of dealing with it; where she had the family gather around her and focused on her own passions I preferred the company of friends and to spend a fair share of my time alone. Although we were both getting used to the new family dynamic of a household of two and changes to our everyday home lives we somehow slowly drifted apart from each other, no longer being as close as we once were.

In July last year I met my girlfriend (F21) and after quickly becoming very close my mum and I discussed her coming to live with us as her own at-home family dynamic always sort of left her as the odd one out. In February of this year she moved in and all seemed to be going well with her getting on well with my mum, her feeling more comfortable in a different household dynamic, and overall helping to make the home feel a little more lively again. Within a month however issues started to arise with my mum and girlfriend both being from very different family backgrounds and having quite different personalities. My mum has always been very particular about our family home as she made it into what it is with my dad, and where she is always very tidy and clean my girlfriend is a little more relaxed and somewhat forgetful; often leaving drawers or the fridge open by accident and taking a few days to pick up her dirty clothes from the bedroom floor. Where my girlfriend is very casual about humour and her family often likes to make harmless fun of each other my mum is not good at taking a joke and is offended very easily. The only things that I feel that my mum and girlfriend have in common beyond their interests are that they are both quite sensitive and rather stubborn.

By early April and well into our country's lock-down for Covid-19 we were all having issues within the household dynamic:

My mum was always having mood swings and would go from being totally fine one minute to being in the most foul mood the next. She would always be pulling me aside to voice her grievances against my girlfriend ranging from complaining that she was lazy, careless and rude to accusing her of trying to push my mum out of my life, wanting to take over and redecorate her home, and talking about her behind her back. I would try to explain things to my mum like how my girlfriend has always been forgetful ever since being on medication for depression and that her jokes aren't snarky stabs at her, rather that she is from a family where that is the norm. I never brushed away my mum's concerns, but I would remind her that my girlfriend's actions and behaviors aren't intentional but rather the result of how she was brought up and what she is used to at home.

My girlfriend on the other hand was growing increasingly anxious living with my mum and I; she was always on-edge waiting for my mum to have another angry outburst and often felt like she had to tip-toe around everywhere to not upset my mum. She would often have anxiety attacks at night where she would cry for hours on end and would often talk to me about her concerns with my mum's behavior - towards me in particular, and how she would like us to look into moving into a place of our own. Something to note is that my girlfriend doesn't have any friends of her own, outside of work my mum and myself were her only source of interaction - with the further exclusion of her work once the lock-down started.

As for myself I was just having a hard time trying to keep both my mum and my girlfriend happy, I would often feel caught in the middle trying to hold things together and would increasingly often just try to find relief by playing video games with my friends online. I hated the way that my mum and girlfriend couldn't get along and worst of all this caused me to start doubting my feelings and future with my girlfriend as as they say ""your mum knows best"". 

After a while though I started to feel more and more that my mum's behavior was the cause of the tension within the house. Her mood swings would become ridiculous with me seriously wondering if she was bipolar. She would walk around the house slamming cupboards and snapping back at me with the most awful tone, and when my mood would begin to reflect hers she would act totally normal and ask why I was in a bad mood and say that I had no reason to be annoyed with her. If my girlfriend and I gave each other a hug and my mum saw it she would accuse me of being inconsiderate, and if caught hugging or doing anything remotely affectionate in our own room with each other she would stomp in and pull the door closed with a slam. However at the same time if we were in our bedroom with the door closed to have some time to ourselves she would later complain that we 'shut ourselves away' and question why we were even living there if we didn't want to interact with her. 

Even I can see that this behavior likely stems from the emotional pain of seeing my girlfriend and I in a budding relationship while she is still mourning the loss of her own, but her moods went even beyond this. If I came home after a horrible day at work and in a bad mood and was short with someone my mum would call me out for taking out my frustrations on others, I would recognize this, quickly apologize and take some time to unwind. If my mum came home after a horrible day at work and in a bad mood and was short with someone if I made a comment about it I would be met with total hostility, told that how dare I judge her in her own home, and that if I didn't like it we could move out. My mum would hold grudges and be in moods for days, and when she did finally come around she would never apologize for her actions or attitude. Perhaps one of the biggest things too is that she is never able to be wrong, and I mean never. Even while growing up during arguments with her my dad would tell me to just accept that it was my fault and apologize, not because I was wrong (although obviously sometimes I was), but because ""she can't be wrong and she won't accept that she is"". 

There is so much more that I wish I could add but this post has grown so long already. One thing I will add though was how often she would bring up how my girlfriend and I could move out, every single time she was in a mood or started an argument she would say ""you two don't choose to live here, I *allow* you to live here"", or ""you two don't have to live here, you can quite easily move out"". Often as arguments would calm down she would change to ""believe it or not I actually like you two living here, but if you two want to move out that's up to you"". My mum has always known that the idea of moving out has terrified me, and I feel like that's why she brought it up so often.

So this brings us to about a month and a half ago, mid-lock-down, one night my mum comes into our room while my girlfriend is in the bathroom and gives me the ultimatum that I need to ask her to move out within the next three days otherwise she'll ask her herself and ""in front of me"". I told my girlfriend about it immediately and we decided that as soon as the lock-down was over that we'd both go flatting together instead - which is something that we had already been considering for weeks. The next day I had volunteered to help a local businessman cut firewood for his landscaping company (while adhering to lock-down work protocols, of course) and when I got home I could already see that things were tense with my mum in a matter-of-fact mood and my girlfriend doing her best to be calm and collected. Comments were made about me earning money and how I still needed to pay some money back to my mum for some expenses that she had helped me with while I wasn't working (we're talking about a couple of thousand) and I made the comment about how I wouldn't be able to pay her back as much as I had been (one third of my paycheck each week) once we go flatting as we'd have other expenses too like rent and groceries.

*and     shit     hit     the     fan*

What ensued was an absolutely horrible evening. My mum let rip but almost entirely at my girlfriend making comments such as ""you are the nastiest bitch I have ever met"" and that ""I hope my son meets a really nice girl one day who isn't you because I don't want you as a daughter in-law"". My girlfriend decided that she had had enough and was moving back to her parents's house immediately, as did I, and we instantly began packing up everything we owned. For the next couple of hours we loaded our cars, all the while my mum harassed us asking for our house keys and telling us to hurry up and get out of her house. At some points she wouldn't allow my girlfriend back into the house and instead threw her belongings out onto the brick path, she yelled in my girlfriend's face and at one point my girlfriend yelled back, and when my girlfriend finally broke down in tears my mum said to her face with a mocking tone ""aw is wittle \[girlfriend's name\] gonna cry now?"". Throughout this whole thing I amazingly managed to stay relatively calm, but I'm not going to lie that it took a lot for me to not go through that house like a fucking tornado. After a few hours we managed to get 80% of our things out and with the help of my girlfriend's dad we got it all back to their house. Her parents were nice enough to take us in and we've been staying with them ever since while we wait for the flat that we are going to move in to become available. 

In the time since then I haven't spoken to my mum all that much, I've been back to the house a couple of times to collect more things and the atmosphere has been a bit like that between strangers. She contacts me like nothing has happened whenever she needs something and one time when I called her to ask for advice about car insurance she was rather nasty about it and made the comment ""well it's real nice that that's all that you called to talk about and didn't even wish me a happy mother's day"" and hung up, even though it was over a week before mother's day. She's also made contact with me a number of times to talk about a repayment scheme that she's writing up with her lawyer to have me pay back everything she's ever paid for me over the past four years and with interest even though a legally binding agreement was never formed, and we are now looking at tens of thousands rather than just thousands.

And that's pretty much where it stands. I'm angry and I'm upset because I don't understand how things with my mum have gotten this way, with my dad the three of us were the most incredibly close family and now he's gone and things are like this. I'm angry at her for how she's behaved, and I'm absolutely appalled at the things that she said to my girlfriend - no one should speak to anyone like that, and definitely not a 62 year-old who's welcomed their son's 21 year-old girlfriend into their home. I don't want anything to do with her for a good while to come, and even though that's my decision it upsets me. It's her birthday on Thursday and although I don't want to do anything a part of me says that I should.

I appreciate anyone who has taken the time to read this absolute novel, I've been bottling this for well over a month and sometimes you just need to blast the shit for the world to read. Does anyone have any advice or personal lessons to share from similar experiences? 

tl;dr - My mum and I invited my girlfriend to live with us and after the new household dynamic didn't work out with my mum's mood swings and nasty behavior she verbally abused my girlfriend and threw her things onto the footpath so we moved out.

My dad kicked me out when I was 18 because his new wife didn’t like me and he and my brother haven’t talked to me since. I moved in with my grandparents because my mom became super emotionally abusive towards me once i entered high school. She had been a good mom up until then so I have no idea what set her off. My dad had been a decent dad up until then too. Maybe a little distant, but no one ever thought he would kick me out and never talk to me again. I think he’s just a push over- my mom was for sure more “in charge” in the relationship and he has mom/dad issues so I think he just does whatever his new wife wants.

Anyway, growing up I HATED my brother since I could remember. Everything he did annoyed me or grossed me out. From what I remember it wasn’t like I just hated him sometimes but for the most part loved him. I don’t ever remember liking him. I feel so guilty it makes me sick. He was soooo sweet to me. He loved me to death. I remember one time I spent two weeks away at my aunt in San Francisco’s house and when I returned he had bought me a nice shirt as a welcome home gift. I came home and it was sitting on my bed in a box and he was so excited to give it to me. I didn’t even say thank you. I hate myself for how I treated him. I feel like i must be a bad person deep down or something is missing. How could I hate someone who was so nice to me? Our family really was ok up until high school and I loved my mom and dad and felt loved by them. I’d love to use the excuse that I was taking my anger out on him, but I can’t because I don’t think I had any reason to be angry.

He lives in another state now very far away. People don’t quite believe me when I say there’s no way for me to contact him to say sorry so please don’t suggest that. I’ve tried. I guess I just want to know if anyone else ever felt like this towards their sibling for no good reason or if I’m really just a messed up person.

My family never really mentioned him, but as I got older I pieced together information from a lot of different family members.

My mother was 18 when she met my bio dad who was 28, he had been involved in gang activities, sold drugs, and was an all around unpleasant person. My mum didn’t put his name on my birth certificate at the time as their relationship fell out. My family wanted to give him an opportunity to have a relationship with me, so allowed him supervised visitation. Each time this occurred, my grandparents would supervise and my mum would stay in a seperate room. He would hold me for a few moments, then ask to see my mum with little interest in me.

The timeline of the following incidents are a little unclear, but my mother had hesitations on my bio dad due to his character, he was emotionally abusive towards her, he had gotten my grandad fired with false terrorism claims, and generally wreaked havoc for everyone. My family moved states, but my mum secretly gave him a letter telling him we moved in fear of getting in trouble for not notifying him. A social worker tried to track him down for child support but he did a good job of avoiding it. Eventually he arrived at the house and kept demanding to see my mother.

She seeked legal help who more or less told her that there were ways it could be made difficult for him to be involved in my life, ie court - but if he requests a dna test we would essentially be tied to him. So she decided to tell him that I was not his child, but a result of a German tourist. 

He left after this. However he didn’t seem to believe the claims as he proceeded to try and contact my family several times and reach me between when I was 2-15. At this point my grandparents took control as my main carers from when I was 8 months old. He would email my grandfather’s colleagues and say he’d worked with my grandad before and wanted his contact information. My grandad ignored any contact and I never found out about it until I was 18.

Fast forward to now, I decided I wanted to speak with him for closure. I’d always been curious as to what he looked like, if i look like him, and if I had any medical history to be concerned about. I did a DNA test and got in contact with his sister who knew about me and spoke with him.

I spoke with him and heard his side of the story. He claimed my grandparents had destroyed his life, he sunk into depression, he’d always thought of me, and will always be my ‘dad’ and love me. He showed me photos he kept from when I was a baby and introduced me to his wife and children. He mostly focused on himself, his hard childhood, how my family ‘destroyed’ him. But never mentioned any error he made or apologised for anything he had done. I asked him everything I wanted to ask and at the end, he said he would like to continue speaking with me. I let him know i would think about it, as it wasn’t something I had intended on doing.

I asked him if he had any questions for me (i had only told him my grandparents raised me, i went to private schools, study finance and am engaged), he told me he didn’t have any questions about me. I found this strange, if I had an estranged child I would want to know every detail I missed, but I digress. 

I finally sent a message to him telling him I’m willing to develop a relationship and put the past behind us. I had hopes that he might be a different person than he was 20-odd years ago. He responded by saying that he couldn’t have a relationship with me until the past was addressed, he went on to say my grandparents ‘lied’ to me my whole life, my mum took advantage of his ‘good heart and nature’ and nearly destroyed him. He asked me “doesnt it bother you they did this to me? arent you angry or upset with them?”

Now this pissed me right off. I hadn’t given him any indication of what I knew, but I love my family, and I know they gave him an opportunity to do the right thing. Every discussion I’ve with him up to this point was always about him, how he was hurt, how he suffered, with no question or concern about his daughter who’s 22 years has been a mystery. I get a sense of narcissistic personality disorder from him (but im no psychologist)

So i have a decision to make, and I would like insight from someone who isn’t as close to the situation for some objective opinions. 

Do I attempt to develop a relationship with him, or do I cut ties? What do you think, Reddit? 

TLDR; my dad finally came back after going to the servo to buy a pack of cigarettes 22 years ago and taking the wrong plane, he’s kind of terrible, do i continue talking to him?",2020.0,5.0,7.0,17:08:47,victim,18

Just my personal opinion about myself, I'm not  trying to apply that line of reasoning to anyone else. My first partner  wasn't outright abusive but he was an alcoholic and didn't like me  having friends.  My second one strung me along and manipulated me, but  again I don't think it was to the point of the relationship being  abusive.

I'm preparing to move in  with the guy I've been dating for a few months (it was my idea) and  everything so far has been like a dream. He's perfect - he's very kind  and caring and respectful. We communicate extremely well and he's never  given me any reason to doubt him. He never gets mad at me and does a lot to make me happy. But I'm worried that he's too good to  be true and that I might be overlooking some things. I'm also worried  that he might be manipulating me into believing that he's such a good  person, and might start to change in the future. I'm living thousands of  miles away from all of my family and friends at the moment due to work  so I want to be extra cautious. I know that people who end up in bad  abusive relationships often say that their partner so great at first and  then changed gradually, and I want to know what to look out for.

I  was groomed and manipulated for most of my childhood so lots of things  that might be obvious to others could just seem like normal behavior to  me.

TL;DR - what specific  behavioral changes could be red flags? What do I need to watch out for?  Is it possible to know if you're being manipulated, and if so how?

I'm ruining my life and I know it and I can't seem to stop.

&#x200B;

We've been together for 7 years. He's horrible. I know this without a doubt. He's a liar, manipulative, a blame-shifter, financially irresponsible, abusive and a serial cheater. He's also incredibly charming and funny and everyone (who doesn't really know him) just loves him. His social media is basically his (large) fan-club.

&#x200B;

I'm a good person and a good partner. I'm honest, kind, loving and loyal. I'm also clearly co-dependent. I don't lie to him or cheat on him or sneak around. I'm always there for him and have put up with so much. I always look after things with regards to his family (picking up groceries for his elderly parents, getting birthday cards for his family members, sending his mom flowers, etc etc). Even when he's been physically abusive, I've never called the cops. He had a full-on affair (and lied through his teeth about it) and when I found out I finally got the strength to move out.

&#x200B;

But I didn't cut ties. I tried to, but I missed him so much and I stayed in contact with him, arguing endlessly, trying to make him understand how badly he had hurt me, etc. Of course we soon got back together, but things have never been good after that. I still can't have sex with him and I'm still so hurt (and it's been many months). 

&#x200B;

But I can't walk away.

&#x200B;

Everyone tells me to run. All my friends, my sister, my mom, even HIS sister tell me he's not a good guy and I need to get away from him. Even my ex-husband (short marriage in my 20s, still friends) begs me to get away from him. That he's stealing years of my life. That he'll never change. That I've given him chance after chance and he doesn't give a fuck and continues to make the same ""mistakes"". And then blame me. He had an affair with a co-worker when we first got together (but lied about it for several years). He came onto MY co-worker, totally embarrassing me. He has contacted many women on facebook inappropriately. He had another affair with someone from facebook (which is when I moved out).

&#x200B;

You'd think now he'd be on good behavior? No. Not at all. Instead he's just pissed off that I won't agree to move back in yet. And he taunts me that if I won't move in he's going to ask a woman (who clearly has liked him for a long time) on a date.

&#x200B;

A normal person would tell him to jump in the lake. I can't. My heart shatters and I imagine him with this other woman (he's also mad that I still won't have sex with him and he tells me he's so horny and will just get it from her if I don't move back and start sleeping with him). 

&#x200B;

It's been 7 years of hellish behavior. And yet I still want him. I don't know how to break free without my heart absolutely breaking. When I tried last time I was so depressed I didn't want to be alive. Nobody can figure out WHY I want someone who is so horrible to me and treats me with no respect. I don't know either. Please help me. Any ideas how to break this bond from hell?

How do I tell my sister I'm not in her life because of this?",23.0,gclsxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gclsxi/my_30f_13yearold_sister_now_has_social_mediaa/,31.0,1588515380.0,"My mother and half sister now live in Utah. I live in Los Angeles. My mother is undiagnosed BPD and narcissism, and has absolutely wreaked havoc on my life and others. Those who aren't ""affected"" by her are the ones who choose to ignore her behavior/agree with the behavior/pretend its not there, possibly as some sort of survival instinct because if anyone disagrees, she will unleash an anger that is just insane. I've had to distance myself from that entire side of the family because they all seem to avoid and have classic Stockholm Syndrome when it comes to this.

Since I estranged myself from her in 2013 it's like I'm this weird Voldemort in their lives that's never talked about, or if it is, I'm sure she uses it as a way to get attention and pity that her own daughter ""rejected"" her. At a young age I understood that it was abuse and would stand up to her and try to  reach out to my family to ask for help and support, but it never came since they all seem to be in deep denial. When I've gotten family members to snap out of it temporarily and come close to seeing my POV, it's like their memories are wiped and nothing changes the next day. So I'm forced to step away.

She'd always use my now-13-year-old half sister Kara as a tool for manipulation and shame, and now that Kara has a phone, she uses her phone to pretend to be Kara, or coaches Kara into sending a text that instigates a reaction from me (she did to me when I was Kara's age, so I know exactly what's going on). On my birthday yesterday, the exact text was ""Hi, \_\_\_\_! Happy birthday!!! It feels like forever since I've seen you, I hope we can see each other one day!"" If I respond, it instigates unwanted communication that won't stop, and if I ignore it, I'm a horrible person. I'm confident that my mother will never stop doing this.

Almost every time Kara has reached out, it's very clearly been my mother either coaching her what to say to me to instigate something, or it's my mother using her phone, pretending to be Kara. When I was Kara's age, my mom stalked my stepfather's ex wife online and used me as a tool to help her do it without me realizing what I was doing, so I'm confident this is a similar creepy thing going on. It's tough because it's something I can't call out since I can't 100% prove it, and it'd also look like I'd be ""bringing Kara into it.""  I'm so uncomfortable.

Kara really needs to understand what's going on so she doesn't think any of this is her fault because she's starting to follow my experience as a kid. That conversation can't really come from me because it will likely create mass confusion for Kara. It sure as hell won't be coming from anyone in the family, so I have no idea what to do. My stepfather (and Kara's dad) is a classic avoidant and refuses to help after I've thoroughly explained how important having this discussion. He said he understood, yet he won't fucking do it. No one will. No one wants to put in the work and take responsibility to have a hard conversation because it will also make them face their own guilt in knowing they contributed to my abuse by avoiding that too. They are cowards.

Kara needs to understand the situation, but I don't think she'd accept that her mother is the monster she is, so it might cause even more confusion for her to be told. Her mother is still her hero right now and has a firm grasp on her. If I'm in contact with Kara she will instantly share it with my mother, who will see it as a perfect excuse to message me and start her insane BPD narcissistic abusive behavior that wreaked havoc on my life. My demands of no contact will go ignored. In the last year my mom has decided to send me random heart emoji's every few months for no reason just to taunt me into saying ""don't text me,"" which would give her the excuse to unleash the whole abusive cycle. Any response only fuels people like her, so I ignore it. But being in contact with Kara will create more of that and she'll find a way to contact me even when I block her number. It's a direct detriment to my life and well being.

I don't know what I can even do or say when she's surrounded by my mother 24/7, and surrounded by family who clearly will not have my back or support anything I say as a way to avoid confronting their own internal demons. Kara's now added me on Facebook and just started an Instagram, so it's clear she wants to connect and she will only get more confused.

How do I deal with this?

670,61,151,My (M28) BF (M34) of a year recently came out to me as sex averse and I'm honestly having a hard time adjusting as we are constantly renegotiating boundaries. I would appreciate any advice.,3.0,gwl3cq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gwl3cq/my_m28_bf_m34_of_a_year_recently_came_out_to_me/,7.0,1591317920.0,"Just to get this out of the way because I know it's going to be important for anyone who wants to reply but sex isn't a deal breaker for me. I like it, I have a pretty moderate sex drive, but really for me its just one aspect of physical intimacy and actual sex is so far down on the totem pole that I'm willing to overlook it. That being said, this switch in my relationship and what feels like a constant renegotiating of boundaries is starting to drain me and test my patience and confidence.

When ""David"" and I first got together things were what I would expect in terms of a new relationship. We moved slowly but there was tension, there was flirtatious texting, there were pictures back and forth. We both lead busy lives but when we had private intimate moments together they were electric. It was clear he had a libido lower than mine but like I said sex wasn't really a priority for me and we had what felt like good physical chemistry regardless so it was a complete none issue.

Shortly into our official relationship things started to shift. He would stop responding to flirtatious texts or pictures positively. After noticing it becoming more of a trend I asked what was going on and if things were okay. He affirmed things were okay but he truthfully wasn't into anything too flirty or sexy over text because it made him feel a little silly and he much preferred to do it in person. Okay, no worries, new relationship energy doesn't last forever and texting flirtatious things all the time probably falls into that category. So obviously I stopped texting that sort of thing , and kept it cute or supportive or just day to day stuff.

Things continued pretty normally for awhile but then I notice he didn't really care for my in person flirting either. There would be, at times, a quick flash of hesitance on his face, which over time became painfully obvious looks of disgust. I would ask him what was wrong but he assure me everything was fine and that he was just tired or he was just adjusting to having a boyfriend around. But it continued and after awhile he would ""playfully"" assert that I was being gross or weird if I made any sexual commentary.

It was confusing... to me. He would tell me a lot of stories about his past sexual encounters (just in passing, not with great detail) and he would tell me a lot of stories about how horny he always was. In every other aspect of our relationship things were great. We did things together, we had similar hobbies, we supported each other through some difficult work transitions, and shared so many deeply personal and romantic moments. Honestly 10/10 relationship. I had no reason not to believe what he was saying at this point.

Things came to a head though at the beginning of social distancing. Our state banned all none essential travel so we decided to move in together for the time being. It became very obvious very quickly that he had been misleading me in some way. We had maybe one brief sexual encounter in what was about three weeks.

One night we had an argument where he shared a story about being so horny he had to jack off three times at work in the bathroom. I was visibly uncomfortable and he asked me what was wrong. I had reached a point of frustration where I was like ""Okay, I'm starting to feel insecure, you're telling me all these stories about your sexuality but you seem completely uninterested in touching me so whats going on."" He got very defensive and asserted he shouldn't have to explain his masturbation to me (it was kind of implied I was being immature(because i'm younger) for even bringing it up) and that I can't just sit on the couch and pout. He stormed out of the room but I followed and I demanded him to tell me what was happening.

At this point he ""confessed"" that he had little to no physical sensation in his genitalia and sex just wasn't a thing for him and he was afraid that it would be a deal breaker for me. He said he enjoyed it at times but there was just no drive for him to pursue it and he would be happy to partake sometimes with me, I just shouldn't expect it all the time. When he jacks off its mostly just for the release of endorphins and not really a sexual experience. Okay, great I wish I had known that to begin with so I wouldn't  have felt so rejected but now that I know things should be easier. I'm totally happy with the whole spectrum of sexual activity so don't feel the need to bust out your best performance every time.

Things were awkward for a little while, I honestly didn't feel super comfortable continuing the way things had been previously because I had felt mislead and I didn't like that he expected me to catch on without actually telling me. I lost a lot of confidence in what I was doing in the relationship. After awhile things kinda went back to normal. We didn't have frequent sex to begin with so I was really just keeping the sexual flirtation down to minimum. We were still having a great time together, we danced a lot and wrestled and kissed and it felt nice. We made a couple plans to have more intimate evenings but most of them fell to the wayside for one reason or another.

We had a night where we planned to shower together. He ended up getting high (to relax) and he almost passed out in the shower. It was frightening for me. The next day he further confessed that he's actually sex averse and that when he feels like the expectation for sex is there he begins to get incredibly anxious. He shared a few stories of abuse and trauma. He said that he was sorry, he was working on it in therapy, and he okay with pretty much everything up to direct sexual contact.

Its been about 2 weeks since then and honestly I feel so drained. He seems lighter and happier, he still does sweet things for me and my family, he always is trying to build me up. I'm happy with the relationship but I'm not at all happy with how this situation evolved.

I'm trying my best not to be resentful because I know that this was a struggle( and that is an understatement) for him to even get to this point but I feel like I'm paying the price for this. If he had told me this six months ago when we were started to disconnect on this I would have stayed with him happily but this trickle truth is damaging my mental health. It seems like he feels like since its all out in the open things should just be great now but my trust is damaged because regardless of intent and my feelings on the reality of what a relationship with David will look like, he mislead me. I still don't know what is okay to do physically because he doesn't quite know! How can i be confident in a relationship where the rules keep changing? I'm mad that he acted like I was overly insecure or immature when he was sending me all sorts of mixed messages.

Now he's more doting and more forward about our future together. He has apologized for putting me through his struggle and thanks me frequently for my patience and understanding. It almost feels like hes trying to negotiate with me like"" hey I wont be able to give you a crazy sex life , but I can give you this instead."" Which I would have jumped on if that was what was sold to me in the beginning! I'm doing my best to keep a brave face and be supportive.

It was always pretty obvious that I liked her and she would occasionally flirt with me, nothing to crazy just a friendly type of flirting.  A bit later she ended up moving about an hour away and we only saw one another a couple times a year, but we texted almost daily and would still talk about our lives. During that time, I broke up with my now ex-girlfriend because I had strong feelings for Liz and I felt like it wasn’t fair to my ex or myself for us to be in a relationship when I knew that I’d be willing to leave her for another girl. It kinda sucked and I still feel terrible about it, but I couldn’t help how I felt, and I still can’t, despite how hard I’ve tried.

So at a later point Liz and I hung out for the first time in months for her birthday and she was flirting with me way more than usual and in a less friends, more I wanna hump you, kinda way. Over the course of about 90 minutes she told me how great I was looking about three times, went in for a hug about 9 times, and not quick hugs, the long drawn out ones with a bit of a back massage thrown into it, and she even made a remark about us going to the hotel bar across the street but said we could do “something else” there since I don’t drink. Side note, that night is the only time in my life that I’ve ever completely lost my train of thought mid sentence and blurted out random sounds because of a girl. So at this point I was unsure if maybe she and her boyfriend had ended things and she was actually making a move, or not. So I  managed to figure out a bit later that they were in fact still together and I was left completely unsure of what she was doing.

A few months after that she hit me up to help her move because she had thrown her boyfriend out after he had gotten drunk and hit her. So I showed up and she insisted that we go get lunch together and told me the story about what happened and how bad their relationship had actually been. She told me that he had a drinking problem and regularly would verbally and physically abuse her, but she ended it when he did it in front of her family. 

Following her moving, she began inviting me to her house pretty much weekly and we began to get a bit closer. She’d always offer to let me stay the night on her couch as well but I’d always decline because of work. She eventually asked me when I had a 3 day weekend and changed around her work schedules to get the same days off and invited me to basically come spend the night and go do something together during the day. We had fun, but she seemed sad and distant a few times during the weekend. When I asked her why, she explained that she was still in love with her ex and felt guilty for leaving him to deal with his problems on his own. At the end of the weekend I told her I had to leave and she seemed pretty bummed out, but I left anyway. About 15 minutes later she misunderstood a text I sent her and seemed pretty excited when she thought I was coming back. I apologized because she misunderstood and she didn’t text me back for almost an hour, but when she did respond, it was a massive paragraph explaining how she’s not over her ex and will need a lot of time to heal, but she wanted us to keep hanging out as friends. I agreed with her and told her it was best to wait and heal as well.

Fast forward maybe a month and I’m at her house spending the night again and things are pretty normal. Then she invited me to come hangout in her room because she was getting really tired. So I went in and sat on her bed with her while we talked for a bit, but things kinda escalated pretty quickly. First she grabbed my rounded headphone case which was in my pocket and when I asked why she was grabbing my headphones, she said she thought it was something else. At this point she’s extremely drowsy and acting kinda incoherent, but she pushed me back on the bed and flung her hair on top of me while kinda putting her head up against me. At this point I’m really confused because she told me before that she wasn’t ready to be anything beyond just friends, but her actions are pointing towards wanting to do a little bit more than that. But I decided that I needed to do what I thought was right and just let her fall asleep without things going any further since she said she wasn’t ready. She ended up passing out with her body kinda wrapped around me, so I tried to move which slightly woke her up. In her incoherent state, she told me that she wanted me to move so I’d always be there for her and then passed out again. So I woke her up again so she was a bit more coherent and asked her about what she just said, she told me she did want me around but not to change my whole life around for her and then fell back asleep. I was honestly kinda in shock since I’d liked her for so long and what she had just said was one of the sweetest things anyone has said to me, so I just wrapped my arms around her and fell asleep holding her. 

We both woke up early the next morning and she asked me to go sleep on the couch so her family wouldn’t see that we had slept in the same bed and I just kinda nodded and went to the couch and we both went back to sleep. The next morning I asked her about the previous night and she asked if we had sex, I told her no and she said she didn’t really remember anything after us going into her room and waking up in bed together. So I said whatever and just let things keep going like normal.

A few weeks later we had a similar situation and she was incoherently trying to get into my pants again, and I once again didn’t do it, but I did decide that we needed to talk about it. I woke her up and told her flat out that I did have feelings for her, but I understood and agreed that she needed time to fully heal from her traumatic relationship. She told me that if the situation were different she would want to start a relationship with me and asked if I wanted to cut contact with her because of my feelings. I told her that I still wanted us to be friends and I wanted to be there for her whenever she needed me.

The next couple weeks things were a bit different and we didn’t talk much. But she eventually invited me to go see a movie with her family and things went back to normal. Unfortunately though, things got worse from that point on. She randomly showed up at my apartment one day and told me that her ex had contacted her and was in Alcoholics Anonymous trying to get his shit together and had asked to stay the night on her couch. She agreed and one thing led to another and they ended up sleeping together. She told me that she knew things were toxic between them and shouldn’t date him again, but she wanted to help him sort his life out as a friend. Then despite my advice, they slowly got back together over the next few weeks. That lead to him living with her and her fully supporting him since he can’t hold a job. 

Over the months since they got back together her and I started to hangout less and less often.  Things would go well between them and then he’d relapse and they’d fight and break up again. They’d break up and she would come to me and want me to hangout with her again. The whole time everyone who cares about her was trying to get her to completely cut off contact with him. This has been going on for about 10 months now with them having 4 big breakups. During 2 of them she called me and asked if I would make him leave since she was scared of him. Every time this happened he would get violent and break things like mirrors and windows, or break into her house if she locked him out. Luckily though he seems to be scared of me and has backed down whenever I confronted him during this. 

There has also been multiple times that Liz has still seriously flirted with me even while they were together and not fighting in any way. She has randomly showed up at my house and asked me to go hiking with her, and during the hike she   Insinuated that she’s got needs that I should take care off, then played it off as a joke after a few seconds when I didn’t respond. Another time she showed up to the restaurant I was working at and had a couple drinks before coming her and I hung out on my lunch break. While we sat in her car she tried to feed me some of the sushi she ordered and ended up spilling it on my shirt, so she leaned over and just licked it right off my chest, then when said she needed to go she stared at me for a few seconds and told me she should stick her tongue down my throat. She then promptly left. Over the course of the past year she’s also brought up my penis and offhandedly asked me how big it was around 5 different times, though I just laughed at it and treated as a joke every time. A few times she’s also brought up that she thinks my body is attractive and how she finds it sexy that I’m in such good shape.  She’s also repeatedly asked me about my sex life regularly calls me a hoe because I was sleeping with my old roommate (21F) occasionally since we were both single and had dated shortly. She’s also always been passive aggressive towards my roommate and would always make comments about her.  

On top of the flirting she’s also told me multiple lies to make it seem like her and her boyfriend aren’t that close. Most of the time he’s been living with her, she tells me that he isn’t and makes an effort to keep me from knowing he’s there. I’ve always been good at picking up on clues and seeing through lies though, so I’ve confronted her a few times about it and she’s denied that he was living there, despite the evidence I provided and the fact that her family was posting videos on social media the whole time that had her boyfriend in the background at their house. She also would tell me smaller lies about them not hanging out and saying she was out with different friends when she was with him. About a week ago she also tried to tell me that they haven’t had sex in 4 months which I don’t believe.

Recently though things have gotten significantly more complicated, I needed to move  a lot closer to where she lives for work that I’m supposed to be starting when this whole pandemic ends and she told me I should move in with her because her family members are no longer living with her. I told her that it probably wasn’t a good idea for me and her boyfriend to live in the same house since we both clearly hate each other and have gotten pretty close to engaging in fisticuffs multiple times. She told me he’s gonna be leaving and moving into his own place since he’s working now and that her and I could go find a new place together as well. I wasn’t quite sure about all of it, but I agreed to move into a new apartment with her once I was working. So then she started going back and forth and I wasn’t sure what to do. One day she’d say I should move whenever we can find a place and I’m working, the next day she’d be freaking out and telling me she need me to move into her current house right away. She also regularly got pretty upset and wouldn’t tell me what was bothering her. During all of this her and I were talking over text and the situation with her boyfriend came up, she ended up stating that it was my fault she was with him. I asked how it was my fault and she said it was because I didn’t show her enough love, affection, and attention. I honestly couldn’t tell if she was saying it as a joke over text, but I kinda feel like she was being pretty serious. She also told me she was upset about us not hanging out for almost 2 months during the pandemic. And when I brought up that I had offered to hangout, she  said she was busy with other friends that day, then she called me stupid for never just showing up at her house and taking her to go do something like those friends had done.

So fast forward to a little over a week ago and she demanded that I needed to move in right away, despite the fact that her boyfriend has not left yet and I’m not making any money so I can’t help with bills till I’m working again. She said she didn’t care about the money, and when I brought up not wanting to live with her boyfriend, she called me petty and said it’s none of my business who she sleeps with and I shouldn’t care and seemed extremely pissed at me. So I told her whatever and agreed to move in as soon as I could, then a couple days later she went back and said I could move whenever I feel like it. 

Since I had already agreed to move as soon as I could, I just kept with my plan and moved in at the beginning of the month. Now I’ve been here a few days and I can’t stand it, I’m stuck here all day since I’m broke, and she’s gone at work most of the day. Her boyfriend is also still here and is obviously pretty pissed I’m here but trying to act like he isn’t. Whenever Liz is around he will be all over her and calling her babe every few seconds, and I kinda wanna deck him in the schnitzel. As for Liz, she will barely talk to me when he’s around, so I honestly just feel like I’m an unwelcome house guest at this point. Liz and her boyfriend also don’t seem to be having any problems right now and seem perfectly happy, when I do rarely see them here.

So for the life of me, I can’t figure out what is going on with this girl, sometimes she is straight up trying to gain access to my pants, other days she’s making offhandedly remarks and statements about her and I, then the next day she’s pissed at me without any reasoning and seems completely happy with her boyfriend. 

A part of me really hopes that she wanted me to move in so her boyfriend would be more likely to leave and she’s been making all these remarks hoping that I’ll make a move. 

I’ve always been really insecure when it came to her specifically though, and the insecure part of me feels like she’s just using me to help her move to a bigger place where she’s gonna continue her relationship with her boyfriend and just ignore me.

I guess I’m kinda torn between the idea that she’s liked me the whole time and she’s using all this as a way to move on from her boyfriend and start something with me, and the fear that her and I aren’t even really friends and she’s just using me. A part of me really wants to just make a move and see, but if I do and she doesn’t actually feel that way, I’ll have ruined our friendship and most likely end up homeless till I’m working and can find a new roommate.

So what do you guys think? I really can’t tell with her. I know I probably should have just stayed away from her, but I’ve never been able to get over my feelings for her. I don’t know what it is, but she makes me nervous and awkward when I’m usually pretty cocky and flirty, and I’ve never felt like this about another girl.

TL;DR 
I have completely fallen for a girl who sends me mixed signals, has a boyfriend, and makes me go completely brain dead. Now I live with her and desperately want help figuring out what she wants and what I should do.

I’d love to have as many opinions and perspectives on this as I can. Thanks everyone for reading this insane rant.",2020.0,6.0,6.0,00:19:51,victim,90

We began as coworkers but quickly became friends.  Even after I moved two states away, we were still friends.  I would visit her when I came back to (home state) when visiting family (which was rare) and she has come to see me in my (new state) once, but she is single, lives alone, has pets and had a full time job so I understood why she couldn't visit. 

Over the years, we've exchanged birthday and Christmas gifts, talked probably once or twice a week.  In the last couple of years, the phone calls have tapered off some because we were working opposite hours and I had sick in laws that took up most of my time when I wasn't working.  But we still kept up with each other.  

In the last 2-3 years, she became an alcoholic.  I didn't realize to what extent because I haven't had any face to face contact with her during this time, but when we would talk on the phone, she was ""just starting on her first glass of wine"", then would have another two or three when I was talking with her, over the course of maybe an hour?  I didn't care, I figured she's an adult and if she's off work and in her own home, it's not my business how much she drinks.  She would complain about her job, her coworkers, etc.  I didn't realize she was performing so poorly at work they fired her.  That was about 9 months ago.  

About 8 months ago, I got a call from a mutual friend of mine and Britt's.  Kay had gotten calls from a few people saying they were concerned because no one had heard from Britt in a few days.  When Kay went over to Britt's house, she was lying on the floor, unconscious.  Ambulance was called, took her to the hospital.  Because of the alcohol abuse, her brain had suffered a type of ""injury"", also due to lack of a vitamin that made her brain work properly.  She was in the hospital for a few weeks, then was transferred to a rehab (physical, not alcohol) facility to learn how to care for herself.  

Kay called to let me know what happened.  Kay also told me that Britt's memory was not what it was, and she forgets day to day things, who she has talked to, her diagnosis...and what she didn't remember her brain made up for her.  She may never get better.  

The first month or two after she was in rehab, it was difficult to hold a conversation with her.  She wouldn't remember that we just spoke a day or two ago, and wanted to tell me the story over again how she ended up in the hospital, or just tell me she was in the hospital with no recollection of how she got there.  I would let her go over the story again and again, because I thought it was kinder to not upset her.  She would also say the doctors had no idea what was wrong with her and no one would tell her what her diagnosis was, or how long she was going to be in the rehab center.  Speaking with Kay, Britt was told repeatedly what had happened to her, her diagnosis, what the prognosis was, how she was found, this was due to alcohol, etc.   

While Britt was ill, a bunch of her friends got together to clean her house out, as it had become a hoarding situation, and unlivable.  Her animals were living in filth as was she.  Her bathroom didn't work.  She had very little food in the house, but many empty wine bottles.  According to the people who rented the dumpster to clean out her house, it was into the hundreds.  

Britt ended up leaving the rehab center and was unable to care for herself.  She had to move back in with her parents temporarily.  Her house was empty, and neighbors were at least feeding her animals and letting them outside to go potty.  

I was still keeping contact with Britt via phone.  She could not remember a timeline of things that happened to her, would argue with anyone who tried to tell her what disease she had or what had happened.  I suggested she might want to start writing things down so she could refer to that if she was having trouble remembering things, but she didn't want to.  She just flat out refused.  All she wanted to do was go live in her house with her pets.  I couldn't blame her for that, I wouldn't want to move back in with my parents either.  She said none of her friends would take her back to her house (because she is unable to walk/take care of herself) and needed to be watched to make sure she was taking her medication.  Some of her ""old"" self was coming back, like she could remember that we talked about a week ago, but she couldn't remember what she told me or what we talked about.  

Then she started drinking again. 

I asked her if her doctor said that was ok (I know it's not because I looked up her illness online), she said it was fine and she checked her medication interaction.  It's her life, she can do what she wants.  Her doctor called to see how she was doing and wanted her to come in to be evaluated.  She flat out refused.  I don’t think she takes her illness as seriously as she should. 

She ended up getting a ride home and is in her own house now.  I think it's better for her mental health but I'm not so sure about her physical health. 

Whenever we talk now, she complains that she needs help in her house, she can't do anything for herself.  I told her that she could check through insurance to get a home health aide to come in and assist, but she does not have insurance.  I suggested looking into ways to get on state health insurance, but she doesn't know how to do that.  Any suggestion I have for trying to get some help is met with ""I don't know how to do that, I'll look into it, I'll see what I can do.""  

She was very angry that her friends came in and cleaned her house.  I told her she was being unappreciative of her friends who only wanted to help her. She complained that they moved things around in her house and she can't find anything in her cabinets.  I asked if she planned to straighten out her cabinets and she said ""I don't have the energy for that.""  It seems like when we talk on the phone now, everything is a confrontation, she just wants to argue about everything.  She's very prickly.  

I know her brain isn't right.  I know she suffers from depression.  But I have a high stress job in healthcare and I really don't want any more stress by listening to her complain for an hour.  

The final thing for me was - she missed my birthday.  I am not talking about sending a gift.  I just wanted a text message or even a happy birthday wish.  We talked the day after my birthday, she didn't even bring it up.  She's so wrapped up in complaining that she doesn't see anything else.  So, I listened to her complain for about a half hour and then cut her off and told her I wanted to relax after a long day at work.  She got angry with me and told me in a voice dripping with sarcasm ""Oh! By all means, go relax!""  

That was the last straw for me.  I just don't want to engage with her at all.  I'm really sorry that her life is going downhill fast, but she does not do anything to help herself.  Am I in the wrong here for not calling her anymore?

673,64,158,(27f)(29m) My husband doesn’t care about me being upset because it’s happened “so often”.,12.0,gqlli4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gqlli4/27f29m_my_husband_doesnt_care_about_me_being/,16.0,1590477596.0,"We’ve been married after only a year together. I know I probably shouldn’t have entered this marriage but everything happened so quickly. 

He’s lied to me about his past extensively. About having them on social media. About his history with girls he still has contact with. He put me on a pedestal by acting like I was somehow special when I wasn’t. He said I was special and new in so many ways and I gradually found that out to not be true. He kept bringing up his exes a lot early on in order to “boost me up” so to speak. All lies. 

I can’t stand being lied to. I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for years and while I went through therapy, I still get quite easily triggered by certain things. 

I know I can get really upset and emotional sometimes. Especially when it comes to him lying to me, hiding things from me, omitting the truth, using loopholes. I can’t stand it. 

I keep finding out more and more loopholes and lies and omissions about his past. I know I shouldn’t care, because it’s his past, but I feel like I was manipulated into this relationship based on lies. I can’t help it. I wish I didn’t get so upset but it hurts me to uncover so many lies. 

And he tells me straight to my face, that he hasn’t lied. Even when there’s evidence. He just minimises it and says I’m talking bs and rolls his eyes at me and says he doesn’t care. It’s so upsetting. 

And now whenever I get upset, he openly tells me he doesn’t care. He literally says he doesn’t care because “I’m always upset”. He says it’s my fault that he doesn’t care anymore. 

He says that maybe if I didn’t get so upset and go questioning him about things then he would care more. He just rolls his eyes at me. 

He says my feelings are irrelevant and the things I get upset about don’t matter. Maybe it doesn’t matter that he downplayed the seriousness of his past, but then why lie to me? Maybe it doesn’t matter that his work colleague is actually an ex of his, but then why lie to me?

He can’t understand that his lies make everything seem shady and almost like he lovebombed me. 

He now just tells me my feelings are meaningless because I’m constantly upset. He doesn’t believe I’ll ever leave him so he doesn’t even pretend to care. 

I’ve begged him to care and he just rolls his eyes at me. He says I’m upset over irrelevant things. Recently I found out he lied to me about the way he treated me. From the beginning he acted like I was something so so special compared to his exes. When I found out I wasn’t, it hurt because I was being thrown off a pedestal. I just wish he hadn’t lied to me?! Why even bother putting me on a pedestal that I didn’t need? It feels like he lovebombed me with lies. 

Except now he doesn’t even care that he lied. In fact he said I deserve to be lied to because I’m constantly triggered and upset. He said I am like this all the time and that is why he doesn’t care. He says he used to care but I’ve made him not care. 

I wish I never asked questions. I wish I never enquired about his past and uncovered his lies. Maybe then he’d care about me. I keep begging for him to care about me and he just rolls his eyes and tells me my upset is meaningless. 

He can be so sweet sometimes. I know I get triggered easily and upset. I know I suffer from retroactive jealousy sometimes but I just wish he hadn’t lied to me. It makes all his compliments and gestures seem tainted when they were based on so many lies. Why did he have to bring his exes so much into it?

I’m so scared because it’s hard for me to leave this marriage because of religious and cultural reasons. I’m worried because I feel trapped and don’t think I can leave him. I know my parents will support me but it feels so difficult. Even thinking about a divorce, the troubles it might bring my family.... I can’t do it. I’m scared. And I don’t want to leave him either. He’s really good to me sometimes. I think it may be my fault that he’s like this now. He’s normally such a caring person. 

I don’t know how to make him care about me again. I’ve tried not getting upset for a long time and he’ll be sweet to me but now even if I get upset he doesn’t care. Is this my fault? I think maybe if I handled things better he would care more. I don’t know what to do. 

Do I deserve this? I think if I hadn’t have been so upset then he would care about me more. Maybe I’ve made him reach his limit and it is my fault. I just wish he cared about me a little bit. I care so much about him. Maybe I made him like this by being too emotional. I just want things to go back. 

**tldr** My husband has lied a lot about his exes to try and put me on a pedestal. It has all turned out to be lies which I find upsetting because it makes his gestures seem tainted. I have gotten upset and he tells me that he no longer cares about my upset because it doesn’t affect him anymore. I don’t know how to make him care again.",2020.0,5.0,26.0,13:04:56,victim,

We actually agree politically on most issues. It's just what to do/feel is how we differ.

So to keep it brief and have as little detail as possible since he also knows the story, Im currently away from home due to having suffered through emotional abuse for as long as I can remember from parentals. Around 2 months ago was when I left because it started getting worse due to having to be around them more because of quarantine. I left and am currently staying with another relative after having made my parents aware of the fact that I disagreed with the way they treated me and acted in general, especially considering the fact that my parents are in the middle of a divorce process, in which if I hadnt left they would have put me in the middle of it since I've always served as their tool for communication between each other. 

Ever since I came to stay with this relative of mine, I've been trying really really hard to recover, get back on track and take care of my mental health, but there's a few down sides. I asked for some space from both my parents which I feel they disregarded and haven't been prioritizing, they've continued to treat me in the ways I made them aware of even though they said they would do better, and now whenever I tell them Im not feeling the greatest they act like they have no clue why that could possibly be. With all these factors, its been making it harder for me to recover and take care of myself. 

Now on with the title, my boyfriend and I have been together for near 2 years now. Everything has always been super good, we have always gotten through disagreements rather quickly and without much struggle, we get along really well, and always do our best to support and care for each other. However, it is kind of known that I tend to, due to having lived through a lot of rough experiences, be a little bit more mentally resilient than he can be. We both acknowledge this so I make sure to put in a little extra effort than he has to to support both of us and it's made a balance. Neither of us mind this at all, but right now I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I've found myself unable to care for and support others due to my current mental state and I've told him that I, at the moment, cannot support him as much as I would like to. 

He says he understands and tells me that he wants to try to be there for me as much as possible, which I thank him for, but there is a down side. Whenever I start to let my strength fade and show how upset I really am, he gets visibly upset and shuts down. He starts to get in his own head and doesn't really know what to say. I can understand this because he grew up in a home with a very supportive, caring, loving, and secure family, so dealing with something like this isnt an everyday thing. But seeing him be upset starts to upset me more because it makes me feel like I shouldnt have said anything or just pretended everything was fine because then at least he wouldnt be brought down.

This has happened a few times and Ive been feeling myself start to mentally shut him out, putting up walls around me and thinking to myself ""what would he know about it anyways?"". Then I start telling him ""whats the point in talking if you're just gonna get upset when I do"" and frequently think about distancing myself. I try to be as open to him as I possibly can, but it feels like my mind is in a wreck and Im pushing him away when I know thats not what he wants, since he has told me so multiple times. He says he wants to try to be better for me, which I appreciate but I also feel like I cant take seeing him be sad from listening to me anymore. 

Is me trying to push him away toxic and a thought process I should try to fix? Is there anything I can do to make these situations better? Is there another solution that I'm simply just not thinking of?

TL;DR: Im trying to push my bf away so that I dont have to see him upset whenever I talk to him about how Im feeling and have been frequently considering distancing myself. Is this behavior towards him toxic? What can I do to make things better?",2020.0,5.0,29.0,22:27:28,victim,
676,67,165,I (21F) have realised that my dad (46M) is emotionally abusive towards my mom (42F),26.0,gq507t,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gq507t/i_21f_have_realised_that_my_dad_46m_is/,5.0,1590412576.0,"Hi. I made this throwaway to discuss another problem but unfortunately life has gotten in the way. 

I recently came to a realisation that my dad is emotionally abusive. I don't know how I discounted his behavior as being angry for so long but ever since I joined Reddit 3 months ago I have read so many accounts of emotionally abusive behavior that match with my dad's. 

To give you some background, my mom was emotionally, mentally and even at a point physically abused by my father's family. They didn't spare him either. They beat him up too and emotionally and mentally abused him as well. 

We used to live in a joint family before my grandparents kicked us out because my uncle got married and there wasn't any room left for us. They took all our possessions and sold them to us only at an outrageous price. 

It was hell. I was young and manipulated by my grandma to the point that I hated my mom. She spreads lies about my parents and at this point no one in my paternal family favours my parents over my uncle. 

My family never cut contact with them. In our culture we respect elders no matter what. Which is such bullshit because those elders are abusive and my uncle is younger but he still slapped my mom once.

Grandparents and uncle's family left our small town and moved to a city a 15 years back. My family stayed behind and those were the most peaceful 5 years of my life. 

Then we moved to city as well. 

At first our houses were 10 minutes apart. We did contact/ visit grandparents then but it was not very frequent. 

Now though we have ""talked issues out"" and 5 years back we all have moved to same apartment complex different flats. (no we haven't ""talked issues out"" mom is not allowed to bring up her past abuse and stay quite and do her duty to keep the peace that's it.)

And the fights have gone up. My grandpa got cancer 3 years back so dad visited him frequently and brought all the issues home. 

Since all the relatives favor uncle nobody sees mom and dad's sacrifices and efforts for grandpa. Infact grandma still badmouths them throught the neighborhood. 

There were some horrible fights in these years but it has turned ugly now. 

My mom never stood up for herself against grandma in her 22 years of marriage. She wasn't allowed to because ""she'll ruin everything further by saying something wrong"" as per dad. It was always dad standing up for her. She still hates herself for it. 

Now though she has started standing up in little ways. 

15 days ago, my grandpa passed away. Here in my culture we have an elaborate and long funeral procession of 13-14 days. Everyday since his death my family has spent the day at grandma's. 

Now one day my uncle was boosting about something my dad and mom did and dad sat quietly letting him take the glory. It didn't settle with mom and she just let it slip in the conversation that ""thank god I called so and so and thank god dad managed to convince the authorities""

Nobody said anything. The message was received and there were no drama. But my dad was pissed. 

He fought with mom twice in 10 days over this and it got really ugly. He threatened divorce, calling mom's parents to ""let them know what kind of person she was to try and ruin grandpa's funeral"" dad said ""I won't let you ruin my dad's funeral because you can't keep your mouth shut I have no option if you don't listen to what I say. I can only let your parents know since I can't raise my hand on you""

I was fucking devastated. 

Yesterday the same fight happened and the same things were said but this time my siblings and I stepped in. He threatened to call mom's dad (who would die before siding with his daughter over his son in law)

I got really mad and asked my dad ""would it be okay with you if my husband ever treated me like that"" and he got soooo mad. Called me names told me I am acting like a grown up when I know nothing and that he no longer considered me anything. 

My mom got mad and let it slip that he was under a loan from my mom's dad and yet he didn't care for his health and was okay with destroying maternal grandpa's peace of mind by ranting about mom. 

Dad got really quiet and started yelling and crying that we only see him as a wallet with no money to pay a loan and everyone was against him and was so mad mom bought up the loan. He threatened to leave at 11 in the night. That he was no longer anything to any of us from now on and we have damaged him beyond repair by saying this. 

I was so mad because somehow he made everything about himself. My mom has heard so many nasty things from him and his family over 22 years and one thing against him made him lose his mind. 

My siblings were crying and hugged him tight wouldn't let him go near the door. Mom started crying so hard and kept apologizing saying it was all her fault and please don't go and I just stood there while he kept repeating that no one was his in this family. 

I am so confused and angry and betrayed. I want to scream at him but mom made me promise that I won't say anything now. I hate him. I can't believe I didn't see how emotionally abusive he was to my mom. 

I want to convince mom to leave him but I know in my gut she won't ever. It's so against our culture and society to divorce. Honestly fuck everyone. I don't know what to do. 

Please help me. Divorce or leaving isn't an option. If the lockdown ends my sister and I will have to leave and I don't want to leave my brother and mom with him alone. 

I don't know what to do.

This is a pretty long post but I’d really appreciate you taking the time to read it, I’m super torn about this and just need some advice. Don’t be afraid to be brutally honest! With that being said I’ll explain the situation. 


My girlfriend (23) and I (22) had been together for almost exactly 7 months, we met last summer at the fair while we were both out with our families and since our families are longtime friends we stopped and chatted for a bit. She was really shy and didn’t say much to me  but about 3 weeks after that she sent me a message on Instagram just saying “hey, how’s life?” So we started talking a bit and I could tell she was interested in me so I suggested hanging out. We hung out and things went well, so we kept seeing each other for a couple weeks after and eventually started dating at the end of September. I knew things would be a little tougher with her cause as she had explained she had a history of every guy she dated cheating on her and being abusive etc, so she was super insecure but I know I’m a good dude who respects women so I figured I could handle it and I’d work with her to get through it. The thing is with her when she expressed things in a really negative way, instead of bringing up issues calmly and just asking questions it’s straight to accusations and rude comments, just an overall pretty negative way of inquiring about things. I have one female friend who I’ve had since grade 5 who I’ve never had any sexual involvement with or anything other than a platonic friendship on both sides. But my girlfriend acted really jealous of her even though I didn’t hangout with her one on one and we only texted here and there and it was nothing suspicious or inappropriate at all. At one point early in our relationship I even let her look at some of our conversations just to get some peace of mind. 

She kept having insecurities though and would always ask about my friend and other random girls I don’t even know who would like my photos on Instagram and stuff like that and she always thought I was talking to other girls online and everything, so I said eventually that I had had enough of it and that if she couldn’t trust me and give me an honest chance with her then I couldn’t further pursue a relationship with her. She told me she didn’t trust me cause “all men are cheaters” which at that point I realized there was no saving her. I said that I would go to relationship counselling with her and we could work on these issues together but she had to make a bigger effort to stop thinking the worst and to trust me. It was hard to understand cause although I could understand what she’s been through (I’ve been cheated on before as well) i literally hadn’t done anything at all ever and never acted suspicious or made weird comments or anything. I’m not an insecure person. I just couldn’t understand why she was acting like that. She told me she had tried counselling before and that nothing worked so I said that I wished her the best but that I was done, and after that she agreed to go to counselling and work on things. So we started seeing a counsellor together and have been for a couple weeks now, and things seemed to be getting better. Those issues of insecurity and stuff have rarely been brought up at all in the last couple months and she seems ok with my friend and she’s stepped up to put an effort in that way. 


There’s a couple other things to come to mind though, early in our relationship she let her younger brother come and stay with her at her house cause he had been kicked out of his parents place for being abusive and getting into drugs some other criminal activities. Which made me really worried for her safety cause this kid would just get high on who knows what and start being verbally abusive to her plus he never helped out with rent or food or anything like that at all. And she would also drop everything she was doin to go help him, didn’t matter if it was date night if he needed a ride to go to his buddies house and get high she was there. And if he needed a ride home from his buddies house or some random girls house cause he was drunk and high and didn’t want to walk home or find another ride then she would ditch me and bail on our plans and go do that. That obviously took a toll on our relationship, and even after talking to her about it and how I was feeling about us and her safety and mental health she pretty much said “I have my limits and I know when to stop, but I have to help him” I was pissed. Eventually we had to call the police and get them to take him out of the house because he was going off again one night while I was there and he almost started a fight with me. So that’s how that ended, also she eventually told me at one point that she was dating someone when we had met at the fair but after she saw me she couldn’t get me out of her head. This guy apparently robbed her after dating her for about a month and then took off with her stuff and left her and the relationship. We’re both busy people and run our own businesses but about 3-4 months in it was like she couldn’t make any time to just be present with me. Having one night a week where we could both just enjoy being with each other and talk and hangout seemed to be too much to ask cause every time we got together to hangout it devolved into her being glued to her phone and watching something on her phone or being on social media. Didn’t seem like there was much point in spending time together at that point. Whenever we did talk it seemed to be all about her complaining about her life or talking about her day and I would take time to listen and respond but when I would try and talk to her she would have responses like “oh wow, really?” Or something redundant like that and then go back to talking about her stuff or just be on her phone. When I would ask her about something or for her opinion “I don’t know” was a common phrase in her vocabulary. Another time we were talking about our friends and she said “I can’t lie I think so and so is pretty cute” when referring to my best friend who she’s never met. And she’s made other comments about him off and on that seem weird to me but I didn’t ever question it cause I’m not an insecure guy and I didn’t see that as a problem till eventually I caught myself thinking “really? Wtf you’ve never even met this guy what’s the deal” As you can tell I was and still am somewhat I guess pretty frustrated about all this. 

Despite all that we kept going to counselling and things got better between us. To the point where every downside I mentioned before was pretty much a non issue. She was talking to me about how she wanted to have my kids and get married etc etc. But one night she randomly went through my phone when I was sleeping and found nothing, no evidence of me cheating or being unfaithful in any way. The only thing she found was some articles I read about relationship problems online and she got super upset about that. 


At this point I’m thinking “I thought we were past all this? What’s really going on”. So a couple nights later I go through her phone and find out that she had been texting with her ex while we were together and at one point said “I was missing you today, sometimes I still catch myself tripping but I want you to be happy” (keep in mind this guy verbally and physically abused her for years and still tries to harass her off and on to this day). I also found another guy who a couple weeks after we started dating she had asked him if he would be in the city next to us on a weekend to which he replied “yeah I’m down to chill, and I better see that booty 🤣” at this point I figure I’ve seen all I need to and I break up with her after telling her what I found in her phone. It’s crazy to me that after being so paranoid about me being sleezy she was doing the same thing! I even asked her early in our relationship if her ex was still texting her and if they were talking when she mentioned being harassed by him constantly and she said no, which was a lie cause the dates on the messages from when they were talking were right around when I had asked that. 


All that happened within the first month of us officially being in a relationship and I couldn’t see any recent messages between either the ex or that other guy, or any messages exchanged between them for the last few months. But still it drives me nuts that that even happened. 

Her explanation for the guy she was trying to meet up with in the city next to us was that he was an old coworker that treated her badly and she wanted to setup a meetup with him and then ghost him to get revenge. And the stuff with her ex she said she regretted saying that after she told him “I miss you etc.” But didn’t come clean when I asked cause she was embarrassed that she was still talking with a guy who had abused her. She also said other things about the random guy like “I just wanted validation, I didn’t cut off as many people as I should have in the beginning and like you did and I’m sorry” and other stuff but it just doesn’t add up to me fully. She said that the reason she generally treated me a bit poorly sometimes (stuff with her brother, not being invested) was because she was really scared to commit for the longest time, she said she had this fear that she was going to get really invested in me and then I would just leave or cheat on her like the other guys she’s dated. 

I ended up breaking up with her over that and then we had some on an off stuff going on, I went on tinder right after for like 4 days cause I was really upset about the situation and that was my poor way of coping. I was honest with her about it, and she was really upset that I was on tinder talking to other girls. So that’s my side of it, I know it’s not cool to be going back to her and then leaving again repeatedly. 

What makes this so conflicting is throughout our time together she always made it clear how attractive she found me and we had sex all the time multiple times a week and sometimes like 5 times a day and after seemingly working out most of her issues she’s been an amazing, loving girlfriend who surprises me with random gifts and always makes me food and worries about me and wants to spend almost every day with me and sleep with me every night. Right now we’re talking and there’s been a couple blow outs on both sides, just us expressing our hurt and frustrations in some not so good ways. But we’ve both acknowledged that and are trying to communicate in a negative way, regardless of weather we get back together or not. She wants to get back together right away and I want to work through everything fully and take time to think about things before jumping back into a relationship. 


So I’m not sure what to think, like I said before any advice or opinions would be greatly appreciated and I’d love to get a woman’s opinion on this too. Thank you for taking the time to read.

We've been together over a year now, but known each other since we were 15/16. 
It never bothered me that he didn't have an opinion about things, and that he wasn't an argumentative person. He's very placid and kind hearted. 

But lately since being in a relationship with each other I've found his parents are just flat out rude to him sometimes. They belittle him and berate his life choices etc. 
Example,  it was more financially viable to have one of us stay home and look after my son (previous relationship)  and because I was making more money,  and his job was making him miserable he quit and became the stay at home parent. 
But his parents hated it, they kept going on about how he's a burden, he needs to do something with his life, I should be the one at home and he should be making money, when is he going to get another job, he needs to go back to studying etc etc. 
This went on for about a month before I had enough and lost my cool after his mum made a snarky comment about how looking after a child is the mother job and I'm a fem-nazi for ""making him do a woman's job"" . 

Unless I had said something my partner would've continued to feel terrible after every visit to his parents. It makes me wonder how long that behaviour would have gone on if I haddn't've said anything. 

Since then, his parents have made it clear that my son is their ""step-grandson"" and with our new baby on the way have begun to ""forget"" about my son. Example his birthday was Monday and they didn't wish him a Happy Birthday (nor did my partners sister) and I was upset. 

When I told my partner that I was upset, he said he didn't want to say anything because he didn't want to upset anyone and that he doesn't want to have an opinion and he ""can't talk to his parents about it"". I'm concerned that because he won't stand up for himself, that he won't do it for me, my son or the new baby we've got coming. 

I don't know how I feel about it. It makes me angry that he doesn't stand up for himself, and I don't know how to be supportive enough so he has the confidence to tell his family to back off when necessary and when they (or anyone) treat his new family poorly. 

Tl:DR: my partner doesn't have the guts to stand up for himself. And now we have kids he doesn't stand up for them either. Especially against his parents. His parents are treating my son (previous relationship) unequal to the new baby we have on the way. 

How can I be supportive?  How can I get him to stand up to his parents? How do I teach my partner when it's time to say enough to being walked over???",2020.0,4.0,2.0,00:51:09,victim,15
679,70,169,My husband (23M) doesn’t like the I (22F) smoke weed occasionally.,52.0,fl9b6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fl9b6m/my_husband_23m_doesnt_like_the_i_22f_smoke_weed/,199.0,1584650120.0,"Sorry for the long post, but in order to answer the question there is some background required. 

I met my husband when we were eleven. We started dating soon after and have been together for eleven years now (married for almost three). 

Three years into the relationship, he told me he didn’t like alcohol or weed at all and, at the time, I had never seen myself doing it, so I guess we never cared to talk more about it. Years roll by, and he goes off to the military after high school while I go to college. We ended up being long distance for a total of four and a half years. 

About two years into the long distance, I guess I began changing as a person and wanted to try alcohol and weed. I have grown up my whole life surrounded by it. Nearly all of my family and friends smoke/drink or have smoked/drunk at least once. I had just never seen a good or bad reason to do it. As you can guess, my husband did NOT react well to the fact that I wanted to try drinking and smoking weed. He literally slept on the couch one night because I had ONE glass of wine. 

While he’s MUCH better about the alcohol now, he still says he had to make himself so uncomfortable to be okay with that. However, he can’t see himself being able to get over the fact that I’m a “drug user” as he put it, and he doesn’t want to have kids with someone who uses drugs. He says he would have kids with me but not with a drug user. 

He’s completely unwilling to compromise. Even if I only do it once in a blue moon, never do it around him, never talk about it around him, *literally anything* to make it appear like I don’t even know what weed is - it’s still not enough to him. He says he knows it’s unfair to me, but he can’t help but feel like he has to give me an ultimatum. 

Now, I understand my fault in this argument. I am the one that changed, and I should have been more upfront. We both should have communicated what we expected out of the relationship better. But, I feel like he’s being unreasonable. I don’t abuse it. I only use it to relax with my friends or family sometimes. I’m not being disrespectful by smoking it straight in his face. I also don’t expect this to be a part of my life when I’m over the age of fifty. 

I’m just worried that if I try to quit because he wants me to quit, that it will just back fire. I might end up resenting him in the end for having to say “my husband won’t allow me” or whatever. I’m also worried that I’ll just end up picking it back up every few years and hurt him more. 

He’s just my best friend, and I don’t want to lose him over him not even being okay with me smoking once every few years. 

Should I end the relationship or have to give weed up? 

TL;DR! Husband and I have been together since we were kids. He never liked alcohol or weed but when I got to college, I wanted to try it. He did not take it well. He is not willing to compromise even an inch or let me just smoke weed at concerts. I want to have fun and relax a little every once in a while in the way I want, but I don’t want to lose this intimate relationship I have either. Should I end the relationship or give up weed?",2020.0,3.0,20.0,02:20:20,victim,
680,71,170,My Girlfriend has a really stressful job and I am developing control issues.,5.0,gxk1me,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gxk1me/my_girlfriend_has_a_really_stressful_job_and_i_am/,4.0,1591445222.0,"Me (27) and my gf (29) have been together for 1 yr & 1 month. 

Im apologizing for the wall of text about to ensue. 

My background is one of stress, gaslighting and emotional abuse. I am the scapegoat in the family and I am routinely gas lighted and high-horsed cause I also am the first to curse in an argument and the fam shut down all communication after that starts cause ""i cant be civil so i dont deserve to be talked to when im like this"". My gf has history of emotional abuse from family, past relationships, and ongoing scapegoating. it Has gotten better for her since I started dating her as i cleaned her room for her and helped her get her biggest shit in order and she did the same for me in other places in my life. thats about all the back story I think yall need for this. 

We have a d/s dynamic that is a very relaxed 24/7 since we don't live with eachother right now but separate states from eachother, about 2hr drive from eachother. the gf's job is working with, not for, cps and helping kids and families get help for what they need, disabilities, trauma, whatever. she can do this job hands-down and is capable enough to learn what she needs but her anxiety makes her think and feel like she is failing every single day. out of the less than 2months that she has worked there, she woke up vomiting after the first week, she has continously has an ongoing mild panic attack, and she cant sleep because she is finally getting her first ""fresh"" kid (she has had other children/families but always finishing the last half of a job. this is the first time she will be having to handle a family from start to finish of the services provided by the company). 

her therapists say that she needs to give it a lot longer than she has before she even seriously considers quitting but it is always on her mind because she ""isn't cut out for this. not trained. And any training can't be focused on cause she can only think about how much she wants to quit because she isn't ready and never had a Job like this one"" even though she has worked for years in a group home for the exact children and families she is handling now. 

My issues are that I am trying to control her situation for her as much as possible and are stressing out about her problems like they are mine. in a way they are because our next 12 month plan (getting a place together, saving up for future, etc) depends on her having a job as much as me having one and this job pays well enough and gives benefits. but im trying to get her to do things the way I would do them and I know it's not gonna work. so I stop myself. but the stress, the way I talk to her, the way I handle her and listen to her has all changed because I'm looking for the solution to the problem and not being there for her emotionally and supporting her. I'm solving her problems for her. 

I dont know what to do to help her as I have anxiety, depression, and adhd but my adhd and depression are the very big factors and anxiety plays historically low roles so I don't know how to handle crippling anxiety like she has. I am a very big ""its better to ask forgiveness than permission"" person and she is the opposite. I am not used to or apparently capable of putting myself in her shoes to handle her disorders and give her advice. all I can do is be on the phone while she cries and tells me repeatedly she wants to quit. 

i have so far stopped the controlling and solving her issues for her and instead are giving her the hard truth. she hasn't given her job a good enough test run yet, she can quit any time but she can't get a job as easily, she can't afford to distract herself and if she keeps playing animal crossing/watching tv/being consciously an insomniac instead of trying to get to sleep (cause if she sleeps she wakes up and has to work vs watching TV for hours until she physically can't and crashes, and then has to wake up and work) and she needs to be an adult and find another job while she does her best at this one. 

how can i help her? how can i point her in the right direction or motivate her to do the right thing when she doesn't want to and will fight me on it. I've seen where this behavior leads and been there myself and I don't want this becoming an issue. 

there are some things that will have to be cleared up. I will not tolerate ""break up with her"" comments or anything belittling mental disorders. I will not respond to those and will report them without hesitation. I'm looking for help not insults. I wont break up with her because she is very capable, intelligent, and worst case we can get her a different job in another field because this only occurred because of the specific job she is at. but my first priority is to help her succeed at this one as it is in her collegiate field and a good first step to being the therapist she has wanted to do for ages. we are discussing if this is a direction she wants but as it stands she still wants to be a therapist. 

Tl:Dr gf is in super stressful job and I found myself trying to solve her problems for her rather than be supportive and listening to her solve her own problems. how can i help her, how can i help her cut through her own anxiety and issues to find out what she really wants in life, how can i be supportive when all the support I ever knew was to have a problem solved for me ( I know how to support myself, not others), what else can me or her do and anything else or other advice that might help.",2020.0,6.0,6.0,17:52:02,victim,27

It is however rather more complicated and I really need some direction. I love this girl very much, I want a future with her, and I really want all of our issues to be mine so that I can get a handle on it, take responsibility and deal with each issue accordingly.

As things stand, we are in a toxic cycle. I feel my girlfriend is involuntarily manipulative, she struggles to take responsibility for any upset she causes me, she is quite amazingly indecisive and constantly cycles between blaming me for everything, love bombing me and even blaming herself during periods of rare reflection. When we argue, she will often stonewall, this particular tactic began a few months back despite my insistence that it is not ok. One day she’s absolutely fixed on a particular opinion, and the next she contradicts herself entirely and effectively denies saying whatever she may have said. When challenged, she’ll resort to childish retorts “I won’t tell you anything then”. She can on one hand be the most mature, level headed individual in my life and I’ve watched her give very sensible relationship advice to others, but on the other she treats me like a parent when held to account.

I am certainly not perfect. After an abusive childhood I have a temper, clinical depression, I’m needy and suffer bouts of low self esteem. After months of therapy a few years back I’ve got a handle on a lot of my own failings and can better manage my behaviour, but there’s no magic bullet.

In 18 months together, she has broken up with me during an argument 10 times. After each discard, she either apologises profusely or I do and plead with her to stay. I must admit, I am terrified of not having her in my life because when we are connected and close, it is the best relationship I’ve ever had. We understand each other so well, we care for one another, we make each other happy, and in her words “we are bestest friends”. She can be and is the kindest person I’ve ever met for extended periods of time. I don’t want this to be another relationship that didn’t work out, I want there to be solutions, but I’m not sure there are healthy ones.

I’m going to break this down somewhat into bitesized chunks of crazy. I’m sorry it’s long, just read however much of this that you want. I’d really appreciate your advice.

Some background:

My girlfriend and I met in September 2018. I’d not long left a relationship and was still dealing with my ex girlfriends drama. I wasn’t ready to start a relationship, but we text one another most days after an initial meet. We’d make each other laugh so much and genuinely didn’t think we were good enough for the other. We didn’t actually start dating until January 2019, but quickly got as close as we thought we would and things progressed very well.

She was living 60 miles away with her parents, I have my own house (that I’m in the process of renovating completely). We are both educated and experienced, she has a professional career and I’m freelance. She was desperate to move out and create some independence from her parents whom she described as ostentatious, overbearing and in the case of her mother, a manipulative little Hitler who’d lost touch with her first two children (she has 4) during a marital separation (there is a significant age gap between the siblings, and my girlfriend has never met them). It became apparent that her mother had held her back from pursuing university, and quite clearly had held on to her youngest daughter way longer than was reasonable. My girlfriend justified staying with them for so long (I moved out at 18 so to me, it’s unusual) because they had a huge house, and she was trying to save for a mortgage.

We fell in love, and as the months went by, she naturally began moving in with me. She found her commute to work from my place wasn’t quite as bad as she expected and she enjoyed living in the countryside location my house sits in. She didn’t impose herself, I was delighted to have her join me.

We got along well, cooked together, ate together almost every night, watched movies, walked for miles in the hills, we took a break away to go and visit my brother a few hundred miles away. We were a proper couple, and saw one another as ‘the one’.

Early summer 2019, the problems began. She had already warned me that she could become emotionally detached when other people important to her were in her company. She told me that she struggled to keep everyone close at the same time, and focussed quite intently on who she was with at that moment. This warning was given whilst en route to meet the only sister she has a relationship with. We met her at her parents house, and very quickly I could see my girlfriend withdraw from me and almost change to suit her sister’s personality. She became more brash, opinionated, materialistic. It was quite striking, I’d seen this before in an ex (I understand is known as mirroring?). That very evening, there was a disagreement during a political conversation and very quickly my girlfriend leapt to the defence of her sister, putting me down in the process and belittling my views. Rather odd, I hadn’t seen this before in her. Perhaps it was my fault for mentioning such a controversial subject. We discussed it days later and she agreed it was unreasonable of her. I told her that I needed more respect from her when in the company of others (acutely aware of her mother’s manipulative tendencies I didn’t want any vulnerabilities exposed in that household in particular), and we left it at that.

Her parents:

They’ve lots of money, they’re very entitled and very closed minded. Although they’ve always been immediately welcoming, there is little that can be discussed that isn’t later weaponised by her mother. She has quite openly remarked in front of others “his house is awful, the work he’s done is great but it’s awful in places”, which just seems unnecessarily frank and uncalled for. You get the feeling that everything she says is designed to be confrontational and often she likes to be controversial to get a rise from people. She has brought up my finances several times as she clearly doesn’t understand what I do for work and perhaps feels I’m not working hard enough, or I’m not wealthy enough for her, despite never witnessing me in a work environment nor me ever bringing up money in her company. She’ll throw a comment into a conversation between the sentences of others that are hard to challenge without the victim being confrontational themselves; my girlfriend was discussing a situation at her work and whilst catching her breath her mother turned to me and said “oh you don’t work do you” before instantly correcting herself “oh I forgot, you work on your computer”. My girlfriend carried on as if nothing had been said. Such situations have occurred many times.

The first time I brought this up with my girlfriend she seemed understanding and clearly felt uncomfortable that I was in this position. She agreed to challenge her mother the next time such a remark was made, but of course this didn’t happen. I brought it up again and again, but her responses grow in frustration with little ambition to actually resolve the issue. Perhaps she’s afraid of her. Instead, I resorted to defending myself from her mother’s comments with a return quip or two, and it has since become a point of bitterness that my girlfriend now believes to be of MY making! When I’ve asked my girlfriend more recently why she doesn’t defend me to her mother, she tells me I don’t need defending, and that I bring it upon myself.

Each time we see them now, she suggests going alone because I “don’t like them”, which completely undermines the actual dynamic and absolves her of any responsibility.

Friends:

She was invited to a ‘best’ friend’s wedding, and it seemed to be the only thing on her mind for what felt like months. There were two hen dos, one of which was abroad, dress fittings, meals out to plan, and the actual wedding itself. I wasn’t invited.

And then there was another friend’s wedding, this time she stayed over with me at one of my friend’s houses in town to be near to the venue. I wasn’t invited.

Parties, meals out, evenings in town, I wasn’t invited to any of it. We have been together for 18 months now and I’ve met her primary group of friends twice, once during a planned ‘introduction’ at a bar when we got together and again on her birthday in November. None of her friends have ever been to our house. It has left me baffled, and I feel like such an embarrassment to her. She has argued “that’s just how my friends are”, and I have argued “yes, but you are responsible for your interactions too”. Conversely, I have introduced her to everyone I know. She’s a popular figure in my village pub, has become friends with the friends I have here (I moved into this region 5 years ago so most of my social contacts are 350 miles away) and met those further afield during trips back ‘home’ with me.

One of her social engagements involved staying at her parents for the weekend whilst they were on holiday. We went to her parents house together and she then went out to see her friends, leaving me to sit for her parents dogs. By this point I was really beginning to feel left out and forgotten. We text one another that evening as she became progressively more inebriated before eventually telling me she was sick of me texting her, “my friends don’t have to constantly text their boyfriends when we’re all out. I can’t deal with your anxiety”. She then immediately ended the relationship with me over the phone whilst I begged her to be reasonable. She got a taxi back, blaming me for ending her night early, and on her arrival at the house shouted at me repeatedly whilst quite clearly still very drunk. Some of the highlights:

“You’re controlling”
“You’re making my life miserable”
“This level of anxiety isn’t normal, I can’t deal with it”
“Maybe I want someone else”

I sat there crying in bed, trying to work out why this person who loved me intensely 12 hours prior now wanted to have me surgically removed from her life as if I was some sort of tumour. I had every intention of getting my things together and driving home the next morning.

However when we wake, she apologises profusely. She didn’t excuse any of her actions and admitted she couldn’t treat me like this again, that she was desperate for another chance and pleaded with me not to end the relationship (that she ended the evening prior). She blamed alcohol for her emotional instability, and immediately swore to give up drinking. I suggested this was a major undertaking and perhaps just try moderating it, but she refused and said she doesn’t know how to.

Her sobriety lasted a few weeks, before admitting she isn’t going to stick to it and it was an overreaction of her to suggest this. Instead, she agreed not to drink around friends when we weren’t together as I am able to moderate her drinking for her when we’re together (her words). Come the next night out without me, naturally she drank and completely undermined her voluntary commitment to me. She denied drinking until the moment I picked her up and smelt it on her breath. Her excuse for not admitting this earlier (when we were texting intermittently throughout the night) was that I’d be angry with her. It caused a huge row.

Autumn:

Come November, we were asked to spend the whole month at her parents house to dog sit whilst they travelled Australia. I work from a laptop and her parents house is actually closer to work, so it didn’t inconvenience us too much. It was quite an upheaval and I must admit I find such change difficult to deal with, but it was temporary at least. As the weeks went by, she surprised me on the phone one evening during her drive back from work by telling me “I can’t treat you like I have any longer, I want to get help. I’m going to get therapy”, which of course I welcomed. I insisted that our issues were not all of her doing, that we each had a responsibility to solve our collective issues, but she insisted everything stemmed from her. I didn’t agree, and still don’t, but I welcomed her enthusiasm to seek some much needed support.

For the second time in our relationship, I was invited to spend the day with her and her friends to celebrate my girlfriend’s birthday. We went out for pizza, and conversation flowed between everyone until her ‘best friend’ (she has two) asked her “do you fancy a Nando’s in the week?” to which my girlfriend immediately responded with “sounds great!”. Now, this wouldn’t be out of the ordinary at all, if it wasn’t for the fact that I was staying with her at her parents place all month to dog sit. This would mean leaving me to it for the evening whilst she heads off to socialise with friends that are quite obviously not particularly interested in getting to know me. It struck me as really rude. Later that evening I asked her about this and she immediately responded with “oh I’m not going, I just didn’t want an argument”. Why on earth would saying “no” and reiterating the circumstances that they were already fully aware of or perhaps even suggesting “can my boyfriend come?” cause an argument?

We spent the immediate Christmas period with her parents. It wasn’t particularly enjoyable and the atmosphere was tense. We argued when away from family members fairly constantly. We drove down to see my family 350 miles away after Christmas, and the bickering was mostly non-stop. On our way home after new year, she reneged on her voluntary obligation to seek help, told me it was all my fault, that I made her feel that it was her fault, that it’s actually all my fault and I’m the one who needs help. She accused me of being manipulative and controlling. Ever since this day, she has refused to accept that she needs any sort of help and won’t even get couples counselling with me.

Disney:

Her parents have been excitedly reminiscing about  Disneyworld holidays they had as a family right up until a couple of years ago. They asked if I would go, and insisted they’d pay for everything. I wasn’t comfortable with it especially, as the thought of spending two weeks with them fills me with dread. Furthermore, it felt rather odd that they’d take a 35 year old to such a place without children and at their expense. My girlfriend was desperate for us to accept the offer, so over lunch one day and in front of her parents, she mentioned it once again, knowing I’d have to accept.

This was scheduled for September 2020, but has been postponed a year due to the pandemic (thank god).

Lockdown:

We struggled through until March, when she ended the relationship whilst on a walk at the beach. She was tired of me talking about coronavirus, argued my suggestion that she should insist on working from home was controlling, and went on a tirade about how I don’t allow her independence. She told me that I am stopping her from seeing friends, family, that I’ve taken her away from her life, and I’m trying to turn her against her parents. I sat down and sobbed as I watched her turn on her heels and morph into the cold and heartless version of herself that seems to hate everything about me. We agreed to leave the beach and drove home. She packed her things and left. On her way to her parents, I called her and apologised for talking about the upcoming pandemic too often and tried to rationalise all of the arguments had about friends and family. I was freaking out and deeply afraid of losing her forever. She went from being very cold and distant to emotionally aware in a couple of minutes. It was agreed she’d come back and we’d try to find compromises that work for us, and that she’d have more independence, which translated means she’s going to see her friends and family more often and I will not be included. I’m not sure why she wanted this to be the case, she is my world and I want her to be included in my life fully.

Coronavirus takes hold and the UK gradually becomes one of the worst affected countries in the world. Lockdown happens, she is forced to work from home. Fast forward two and a half months and we’ve had the most peaceful period of our relationship to date. We have been getting on so well, we feel close, there’s very little to argue about (whilst the world is still a very stressful and scary place), we have no real qualms. We’ve been working on the garden together, watching movies, enjoying the sun, exercising and having a generally pleasant life. It is quite the opposite of most people’s experiences.

Today, we met her parents for the first time in months. Despite their desire to come over to the house, we insisted on abiding by the law and met them instead in a park halfway and would socially distance for the duration. The meet went initially quite well despite my girlfriend’s anxiety about their commitment to social distancing (she is now taking the pandemic very seriously), but I felt belittled toward the end. I mentioned that I wasn’t happy with a garden project I’ve been working on and said “I don’t want it to be perfect, but cottage like...” and my girlfriend interjected with “it’s not going to be perfect, hahaha”, giving her mother the opportunity to retort “well no it’s not going to be if you’re doing it yourself”. It felt completely uncalled for, especially since I take such pride in my work and have been working on property for my whole adult life. This particular property has become my career during lockdown since all of my clients have suspended operations. When I questioned my girlfriend about her retort on our way home, she immediately accused me of being over sensitive and refused to admit that she’d done anything wrong. She denied hearing what her mother said. That was 6 hours ago and I have kept myself busy since getting home, occasionally asking my girlfriend if she understands why what was said was hurtful, she has so far told me “I’m not going to apologise, it wasn’t meant to hurt you and you were over sensitive if it did. You were bound to be offended by something today”. I even went so far as to text her a link to a psychology site discussing why telling someone they’re over sensitive is unhelpful, but she refused to read it. I feel undermined, belittled and as if I have no recourse. I guess we’re back to square one.

TL;DR

My girlfriend of 18 months doesn’t treat me with respect in the company of others. She breaks up with me regularly, flip flops, mirrors the behaviour of others, yet she can also be the kindest, most loving person I’ve ever met. I don’t know how to make her see sense, or what to do next.",2020.0,5.0,27.0,20:16:52,victim,18

I also stumbled upon her pastime (reading fanfics) which seems to indicate she isn’t dealing with issues in the healthiest of ways**

(This is very complicated but I’ll do my best to explain the background while keeping things as short as possible. The fanfic part will be very important but not until the end…)

A friend from high school and I ended going to the same state college 3 years ago, we weren’t close during high school but we used to hang out and have a positive relationship and connect with the same pastimes during that time. When we decided on schools we decided to stick together and room together for the first year since it was so convenient, we ended up spending a bunch of time outside of classes and meeting a ton of people together and just overall growing to be really good friends.

Around that time he met a girl and they hit it off pretty fast, they became serious halfway through the year and had really intense vibes which our group of friends would all joke about. We would all spend time together and have a good time, but around that time I found a part time job and was part of a sports club and was more than happy in making myself scarce to let them do their thing.

Unfortunately, my friend did not make it into his major at the end of the first year and he decided to transfer to a school which isn’t as competitive in another state, I ended up moving out of the dorms with the group of friends he left behind. It was a sad time, particularly for his girlfriend who he later confided in me suffers from anxiety problems and has suffered emotional abuse from past relationships. Since he knew me best he asked me to try to keep her company and do my best to cheer her up since their relationship was now long distance and they would most likely only get to see each other during the breaks.

At this point I imagine you might have an idea where I’m going… We started hanging out more and more, but we didn’t really connect much. I’d say apart from the common ground my friend meant, we tolerated each other, though sometimes I could tell we’d both do things or talk about things both of us didn’t care for, etc. Our personalities clashed because she tends to be very cynical/pessimistic/sarcastic while I am more positive and warmer and give people the benefit of doubt. Our friends at that time joked that our dynamic was brotherly because we’d constantly argue and bicker about the things that happened in our day to day because she’d just scoff and put down things for what I thought were unjust reasons.

At around this time unfortunately a very close family member of hers died suddenly, and as far as I could tell she did not have a positive relationship with them before their death. She took it extremely hard; I think she always had the hope of someday making things better. We all noticed what happened, the change was like night and day. Instead of taking things in her usual sardonic way, conversations with her just devolved into her being uninterested or outright extremely negative. The weeks passed and she stopped hanging out with our group as much. I tried talking to her about it, and about her change in mood a few times, but she would react with hostility, repeating that she was tired of people getting into her business and that she had a damn therapist and that that was the end of it. I tried talking with her boyfriend about it but around that time he started becoming lukewarm about the topic whenever I asked about how things were going with her, so I decided not to push it.

Since she wasn’t around as much I made a big mistake and started seeing her more one on one and also with her family when she went back home (I had a great relationship with her mom who seemed to me an amazing person) and at her place after classes to hang out and sit on her couch while she watched series on Netflix (and not much else since she didn’t want to talk about herself and her day to day, and anything I said was just caustically spat back at me) or else she would do stuff on her phone. One day I questioned her about what she did all day on her phone and that is where I learned what fanfic was (I had no idea, and even now I don’t entirely get it). I showed her what reddit was, and I was there when she made her account (which she never used; this is going to be important for later). I say this is a mistake because this went on for a long while and I think I ventured into the whole area of giving her the illusion of emotional support without ever truly discussing anything or helping her work through things, and anyway this was probably a role that her boyfriend, family, or therapist should have played.

I don’t want to rationalize or justify any of my emotions or actions, but at around this time I started having feelings for her. Seeing her this way was heartbreaking. I have gone through grief in my own life with people in my family (but never in a traumatic way like this situation), and the way we dealt with it was by being there for each other and crying with one another and just being more open and speaking about our pain and not trying to hide or play tough-guy. Now, more than a year later, I can see that what I wanted to do is ache with her and hopefully have her back on her feet mocking everyone in our friend group in a positive tongue-in-cheek way, with none of the resentment and bitterness that she was now carrying. But realistically now in hindsight I can see I was extremely unqualified to try to give support, especially to someone who comes from such a different emotional cultural background to mine.

Anyway, towards the end of the second year I had started toiling with my own emotions and it started affecting my relationship with her. She mentioned I started becoming more aloof and colder and lukewarm and not speaking with her or joking around like always. I stopped hanging out with her as much, and all in all I started feeling extremely conflicted all the time. I snapped at her a few times because supposedly I was not okay with the way she was dealing with her problems, but now I wonder if what I was really snapping about was my own emotions and feeling that I could not help her in any tangible way.

At this point we had stopped texting and talking for a few weeks, and she invited me over to talk over everything that was happening with our friendship after she finished up with one of her finals. That day I stopped outsider her house and one of her housemates let me in, and I plopped on the stairs leading to her room while I waited for her. She was running a little late and I grew bored and bitter about the whole thing, since I was certain she would question me about the way I had been acting while I couldn’t ask her about how she was feeling about anything. Without justifying any of my actions, I did something terrible and I snuck into her room. She had told me offhandedly one day that she was incredibly annoyed at her therapist because she made her keep a journal, but she wouldn’t show me it when I asked what it was about (I know my actions were not cool, dealing with her grief is her own road to travel). I went into her room and found her journal and I read the last entry which (long story short) was about a recent night during a weekend I hadn’t seen her, she wrote she had woken up remembering her dead family member and that she couldn’t help but cry ‘like an useless idiot’ all day, and didn’t want to bother anyone with her emotions, not even her family and friends, and that she did not feel like doing anything, and that even though her ‘stupid’ therapist made her keep a journal it only tortured her more than anything. And that she didn’t know when she’d ever feel normal again.

I was devastated and in no shape to have a conversation with her. I didn’t even notice she had arrived and was standing at the door of her own room quietly while I held her journal. She blew up and yelled at me and threw me out. I tried to talk to her but nothing was calming her down so I did another extremely questionable thing, and threw it into the air that I had feelings for her and that I cared for her as a last hail-Mary attempt to make her “see” (and now I question myself, see what?!?).

She went no contact with me and told me through another friend that we would never talk again and that she couldn’t believe I would play her like that and take advantage of her. Now, at the time I tried not to justify or rationalize my own actions, I was and still am painfully aware that we people tend think in ways that make ourselves seem better so naturally I asked myself, who knows? maybe she was right and I didn’t even know it.

I spoke to her boyfriend about it and about how conflicted I was… and he took it extremely well, which worried me. He said she was overreacting and that this would all blow-over and that I shouldn’t worry about it. I felt he was being uncannily apathetic about it and questioned why he didn’t take her side, if apparently this was such a big deal to her. From what I knew of her I got the sense that maybe he wasn’t being supportive of her regarding anything in her life and I didn’t feel right going on with a friendship with him like nothing had happened, all the while she carried every single burden on her own. We fought over that and stopped talking like we used to, but still send each other texts for holidays and birthdays (nothing else).

That was a year ago. Things moved on and time has gone by, and I’ve been worried about school and finding an intership and haven’t had a lot of time to bring myself closure. I find myself wondering about her often… The other day was especially bad and (again without justifying my actions) I looked her reddit username up hoping to find that she’d talk to people online about her problems anonymously instead of shutting herself off to the real world.

I wasn't surprised to see she never used her reddit account. BUT I found an account on archive of our own (a fanfic website, I learned) under the exact same name.

I don’t understand much about this sort of culture but I was morbidly curious when I found her username, and I started investigating. In the past few days I learned that people often use it as a form of escapism and to ‘self-insert’ into stories to explore and deal with difficult dynamics and issues in real life, while yet others just read it because they enjoy the stories since they cater more to what girls enjoy rather than what can be found in popular media (which is watered down or entirely aimed at boys rather than girls).

If you stuck around until now, here is what I need help understanding and what most likely I have no business nosing around in:

I’m probably reading way too much into it and I’m cringing as I write but here goes… the fics she tends to bookmark and read are about an anime called My Hero Academia, and the two characters those fics focus on are Midoriya and Bakugou. I haven’t watched the anime at all but from what I can tell Midoriya is the classic well natured hero who is “a cinnamon roll” and just has positive interactions with everyone he is around but has confidence issues because he was bullied for being weak. Bakugou apparently is this hot-headed rival guy who is completely socially inept and treats everyone around him like ‘extras’ while thinking he is the best thing since sliced bread. He bullied Midoriya all through their childhood and most of the things these fics seem to explore is Bakugou coming to terms with him being a piece of shit while liking a person who is way out of their emotional league. Many of these fics are ‘tagged’ with things like ""rivals to friends to lovers,""  ‘forgiveness,’ ‘emotional constipation,’ ‘not really unrequited love,’ “unhealthy coping mechanisms’ etc…

Obviously I feel extremely conflicted about this… because I know I should have not stumbled upon it (particularly because so much of this deals with sexual fantasies too). Also, because I know she is still dating my friend and they still have a year left to trudge along before being reunited for good. I know I most likely should do nothing about it and act like I never saw anything, but I can’t help but to run laps in my own head. Am I the only one taking things seriously? Am I a nosy idiot? What do you make of it??? I can’t help but to think that it was a mistake to just roll over so easily when she needed support, but I also know that I am not the person to be there for her given everything that has happened (namely my inability to give proper support). I think it would be crossing an incredible line if I showed her boyfriend this or warned him about anything without even knowing for sure (also why I can’t easily talk about this with common friends).

I also think I need to find professional help for myself because this type of nosiness is surely not healthy, I've overstepped boundaries on too many occassions.",2020.0,5.0,31.0,06:17:25,victim,

Which started with me telling him he needs to wash his hands when he comes in the house especially with the virus that’s floating around and me being ill as it is, I have to be very careful because my immune system is super weak & beyond sensitive. I can’t afford to be more sick. Besides, washing your hands when entering anyone’s home is just basic hygiene, virus or no viruses and I asked him in a nice tone. He took that as me running my mouth & nagging him and I really wasn’t. 


He changes his clothes, crawls in bed, he didn’t wash his hands, he gets straight to eating with his bare hands and licking his fingers and I keep telling him to please go wash his hands. He becomes annoyed and I told him he is so fucking disgusting for eating without washing his hands. He then says I’m disgusting and starts throwing around all types of vicious insults saying my pussy stinks and that he only performs oral sex on me because he feels sorry for me.



The next morning we wake up, the very first thing that come out of his mouth is “what are you making me for breakfast ?” I’m like 😑 “why the hell would that be the first thing you ask me after the nasty way you spoke to me last night ?!” He said my love for him should always be unconditional. Not sure how that response correspond to my question, but whatever. I tried talking to him to find out what his real problem was because he couldn’t have been upset with me for asking him to wash his hands. He began talking over me, yelling at me, shutting me out because he didn’t want to listen to anything I had to say. He gets loud and beligerante and starts verbally abusing me while my family is listening to all the brutal things that he is saying. 



Then he yells, “if you want me to leave, tell me ! I have 6-7 other places I can go right now !” I didn’t want him leaving nor did I mention anything about him leaving. I was trying to figure out what hell his problem was so we can get to the bottom of it. He ended up leaving anyway. It seem like he was looking for a reason to leave because I did nothing to provoke this man.



I’ve been texting him and calling him and no response. After not hearing from him or seeing him in two days, I asked is he okay ? Where is he ? His response was “that’s nothing you need to concern yourself with” He then opens up to me about him feeling hurt because he found his his grandmother has stage 4 breast cancer and the one year anniversary of his uncle passing was a few days ago. My heart goes out to his grandmother because I am fighting cancer myself as we speak and he’s fully aware of my diagnosis and the hardships of my battle. I believe he’s using the tragedies of his family as an excuse to try to get away with being mean to me because that isn’t an excuse to lash out on me. If he told me this, I’ve would’ve consoled him, be there for him and help take away any pain that he was feeling. He then tells me he wants space and that he doesn’t know when he’ll talk to me again.


My mom says that his interest lies with someone else and doesn’t wanna be bothered with me anymore. He is using this tactic as an effort to get me to breakup with him so he can turn around and pin the blame on me as if I’m the one who walked out on him. And that he is only with me because he feels sorry for me because I’m sick for now. Once I begin healing and start regaining myself... and his fling with whomever fails, that’s when he’ll make an effort to try to return back into my life. That’s my mom’s analysis on the situation.

Please hear me out. 

After years of being put down in every way by my family I (26F) always maintained some distance. They don't know much about myself, my struggles, whom I'm dating, friends, etc. It has worked to an extent but my parents (67M/58F) and siblings (42F/38F/32M) have kept pressuring me to be more a part of the family. I have never felt any obligation to do so based on how they've treated me over the years.

I moved out with my partner, whom I have a very healthy relationship with. My stress is gone down to the point where my hair no longer falls out and I actually feel happy.

Last September I had a confrontation by family members essentially saying that I don't contribute to the family in a meaningful way and don't put in any effort. This was done in public by my brother's wife while everyone else looked on and didn't intervene. After this, I wrote a long message to all of them explaining that I am leaving the family and will not be talking to them moving forward. They have all tried in one  way or another tried to talk to me, but I've ignored all contact. I'm finally getting over it.

Last night my dad had a fall and ended up in the hospital. The doctors aren't sure why it happened and they needed to do some tests. My mom left me a voicemail with this information, and then kept trying to call me to come home for him. My brother called me from a private number to get me to pick up, and when I realized it was him within the first few seconds, I hung up. 

All of my family is toxic but I don't know how I feel about this. I'm a bit numb to the situation but the way I was raised is telling me I need to care. 

Social distancing aside, going to my parents house will achieve nothing until my dad is out of the hospital. And then what will happen? There is no happy family make up session that will happen after over 26 years of torture and abuse. If I go or reach out, I'm worried that they'll try to use this as an opportunity to weasel their way back onto my life and then criticize me for everything and talk down my partner. 

Is it alright that I stand my ground and not reach out? Am I bad person if I don't?

TL;DR - Abusive family (including dad) may try to wiggle their way back into my life if I reach out to see how my dad is doing. I don't want this to happen. Is it okay to stand my ground?

Edit: to everyone that commented thank you. I wanted to verify that I wasn't a bad person for not reaching out, and you all solidified that I wouldn't be. I'm going to keep my distance, rely on my partner for support, and try to keep my guilt from engulfing me. Thank you again everyone.",2020.0,4.0,28.0,10:17:41,victim,26

It all boiled down to me telling him and trying to convince him to see a therapist, wihich every time he end up calling and begging us to just take a break instead of me cutting him off completely. I have no idea how to control this guilt i have, and worry that I didnt do enough to try to support him through it. At this point, Ive posted so many times about him, I feel like a complete idiot and every time Im just stepping back from my progress. The last time out of many notes he's sent calling me names, blaming me for his depression, I finally tried to see if i could at-least see where his mind is at as far as processing things in relationships. I try to tell him I feel so codependent, and that he is too, in the most unhealthy way possible & i cant take care of myself, especially when he doesn't either, or offer any support on my end. His mom has cancer and abused his emotionally etc when he was younger, and he told me that he cant control his outbursts sometimes but he's doing all he can to try to keep himself stable (especially since he got really upset after i told him i wont stay with him in his house after testing positive, then negative after a while from the virus)

&#x200B;

He tells me that we're responsible for each-other, and that he needs that support from me, because i'm the only thing that can make him feel good/better and he's doing things on his own to control his thoughts. Although that may or may not be working, when i try to point out the horrible things he says to me when we argue, and how it goes way beyond JUST us, he tells me that the way ""I come at"" his mental health hurts him and thats its not okay. When I've tried every way to support him the best way i could for almost 2 years, i feel like he refuses to acknowledge the situations with his mom and just cant see how he literally blames, and yells at me the SAME way he talks about her. Its so beyond just a normal argument. Im not a professional and ive said that, but the things i try to convince him to do in at-least trying to see a new perspective or make myself healthier mentally, he says that ""im not a professional and that sending him links was disrespectful"".He says that he will not see a therapist bc he's not there yet (which i can respect) and that he doesn't want to talk with an outside person about anything bc its triggering for him bc of his mom. He also refuses to look into it bc he doesn't want to go talk to someone until he knows ""he has  money in the future and having money/wealth will make him feel better"" (hes not in the best situation as a young person financially and has zero support parentally/with family). He also said there are other reasons and that i truly dont listen to him, but in my eyes, when its hurting me too, his reasons are literally just words that have no substance or partials answers in them... its just things he says to me to explain why he acts the way he does...and i usually just take that..

 I feel like the whole time ive been staying, its like he tells me because were in a relationship that I should be there to help him through it.... even if my mental health is crumbling and i just don't think he's even stable or capable to ever support me in anything (even though i need nothing but simple words of assurance and encouragement). I try to explain to him the concept of being okay and stable on your own, before making an attempt to be in a relationship, and its just not a thing for him and says we can work on that together. I just feel like Im running out of fuel and i went as far as to send links like reading it from someone else will make me seem like less of a 'know it all' and he says that Im talking like someone who's a professional and not his gf. The last time he blamed me for wanting to hurt himself/addictions, etc. I had to stop coddling and straight up go at him with all that he says and apologizes for after (in these past 2 weeks). He says that I'm not there for him PHYSCIALLY when he needs it. After it all, and when i kept going back and forth in my progress after him calling from new numbers/emailing i caved and said we could take a break. Every time he speaks and i hear his thought processes i beat myself up and end up saying we need to break up for good. Now IM the one who's being manipulative after he calls me begging constantly not to do this to him and i just cant control my guilt. 

TLDR: EX says he cant control his emotions/thoughts and that I can be there to help him through it because hes working on it for himself too. When i do try and have, i just always feel its not enough and when i get angry i feel like its so full of resentment.  He refuses to acknowledge his trauma and says that I didn't know/dont know what it felt like with his mom in the house and how she treats him even tho she has cancer. I know its an incredibly painful experience but at this point I tell him he has no idea how much it hurts when he curses me out and says horrible things to me too. He says part of the reason he does that is because ""i dont accept his answers as answers, due to his past trauma or that ""hes working on it and tries so hard"". I clearly just cant make him see anything in our relationship or about himself, or that it effects me in a way I cant even describe. He makes me feel like im being selfish for leaving, or posting here when i feel like I'm just being stupid. On top of that, i never told my mom about him bc i was kind of embarrased ... and its always been a problem for me to sleep out at his house. And now i feel like if i had just done that and been honest with her, i could have had less issues being physically around him so he would feel like im not there enough physically no matter how much ive bent all my rules).. His last words to me were ""go fuck yourself"" once again. just out here clowning.. HAHA",2020.0,5.0,24.0,06:43:31,victim,

My sister is taking it surprisingly well, but I haven’t felt more hatred toward somebody in my life than I do towards him right now. My mother is very insecure and broken over this, and said she’s depending on me to which i responded i’d never leave her side and i would do as much as i could to help her with outdoor labor. Our neighbours are great friends with her too, which i’m very thankful for. He’s trying to make her feel guilty for all this too and telling me to man up while crying himself, so i don’t quite know if he knows what he’s getting himself into. me and him have had a rough relationship this past quarantine but he really sealed the deal here. i can’t believe him, telling me to “man up” when he is the one who needs to man up, leaving a 54 year old woman to fend for herself in this world after being married for about 20 years. i feel devastated, and i don’t really know how to handle the situation. 

tl;dr my dad is walking out on my 54 year old mother with a woman he met 6 months ago and trying to make himself feel better by putting her down. He wants to walk into the affair’s kids’ lives as a father figure and live with them, trying to justify it in any way he can.",2020.0,5.0,29.0,21:45:43,victim,17

Our families are close and eveybody has always said we would make a perfect couple. I agree and we have had a special connection with each other unlike other relationships.

He and I were both in a relationship when his ex had his baby daughter. She was a bad partner, she was abusive, an alcoholic, and she cheated on my boyfriend a ton. When they broke up, she abandoned her own daughter and left my boyfriend to care for her by himself. Then we started dating.

We’ve been together for a year now and I love him so much and I love his daughter. It’s just that recently, I asked him if we could have a kid of my our own soon, but he said to give him some time to finish up college and find a higher paying job. I get it, but he didn’t think about any of that when he gave his ex a daughter, which she doesn’t even care for.

Then I feel guilty because when I see his daughter now, I basically see his ex since she looks a lot like her and it’s like a bad reminder of his choices of having a baby with her and how she had treated him. I feels bad because she treated him like shit and he gave her a daughter while we have something special and he wants to wait

. What can I do to make things better and so I could stop feeling so negative towards her and him for what he said? I don’t want ti have anger with her because she is just a baby and didn’t do anything to me.

688,79,182,My gf (F20) of 2 years serious relationship broke up with me (M22) with no real valid reason other than she just didnt want to be with me.. confusion ensues,1.0,gwfdc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gwfdc6/my_gf_f20_of_2_years_serious_relationship_broke/,8.0,1591297663.0,"I'll try to add as much context as possible without droning on too much. As always TLDR at the bottom but i recomend reading all of this as there is too much context and the relationship was never simple.

2 years relationship. Met on tinder. Had anniversaries, birthdays, holidays etc. Everything was not perfect but we were strong to work through everything that came our way. Discussed longterm plans, kids, living together; all comfortable no real lifestyle disagreements.

Background on her. Her self esteem was always in question. Lacked confidence and due to family being extremely strict, she couldnt be very independent.  friends all went to university bar a few close ones and she started to feel isolated. In a way she was very emotionally dependant on me which I was fine with. Her work life was physically Intensive and had to travel far and I did my best to help her through it e.g waking up 6 hours early to travel with her to work st 4am when I had to go.into the office for 9Am then meeting with her afterwards to grab a coffee and a cuddle etc. Due to my job being extremely flexible I was always able to make time for her easily. 

Deep down I understood she was a little bit unstable and needed constant support but I worked through it.

Her mum did not accept me, had bad mental health issues, on probably all the anti depressants and was extremely controlling. E.g. she had a curfew even when she was staying over at my place if she didnt do as her mum stated she would throw abuse at her and threaten her, she always folded eventually.

 I worked with it, I loved her allot in fact within our relationship she grew more independant and didnt take the shit as much as she used to. Her mums abuse led her to breakdown many times... it was heartbreaking  hard to see... 
 There were many incidents where her mum really showed her hate for me, shouting, cussing complaining that im taking her away from her etc. It made me feel very uncomfortable and I tried to avoid spending time at her place so we would either always go out or just head to mine for privacy  chilling etc.

She didnt want to move out for the next 3-5 years because she disnt believe she could afford her lifestyle  on a £20k retail salary...

Her dream was to get into performance arts but because of monetary issues and how she had a growth in her foot that really affected her walking she couldnt achieve what she wanted so that was constantly weighing in on her.

Sex was very touch and go, she had allot of insecurities  and I know I was a little bit demanding as I had a high sex drive. She wasnt experienced and had a bad history with her ex using her for sex and emotionally abusing her but over time she opened up more. There wasnt any attraction issues bar how she just wouldnt really head into foreplay which I compramised on.

She was the kindest soul and even those who hurt her she would try and keep in her life which I understood but sometimes at times it also seemed very childish. Again I worked through it.

Comes the lockdown. (Her stability decreased even more calling me multiple times a day to get reassured that she didnt have corona virus)

I tried my best to support her to get her out the house reconcile, trying to be there etc.

Now 2 weeks ago comes our main argument this year. She calls me telling me that she decided to get back in contact with her abusive ex because she wanted to keep him in her life as they had allot of history together.

We decided earlier on in the relationship to be respectful and block out our exs. So from my perspective It made me feel super uncomfortable.

Another excuse was that apparently she wanted access to her exs social circle rather than try and make new friends and that her ex was the key to her social happiness. I tried to talk it out but she was adamant and stubborn.

Our communication broke down as I felt betrayed but a week after we worked things out and she decided to compramise and just block him as long as I would help her socialise go out etc. Even before this I noticed that she was craving being social so as before I did my best to  get out of the house and just help her network with my social group, go to clubs to meet new people. She never really tried or took advantage of this...

The next few days things were slowly getting back to how they were, we even had a social distancing picnic and were very intimate, she started crying on me saying how she wished I could always remain by her side and how she wanted to move in with me asap to just move forward from where she was in life, she loved me etc. it was a heartwarming moment that really showed me how much she meant to me but also showed me how this lockdown took such a toll on her. I did my best to support her in any way I could but also giving her the space she needed.

3 days later she starts to get really distant her replies get really cold, I try to give her some space as usually this meant that she had an argument with her mum. I send her a supporting message telling her how much I love her and that whatever is going on everything will work out in time etc.

Now 2 days ago, which was now the 4th day of her being cold and short with me she sends me one text message consisting of 2 sentences. ""After thinking the past few days. I've decided I dont want to be with you anymore""

I'm shocked, dont really know how to take it, start panicking thinking she might be suicidal (similar situation happened beforehand where she gave up on life).

I try calling her like 10 times and she hangs up on me every time. So then I calmly ask her for context over text for a reason. She replies with ""you always stay Inside and I want to see my friends"". Which confuses me even more because 1. During this whole coronaviris lockdown I was always trying to go out with her, do jogging go on picnics or just hang out etc even before this lockdown she was the one who always blew off her friends and never wanted to go out. 2. I never ever told her she could not see any of her friends, male female I didnt care who she went out with as long as it just wasnt her ex. In my mind the guy abused her and it ticked me off.

She just closes off at this point and asks me to pick up my things which I do. She didnt want to talk in person about it as she was content with her decision. As I was waiting for her uber her best friend (female) just sat down next to her and they were casually chatting.

I was never controlling or demanding, I compramised and sacrificed allot for her... we worked through so much and were so close knit that I was even thinking of surprising her with a trip to Paris in winter I would propose to her with an engagement ring. (Trust me it wasnt rushing it things settled down quickly and she was even giving me hint after hint).

So here I am. 2 days later.. removed from all social media (which goes against her whole ohh I want to keep everyone in my life). All my things thrown back at me in black bags, promise ring, really intimate and beautiful pictures, tickets from shows and holidays, all the teddy beats I gave her, birthday presents jewelery... and no closure. She closed off completely... 

she fidnt block me on mobile but I've had experience with messy breakups before and texting her over and over when it's clear she wants nothing to do with me I know not to bother...


The most hurtful part was that when I did come over to pick up my things her facial expression was emotionless. She wouldnt make eye contact and didnt even look like she even cried. It was cold.. the coldest thing I've experienced.

So yeah. I dont know how to even handle this. Emotionally I'm confused. I feel hurt, betrayed, I want to blame myself but looking back especially what she said.. its just wrong, it doesn't make any sense. The worst part is that deep down I know that I wont get closure from this and that I'm just going to have to put it all behind me. I really was ready to commit all the way. I want to cry it out pbut I just feel broken. How can a person who you believed loved you so much could hurt you this badly..

Idk why I'm posting here as this is more of a rant than a real queerie or typical relationship case study for you guys.

Any advice on this? I downloaded tinder and it's nice to talk to people  but I'm not really one to sleep around, old fashioned values. Even afterwards I'm.still in pain, I dint think I'm truly depressed but even after playing games with the lads on CoD or talking with familly, friends the pain still creeps back. I know its only been a few days but I'm really struggling here.

Recently, she  told me she wants to leave her partner ('Ben' M27) of 7 years, but can't because:

&#x200B;

1. Ben is her first - fear of being alone;
2. feels like used goods - she thinks others will see her as undesirable;
3. Purchased a house with him 3 years ago - not married, but parents helped with mortgage. She feels pressured to stay.
4. there have been talks of marriage;
5. they share the same friend group, all met through uni/college;
6. parents like him as he is from a similar affluent background to her, private schooled, wealthy family, etc.

Ben is emotionally and verbally abusive. I've told her this from the very beginning of their relationship. Ben is a lawyer, and makes it known to everyone he meets. He is very harsh with his words. He also makes good money - they both do but he's just emotionally and verbally battered her.  Not too sure about physical abuse - however she has told me he is quite violent during sex. A couple years into their relationship she was coerced into getting an abortion.  During this relationship, I've seen Julia develop depression and anxiety. She's recently told me she's bisexual - she had developed feelings for a female co-worker but left it as that - she did not act on it. But apparently, this co-worker was the kindest soul she had met, and without knowing made her life a bit better and brighter.  One a side note this co-worker was opposite to Ben - female for starters, but v humble and kind, soft-spoken, from a blue-collar family who was saving up for university/college. Nothing came of this, ever, as they both left the company. 

Reddit I need some advice, what can she do? And honestly, I can't advise her bc I've never been in a relationship at all. Personally, I think she settled and should have left the troll 3 years into the relationship.

691,82,188,Verbal bullying,3.0,gx0pls,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gx0pls/verbal_bullying/,4.0,1591374736.0,"When I(F25) was young, my dad was always busy as a human resource manager and my mom was a 24/7 housewife so I stayed with her most of the time. She was always on her phone either playing games or watching comedies which built up huge distances with me all my childhood. She loved me but also being mad at me at the same time as I’m not very smart, pretty, and quite slow-witted, have a few “abnormal behaviors” (which i believe because i was restricted to any kind of outdoor activities without her). As a typical Asian family, my mom whooped my ass and yelled at me everyday for any reason. However, sometimes the punishment went too far because she lost her temper and my body was full of bruises. And I realize that she yelled at me not always about what I did wrong but she told me how ashamed I should be about my unperfected appearance and intelligence. 

My friends always used me and were mean to me which I don’t understand (because I’m slow-witted). Things got worse when I attended a high school where a lot of rich, mean, spoiled kids study at. They used and abuse me verbally then even spread the rumor that I’m a lesbian. I also hear the rumor that i’m pregnant but the lesbian one was more famous.

My family sent me to America when I was 17 and I thought the bullying was over when I attended to Catholic school and lived apart from my mom. However, I lived in a state where the asian community is not huge so racism is everywhere. I reached my breaking point when my white classmates from theology class who sat around me pretend like I don’t exist and showed the “disgusting” face when accidently having physical contact with me: my asian friend (we both came from the same country around the same time) used and (just like my mom) talked me down especially when I failed to pleasure her for prolonged time since we lived together so I can’t get rid of her right away (she’s like the worst of the worst). Once I thought about ripping off my yellow skin. 

I moved in with a lady and her family that my grandma had a really good relationship with but they had sarcastic attitudes and comments about how i live. Finally, I flew to another state and moved in with my dad, my sister and her family.

I attempted to commit suicide serveral time (one happened recently and most are when i lived with my mom). None of them ever happened even when the death drive is high because when I almost grabbed a knife or sank my head in the water, there is a voice try to calm me down and we’re talking and talking until I went back to “normal”

Actually, I don’t want to post this but I stuck at home (due to the quarantine) and kept recalling those awful memories like every week or every two weeks which trigger death drive

TL;DR I was verbally bullied in my whole life and felt numb which made me almost commit suicide a few time. 

How can I overcome this or at least stop thinking about these moments or what should I tell myself when the next time I attempt to kill myself (because I notice that in the recent attempt, the voice became very weak and not convincing anymore which the death drive is extremely high)?",2020.0,6.0,5.0,22:17:16,victim,24
692,83,189,36f - looking for advice on biggest decision of my life,1.0,gm1s4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gm1s4l/36f_looking_for_advice_on_biggest_decision_of_my/,26.0,1589838522.0,"TLDR:  I am a 36f who has a decision to make and needs advice. I was offered a job in CA. My other option is to stay in NH with my bf (30m). I need to choose by August. Both places offer what I want and need, in different ways. 

It’s hard to write about what makes this a tough decision, so I’m going to break it down into four sections: No Family, Difficult Year, CA and NH.

NO FAMILY: 
My family members are narcissistic and have borderline personality disorder. For those of you who are not familiar with these things, congratulations. Basically these are people who have an evil and warped view of life, can’t keep their own emotions in check, need to use people to feel better about themselves and want to hurt others who can experience true happiness and show empathy, as they cannot. My sisters and (now deceased) mom have tried to hurt or kill me repeatedly, my entire life, and my father has stood by to watch this happen, and excuse it, because “that’s how they are”. I worry about the legitimacy of identity theft threats, or simply being cast out of the family as crazy as that sounds. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized the latter is a gift. I was thrown out of the family when I was 16 for trying to get them help, after my mom repeatedly tried to kill me. I was a smart and kind kid who lost all of her options to attend a good college early in life as a result of this family. I dropped out of high school in a final attempt to save my siblings from my mentally ill mom. As a result, I was kicked out of the family and seen as tearing them apart (they were tearing each other apart). 

My family did not contact me for years, and my father told me to stay away. I put myself through college with my GED and lived in terrifying neighborhoods I could barely afford and navigated through times where I was abused by other apartment tenants. I chose to go into education instead of medicine because medicine was too much of a risk and too expensive for someone with nothing and no high school education. Despite all this, I kept a 4.0 GPA. I worked hard and made something out of nothing, all alone. I worked for some of the best schools in the country without ever having gone to high school. I have helped hundreds of students in the course of my career as a result of having nobody to confide in as a child, and wanting to be that stable presence for them that I never had.

When my mom died, my dad found me and told me to come home as he had nobody to take care of the kids. I was so excited to have a family, but that experience was a nightmare in which I was called names constantly, physically abused and made to take responsibility for anyone’s evil behavior towards each other. And now I was to blame for my mom dying, too. So I left again. My experience with family has always been fleeting in this sense.

I have been both the sucker and scapegoat of this family my entire life. I have fluctuated between trying to help them in times of need, and being intentionally hurt, manipulated and blamed for their abuse as a result of their mental illness and extreme dislike of themselves and life in general. I have had to do everything myself and am poor as a result. I had tremendous student loans to pay off and no financial security. I paid those loans off last year and am now able to consider saving for retirement and even buying a house one day, if it isn't too late in my life to consider that. This was only made possible bc I worked my butt off.

Seven years ago, I decided to reconnect with my father. He was older and I’m sure he needed help that the rest of my family would not provide. Sure enough, my siblings have grown to embody the greed and selfishness and manipulation they were raised in, despite my efforts to help as a teen. And they blame me for all of it, because I “abandoned them”. They swarm around him and demand money, and often steal it straight from his bank account. He wants me around in old age because I am kind and don't use him, and is now the one being abused, but will not stand up to them or even identify their behavior as wrong. If I stick around too much, I get blamed for all of it and some of the blame gets taken off of him. No wonder why he wants me around.

I want a family of my own that is peaceful, kind, logical, trustworthy, honest, funny and reliable. That is the #1 thing I want. People want most what they did not always have.

DIFFICULT YEAR: 
Sometimes when a person is used to mistreatment, they stay in places too long that are abusive. I was married for a short time to a man who took my hearing from physical abuse. I dated a guy who cheated on me behind my back compulsively. I have worked for employers with toxic leadership where I was under-appreciated, overworked and bullied. My life has been a lot of hard work, personal success and treating people with kindness - I do not regret any of that. It has also been littered with a few shitty relationship decisions. 

Here is a list of what happened this year:

* Left a very prestigious education job in a big southern city, uncertain if I'd be coming back. Liked my work but it was not a healthy environment to work in. Lots of workplace bullying. I wanted to explore other career options and possibly go back to school. Not possible - they kept me too busy.
* Spent the summer in CO, hoping to start a life there. Moved out to be with a long distance boyfriend who told me he wanted to start a family and help me get back to school. All of that was a lie. Discovered he was a wolf in sheep's clothing, a narcissist and abuser. From day one, he reminded me of my mom. I soon learned why. I was all alone in the middle of nowhere to endure it. He berated and punished me most days. I knew I had to get out but at the same time found myself apologizing constantly. Holy crap, this is what battered woman syndrome is. I’ve played that role my entire life. I was too old and self-accomplished to play it again, but here I was. 
* Moved back to New England. My father begged me to come home. My (second most) mentally ill sister was having brain surgery and he couldn’t handle that himself. I felt bad and fell victim to the old “help us, we will appreciate you as the kind daughter you are” game. Quit my prestigious job since he needed me, and I didn't want to work in an unhealthy environment ... yet I stepped into an even less healthy one.
* Lived in a hospital for a month while sister had surgeries, yelled at our elderly dad constantly (who slept in his car each night) and conspired against doctors who were ""all out to get her"".
* Moved her back home to RI, considered reporting her for elderly abuse (until she threatened me with identity theft). Moved out of the house when she physically attacked me for standing up for my dad after she yelled at him all day (as usual) and broke his ankle. My dad did nothing as I stood up for him and she attacked me.  
* Made a firm decision not to talk to my family ever again, outside of my dad. Realized mental health and kindness were non-negotiables in life. Wondered about even keeping in contact with him.
* Had no job/income but found emergency residence in CT. I roomed with meth heads. Incredibly terrifying. I went from having some sort of professional career, to this. 
* Visited my old job. Learned an ex-coworker was saying terrible things about me so they could take my job. Was now afraid everything I poured my heart into was in vain and my future career options would be nixed. Decided I wanted nothing to do with toxic work cultures ever again.
* Moved to NH to take a job beside the prettiest part of the Appalachian Trail. Job paid nothing but offered housing, food and life beside my favorite forest. I hiked the AT years back and considered this part my spiritual home. I wanted to go there to heal. Upon taking job, met a lot of amazing people. Loved it. Met my new boyfriend.
* Got laid off. COVID. Entire world closed. No connections in NH. Lost my housing and food. Knew nobody. Now homeless.
* Did not (and still do not) qualify for unemployment since I got paid so little.
* Boyfriend took me in. He lived in a backwoods cabin. We lived in a remote forest during the pandemic. No heat, electricity, or running water, but tons of stars and snow. So beautiful.
* In March, I was offered a job in San Francisco, which I did not turn down. Keeping options open is a good thing. I really liked my boyfriend and hated the idea of leaving him. Let's see where this goes.
* Had some pretty traumatic female health problems. Traumatic, and took awhile to diagnose and treat with COVID shutdown, but my boyfriend helped me through it. That taught me a lot about his character.

CALIFORNIA: The job in California is a continuation of a prestigious career. If I don’t take this job now, I may not be able to continue that career later in life. I’ve already taken one year away from it and am fortunate to have that offer. The job might also have crappy leadership, and I might be overworked or not appreciated as a result. Being overworked will limit my options to go back to school and get other degrees to help me work in a different field, but the prestigious environment can also allow me a way to make good connections with influential people and do other things - publish books, for instance, become an author, help others in a significant, global way. The salary is livable and also offers great benefits, like health and retirement. I don’t have much retirement at all, as I had so many student loans to pay off. This can help me get on my feet. I also need to consider relationships. I'd miss my partner incredibly.

I have had such a horrific childhood and a couple scary adult relationships, but I am a relationship-centered person by nature, so having a healthy family of my own is THE most important thing to me. I was not happy in a big city because I did not have a partner and dating life was based more on Tinder expectations than anything mature and lasting. The cost of living is so high in CA. I’d spend a few years there but most likely not settle down, save up money and finally buy a house somewhere different, later on. It’s always been a dream of mine to live in California. I am 36, so I’m not getting any younger, attractive, richer or mobile. My window for opportunities will decrease in these ways.

NEW HAMPSHIRE: Educators in NH get paid significantly lower than CA, although the cost of living is also lower. There aren't prestigious schools like the ones I have worked for. I wish I didn't have to care about these things. I am currently living in a beautiful land beside the Appalachian Trail I hiked a few years ago. I called this forest my home, a deep home in my soul. Unfortunately, the surrounding towns are small and don’t offer much in terms of community, culture or work and are also sometimes overtly racist, which will make teaching difficult. COVID makes job searching pretty impossible. I am emailing every private school out here in search of work and looking for jobs every day. This is the absolute best place, in my mind, to settle down with a life partner. It is peaceful, serene, and hundreds of miles of trails to run, hike and fall in love with every day. This would be the place for that phase of my life. 

My boyfriend would be the main reason I’d stay here. I love him a lot. His life speaks to me in an intimate way. He too hiked the Appalachian Trail, and decided to leave a very 'respectable' career to work in the woods (which is much more 'respectable' by my standards). He works between two seasonal jobs and loves it. Does not make much money. Does not need to. He has parents that actually cared and planned for him so he is better off, financially, than I am and probably will ever be. He mentioned he also wants something serious relationship-wise and at this point he wants someone who is ""along for the ride"", and it's a good ride. I can see myself being happy on this ride. Eventually that ride will set himself up for a career that is more stable. He has connections and is getting there. But I don't want to be his partner simply bc I signed up for the ride. I want to be the one person he chooses for that ride. I don't want to be the most convenient option. Practically speaking, my schooling will never allow me the stability he is carving out for himself in that specific field. Living with him in low-cost arrangements could allow me to slowly go back to school, whereas the career in CA might keep me too busy to even try. 

It would make me so happy to have someone to care for, who cares back, someone to create an honest and happy home/family with. That makes me happiest in life. But not with just anyone. The largest portion of what would keep me in NH would be him. I love him a lot for who he is as a person. He has not told me he loves me back, and that in itself could be what helps me decide to go to CA instead. We have differences that matter. I (probably stupidly) believe in fate, he does not. He is not sentimental, but I am. I love being with him so much. I can imagine my life without him, but really don’t want to. I think he is a kind, stable, highly intelligent and dedicated man. I am proud of him and think he is a kind and humane person to others. I love spending time with him. I think he deserves someone stable and kind and funny in return. 

I don’t know how he feels about me, but he has said in the past that he is not great about talking about his feelings, and also that we are getting to know each other, so clearly maybe we are in different places with regards to how we feel. I hate that, but that is life. With COVID and the female health scare we dealt with early on, things have been going really fast. I guess sometimes life does this, but I also see those times as good tests. We both are still very good together, which speaks volumes. I am scared to have serious conversations about me potentially moving across the country during a time where we probably just need to have fun and enjoy each other's company and learn about each other. 

He mentioned previously that his life is in NH. He has spent so many years crafting it, so that is a true statement. I want a partner for life and can see him as being that person. He has worked hard to create something I could settle into, but a huge part of this equation is how he feels about me and how he will see a future for us. I don't know how long it will take him to have that answer for himself, how long it would take him to realize if he wants me to settle in with him here, or how he regards the existence of other women in his life. I will definitely be leaving a successful career with opportunities of its own, opportunities I worked hard for, if I choose to stay here. That would not faze me in the slightest if this relationship is true. My future family is more important than the prestige of my career. I am used to disappointment in relationships and sometimes choosing (very) poorly. I don't want to place myself in a situation where I am not respected or appreciated as much as I should be in the long run. 

I need to know what he wants and needs and respect those things in return. I know how I feel about him. The last thing I want to do is be in a place where I feel like I am holding someone else back or making them feel resentful deep down because they are in a situation they don't want or aren't ready for. I think ultimately I need to know we are on the same page emotionally and maturity-wise. Maybe that won't happen in time but I think I need to be clear about my options and that need.

Looking for some advice in all of this. I am a kind person who just wants a peaceful, kind, stable life in return where I can love my partner. I feel that this is one of the most important decisions I will ever have to make in life. I don't want to be looking back on my life at 80 and regretting what I chose.",2020.0,5.0,19.0,03:33:42,victim,36

Should she move out and am i crazy for keeping this relationship going. 

Help reddit.

I feel like I'm losing my best friend

My girlfriend and I are both 19. We've been together for the past 5 years since freshman year of highschool. Now we are 2 years out of highschool. I am studying STEM at a local university and she is working retail and has plans to move away for veterinary college next fall. We've agreed that we want to spend the rest of our lives together. 

She has severe depression. I think it stems from her families attitude towards her, and a regular amount of mental abuse she got from her parents (namely her mom - things like guilt tripping, shaming, and backing out of promises). My girlfriend has some health issues too. She has severe scoliosis on which she has been waiting for a surgery for the last couple of years (the main reason she didn't go to college right after highschool). The scoliosis causes frequent muscle and bone aches. Her organs being squished has affected her diet and regularly gives her pains. She was told that if she doesn't get the scoliosis surgery then she won't live past 36. She also gets non epileptic seizures from stress related issues

I live with my parents, she lived with hers until last august. That was when we got a dog. My girlfriend loves animals and has always wanted a dog. A week after getting our dog, her mom told her that she cant stand the dog and that either she moves out or they get rid of the dog (this was after her mom agreeing that she could get a dog. Her mom does shit like that all of the time). So she moved out and went to go live with her grandparents with our dog. 

Her grandparents have some issues. They are hoarders, they are narcissists, they smoke like chimneys in the house to the point that everything smells like nicotine. They live in a two floor apartment in a complex that has a load of other issues (noisy neighbors, bad landlord, neighboring units have had cockroach problems). The grandma in particular can flip from perfectly normal to enraged over nothing in a matter of seconds. 

I know that she has been affected quite negatively by living with her grandparents in this isolated environment where often she's walking on eggshells with her grandparents. It definitely wasn't like this when she first moved in but things have gotten worse and worse. 

My girlfriend started using weed regularly since she moved out of her parents place. First for fun and because friends around her were doing it. I enjoy it with her sometimes too. Lately though i know that she's been using it to numb out her mental pain, and because its just something to do. 

I have tried my best to be beside her and to help her through all of this. I truly love her like no other, and despite all of the issues that surround her I truly want to be with her and fantasize about the day when she'll be able to put her past behind her and we'll be able to move on with our life together. I'm a very positive person by my own nature. I'm quite healthy and have a lot of energy that i devote to helping her. 

I now try to see her every single night so that she doesn't have to be alone. Lately I've taken to helping her with dishes and cleaning and laundry at her own place, to take some of that load off of her. I take our dog out regularly to get him excersize when she is hurting too much to take him out on walks. She doesn't have a ton of hobbies at the moment but tries to stay busy when she is feeling up for it mentally and physically. We tried to do drop in weekly therapy sessions which wete helping, but then covid happened and has put a stop to that for now. 

At the moment she is looking for opportunities to move out into her own apartment with our dog. Its not something that she would be able to entirely afford on her own with her part time income, so i plan to supplement half because the way i see it, its an investment in her mental health and in our future. I can afford it with my income from internships which is good.

I think its a fantastic idea for her to move out because it will give her a lot more control over the situation around her, and i think it would be a chance for her to stand up a little rather than just being kicked down again.
But then again, im also worried what will happen if things don't quite work out. If increased isolation and a financial burden will mean that moving out will do more harm than good.

We have fairly free and open communication, although she tends to close up when she is feeling more depressed and open up when she isn't as depressed. Right now is one of those more depressed times and honestly it's been like this for a month now.I try to keep it all positive but not all of that positivity breaks through.

I need advice because i dont exactly know which way we should go from here. In about a years time we hope that she will move away for school and i think that this will be a good step in the right direction towards her healing. But thats in a year and I'm seeing things getting worse on the weekly basis. 

Is it a good idea to move ahead woth moving out, or do you think that it will just be a situation that will do more harm than good?

Am i crazy for wanting to go on with this relationship? I truly love her and i know that she does truly love me. I promised to her a long time ago that our love is forever, and i truly want that to be so. She is a wonderful person with a lot of desirable human traits. Unfortunately she has been dealt a bad hand by her environment where everything just kicks her down. She enjoys working even if her job is a bit boring. I see that her mental state improves after she gets out of the house to work. That's what gives me hope that her mental state may improve if the environment changes. 

I know that if i were to tell her that im having second thoughts about our relationship it would destroy all of her self esteem.",2020.0,5.0,21.0,07:29:34,victim,19
694,85,192,Methods of quelling or reducing jealousy,5.0,ge6t9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ge6t9x/methods_of_quelling_or_reducing_jealousy/,27.0,1588743658.0,"I've read through several posts here about jealousy and they don't really fit what I want to ask. I'm a 30yrs man and because of recent issues with my wife (32f) I randomly and irrationally get huge spikes of jealousy that either have me sobbing (privately) or staring at a wall while the intense feeling pulses through my neck, chest, and stomach. Honestly I'd rather be dead, it's too much for me. I can't focus on work or entertainment when I start feeling jealous, just the wall.

My wife knows how I feel but she reasonably does not want to have to reassure me considering our issues, and I completely understand. The logic part of my brain also doesn't want her to do that. I know the jealousy would go away if I always knew what she was doing, where she was going, and who she's talking to but I know better than to even politely suggest that. These feelings are very new to me, they only started in light of our issues. Those are very controlling attributes and I am not even sure I could act that way if she told me it didn't bother her. I'm not interested in snooping (never) or talking about it with her (anymore), at this point it shouldn't be something she has to deal with.

Is there anything that is otherwise well-known to have a somewhat decent success rate in putting a dent in this? I know everyone is different, but trying anything is better than nothing. I've tried slow breathing, I've tried writing it out, I've tried typing into an anonymous blog, I've tried screaming into a pillow

**TL;DR:** idk how to summarize it better than the heading but the rules say not to say that, so I guess: I'm having jealousy spikes I can't prevent or stop, I can't talk to my wife about them, help

**Edit:** (squeezing this in at the top, after having written this edit, to say I did describe these issues in another sub two weeks ago and completely forgot, in my profile it's the post right under this one)

First, I guess, thank you. I came into the sub at the very most expecting suggestions that I would have whole-heartedly tried but without very much hope, but instead received new things to consider. Knowing that these may be anxiety/panic attacks is incredibly helpful and I've taken steps to pre-load common areas with herbal supplements that may take the edge off until I can visit my doctor. I'll also seek therapy.

To my knowledge she did not cheat, but her behaviors suggested to me that she was preparing herself to either have an affair or just leave me. I don't know how to describe this with a short summary so I'm sorry for what's about to follow, but you wanted more information so here's more information. She was telling other people that she was unhappily remarried, and making vague considerations to them about leaving our town, while instead telling me her depression spells were from continuing to struggle through emotional turmoil from a couple of family tragedies and the end of her first marriage. She had been lying to me for over a year, and the longer we went the more she resented me for things I had absolutely no idea about. We did not argue very often before this, there is no yelling, physical, or emotional abuse. We had always, to my knowledge, kept communication as open as possible, but it turns out that there were many habits, behaviors, and ways I expressed myself that really bothered her, things I could have then and have since easily modified with a little bit of practice. They were not huge personality traits that I would have had to lie to myself and to others about, but definitely things that if you were against may really affect your opinion of a person. Other than the obvious her not telling me important things, when we did have discussions it also turns out we were not as good at communicating as I thought. But.. we've since made positive progress in that regard. It's still not perfect, but it's better. I still do not know everything she resents about me, every now and then I can convince her to talk about it with me but after 15 to 30 minutes of discussion she says she gets overwhelmed, and then she shuts down and doesn't (can't?) pay attention.

Since January of this year she has resolved to ""focus on herself,"" she said she felt she lost sight of who she was and is ""trying to feel like herself again"" (those are in quotes only because I don't exactly understand what that means, not out of air-quote sarcasm or snark). She goes out with friends she's made since moving here instead of staying home and staring at her phone (depression). She exercises regularly now to combat her depression, and to go along with all of this she has stopped hugging me, stopped seeking my attention at all, we no longer have sex whereas sex was relatively regular before this and was something we both initiated, not just me. We sleep in separate rooms now. She used to seek my attention and want to cuddle and now she hasn't done that since before July of last year (I know this because I remember how our anniversary went).

So to recap, all through 2018 and 2019 she suffered depression episodes, gradually stopped seeking my attention or my affection, telling me it wasn't me but she is losing her desire for those things at all. By just before 2019 she stops seeking any affection at all, September 2019 was the last time we had sex, January 2020 I find out what she's told others and by the end of January she resolved to focus on herself.

All of these behaviors were red flags of having an affair to me, despite how serious she's always taken her commitments and how much it didn't make sense, that's what I thought. I don't think that anymore. What I am afraid of is that she wants to divorce but doesn't want to lose my financial support; that we're going to have this no affection, no love, platonic roommate relationship until she falls into an affair without seeking one (irrational) or until an opportunity presents itself where she can leave me without fear of uncertainty.

At the very same time, though, she isn't being rude or mean. She's not ignoring me or saying hurtful things. She's actually still very considerate towards me, and if she hasn't witnessed me having eaten anything she'll text and make sure (I used to work chaotic hours and would skip meals for convenience. That was two years ago, I haven't skipped a meal since but she still makes sure). On the one hand she is very annoyed when I express my relatively newfound insecurity and when I try to be affectionate, so I do not bring them up to her anymore and I do not touch her (few months now), on the other hand she is being more than just polite towards me. So it appears she really is just focusing herself and rebuilding her identity and self-image, and not compromising that with what she feels are dependant behaviors.

But it leaves my needs for affection completely unfilled. I do my best to support her self-finding, self-fulfillment goals by trying to not be a needy obstacle, but I am starved for affection. I urge to touch her and to be touched by her, even non-sexually, and in the past if she let me (IF) she stared at her phone zoning out and didn't participate. That on top of wondering why she didn't come to me years ago, why she was more comfortable telling others instead of the one person that could have started trying to fix them, as if she was afraid of my response, as if I've ever reacted aggressively or intentionally dismissed or invalidated her emotions.

Anytime I feel even a faint whisper of loneliness, I start finding it odd she suddenly just doesn't need affection anymore, so my mind wanders to where she could be getting it, and I can't stop it. It leads to the words ""unhappily remarried"" replaying over and over in my head, and then anything she does that doesn't directly involve me or consider me sets off what I described as intense, mind-numbing jealousy, but what you guys have taught me is, or is probably, an anxiety attack. Today a mutual friend of ours turned on the stereo to show her a 70s Zeppelin song he liked, a genre she has never expressed interest in, and she loved it (as she should have) and they shared that moment together. I was in the other room now hearing all of that, staring at wall wishing for death, my pulse thumping against my throat and stomach.

Everything that triggers these are things emotionally abusive and inappropriately controlling spouses react to, things that never bothered me in my relationships before and that I've criticized other guys in the past for. I assume it never bothered me because she actively sought my attention and affection at least once during the day and I felt important to her, so ""what would I have to worry about?""",2020.0,5.0,6.0,11:25:58,victim,30
695,86,193,I (22F) want to leave my boyfriend (22M) as I suspect he cheated on me with the same girl who started “rumors” of him cheating on me with her - if that isn’t obvious,19.0,gx9rg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gx9rg0/i_22f_want_to_leave_my_boyfriend_22m_as_i_suspect/,3.0,1591409501.0,"I (22F) just think my relationship with my boyfriend (22M) has run its course. 

Long story short, I heard he cheated on me months ago with a girl that was his ex. We have been together for five years, so obviously that stung. I kept hearing things she was saying blah blah.. it’s a small town. I believed other people, my friends, and moved out and in with a friend. He was in North Carolina on a hunting trip at the time so when he got back I was gone. 

Eventually we talked things out. We got back together. But I don’t feel I can trust that he didn’t cheat. I’m trying to be a more forgiving person but I can’t stop thinking about this. I dream about it constantly. He swears he didn’t, yet he slept in his mother’s basement one night with this girl after we broke up and says that he didn’t even touch her. Apparently he can’t remember what conversation took place. That night I basically broke back into our house, was waiting for him until my friend found me and brought me back home. And he decided to go hangout with her instead to apparently talk about these rumors. Which leads me to believe it’s true. 

Plain and simple - I don’t trust him. I do think something happened and he just got caught. I think I’m being manipulated. I don’t really want to have sex with him anymore. I don’t really want to see him anymore. I just want to be alone. 

But how do I do this? I have no family. They were abusive. I don’t want to involve friends. I go to college in the fall. I have two dogs and a cat I can’t bear to part with and hardly any money saved up since I spent most of it on school already. 

I really need an adults advice for once. I don’t have that luxury right now. I want to leave and be on my own and find someone someday that I can trust. That’s not happening right now. 

How do I do this? I live in VT by the way. I apologize if this isn’t the right community.

TLDR; I’m (22F) pretty much done with the lying and manipulation I’ve had with my boyfriend (22M) and have no idea how to get away from this with very little support",2020.0,6.0,6.0,07:56:41,victim,22
696,87,194,My 13 year old niece moved in with me possibly just to access social media and bad friends and it's hurting my marriage.,1.0,gv6de1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gv6de1/my_13_year_old_niece_moved_in_with_me_possibly/,16.0,1591129500.0,"My 13 year old niece has lived with a family friend for the past 10 years basically because her mom (my sister) wasn't able to care for her- unstable income, night jobs, criminal activities, etc. 

The family friend provided everything and more- dance lessons, art lessons, guitar lessons, tutoring, homework help, etc., and in return she did pressure my niece to make really good grades and kept control of no social media, no sleeping over at peoples houses if she doesn't fully trust those friends, etc. 

I took a couple of trips with them because the family friend cannot drive (but lives with her parents who do drive and she has a guy friend who drives her places a lot too..) and I realized she is really high strung for sure.. she got mad at my niece for bringing sand in the condo rental in her bathing suit and then just letting it out on the floor or something. Then she got worked up in New Orleans about her eating out of her friends' bowl after she had asked her to get another bowl. Just mad that she didn't listen and said she chooses not to listen to her a lot. 

So my niece texted me one day and said she wanted to live with me and had been thinking about it a lot. She had actually packed her bags and was ready for me to pick her up that day. I had also been taken in by a family member as a kid- my grandma took me in after my mom died when I was 9 & I'm forever grateful- so I kind of jumped on it and thought maybe this lady really is too much of a spazz and my niece is experiencing emotional trauma and I need to save her from it all. My husband wanted to put brakes on it and I was so insistent about it. I told them we could just let her take a break at my house for 2 weeks though and see what happens- however, her caretaker was freaking out about being ""legally responsible"" for her but her being at my house and was demanding either we get power of attorney or she was taking her back immediately (with police involved if needed). I think she was freaking out about possibly losing her, but it solidified my thoughts that we needed to keep her because this lady goes off the handle with anxiety it seemed. 

When my niece came to my house, she was on her phone 24/7. In her room and on the phone. I put limits on it, tried to limit it during school hours and turn it off for 9 hours at night, told her she had to make decent grades or I'd ground her from it. She made A's and B's. I did let her spend the night with some of her friends who her ""nana"" probably wouldnt have let her spend the night with. I told her if she ever planned to be sexually active I needed to know about it even though I did think she was too young for it, I'd get her birth control if she needed it. I asked her occasionally about sex and she said ""no, I'm definitely not ready for that"". Fast forward 7 months of her being at my house- we've had cops involved two times due to her friend choices & her actions- first time was because 2 of her friends jumped a girl in our apartment complex and she never told me about it but the girl ended up pressing charges and my niece was required to go in for questioning, the second time was because one of her friends drank a whole glass of vodka and left my apartment.. I came out to check on them and she wasn't here so had to call the police to help locate her & her dad took her home... but the whole time my niece was hiding the fact that the girl drank a whole glass of vodka and had thrown up before she left. 

We decided to take away social media completely after I checked her phone after that incident. She was being super sexual with her boyfriend and suggesting sex a whole lot (even though she lied and told me she had no desire), all the Tik Toks she was saving were sexual and inappropriate for her age, basically her new friend group she had was from social media.. I don't want her having access to SnapChat where we can't monitor anything that's going on.. so yeah, social media is banned and we told her. 

The kicker is-- all her texts to her boyfriend basically said she hates living here and wants to go back to her nana. This was on more than one day, more than one occasion, and not just when she was mad at me for whatever. She also told him she was only here for social media. 

Her nana is still 100% devoted to her and would take her back in a heartbeat. 

Do we send her back? I've questioned her about that and asked if she wants to go back and she basically says she doesn't know. She's scared about the pressure with grades but she isn't saying she wants to stay here now that social media and friend access has been taken away. (I told her she is no longer allowed to spend the night with sketch friends and I will fully vet anyone she spends the night with) I tell her she is definitely welcome to be with me but obviously if she's here there are now the same limits as nana's house and we can't take her places nonstop every weekend like nana did-- we have a toddler and less money (paying off debt right now.) 

She is about to spend a week with her nana next week.... she still hasn't said she wants to move back in with her though. 

If she was only here for social media and friends (my sad realization at this point.. really bothering me because it has affected my marriage so much!!! and taken away from my time with my toddler and stressed me out so it's hurting our little family.. all because of social media and stupid friends apparently..) then I need her to go back and live with her nana. 

What do I do? 

TL;DR- I let my 13 year old niece move in with me because I thought she was in a semi-emotionally abusive household with her ""nana"", teenage things like drinking and bad friends and lying started happening, then I found texts that she was only here for social media and access to her bad friend group. Can I send her back? What do I do? Her nana wants her and is willing to have her move back in but I still have my doubts about how good it is for her there.",2020.0,6.0,3.0,02:10:00,victim,13

Backstory- Me and my husband have been staying with my mom and brother during this time because she isn’t well and my brother isn’t able to handle it by himself. My mom hasn’t wanted to see her family they have a lot of drama. 

My mother(40) has been having very strange episodes where she believes me and he old co worker(worked with for one week who she thinks is stalking her) and apartment manager are working too together to take pictures of her while she is sleep, stalking/allowing stalkers into her home, threatening to harm her and our family or me helping them to threaten them, and much more crazy stuff. She’s even called the cops thinking her old co worker had me doing sex trafficking. So her mother and family knows what’s going on and they are enabling her. My husband and brother know for a fact nothing she is saying is true and so does her mother. This is where things get weird. She told my husband whose innocent btw that she believed some people came to beat me up and he stood there and was being weak. She told him to get out and threatened to end his life and called him the b word.. We called my grandma and she helped us with what to do. So she calls her sisters saying all this crazy stuff and they actually believed I was working against my mom which angered me because none of them are here helping at all so they don’t know all the sleepless nights I’ve had not the other members in the home with us. They would also rather focus on the fact of me getting married young and my husband which I think is about his race(white/Armenian and I’m black first man I’ve dated interracially) (he’s an amazing guy btw )and there jealousy because they all haven’t had successful relationships and have lots of kids(no judgement to anyone with children who isn’t married). They even judged me harshly. My grandmother didn’t even tell them she knew everything my mom said was wrong she just agreed with them and suggested we get out and go back to our own place (we are suppose to be moving June 12 btw). Her doctor knows what’s going on and she hasn’t even been taking her meds. So she actually put her hands on me because I grabbed the phone to try to explain to them what was happening. They wanted to come to where we are but we had a flight for her to see all of them rather than one or two family members coming here. Because of that she ended up actually biting me and putting her hands on me btw she has abused me as a child emotionally mentally and physically. She also shows favoritism to my brother. It seemed like no one was hearing me when I explained how hard it is to suppress my emotions from trauma because of abuse because I love her so much and want her to get the help she needs. I honestly feel like I have 0 family but my husband and my brother. I just don’t even want to breath. I need advice.

I was severely depressed and I ended up turning to drugs and self harm (cutting) for a couple of years. I believe the drug aspect was appropriated by my father who, growing up, would tell people about his drug escapades and made it all sound like it was fun and something your supposed to try. My parents would also get drunk every Friday night and they always seemed like they were having fun. 

My parents were very loving and always told us to put family first. She is my only sibling and we fought a lot growing up. I believe it was because of our age difference, the fact that I was hyper, and because she had an anger problem. I would constantly harass her to let me hang out in her room or let me play with her N64 but she didn't want me around, understandably. Her anger is pretty prominent in some memories. She used to scream, not yell, at one of her boyfriends back then for hours on end. I also remember one day,  I came home from school to my room being trashed because I locked up my hair straightener because she kept taking it out of my room and not putting it back. That day my dad met me at the door and calmly told me to go straight to my room, get the straightener, and give it to him  and then stay in my room for awhile. He wasn't mad at me, I just think he didn't know what the hell to do about her emotional outburst (although he had some temper issues too, albeit not that bad, just yelling). 

When I was a teenager I dated a really shitty guy because I was lonely and I knew he had access to drugs. It started with pot, alcohol, and cigarettes. That is mostly what it stayed at however we would also do anything that came around town from prescriptions to mushrooms. The worst of it involved smoking H for a couple of months. Overall, I do not remember much from those years. I was too depressed and messed up for much of it to stick. I know that the guy was extremely emotionally abusive based on some memories I've had or that have come back to me through dreams. I moved 400 miles away from home with him when I was 18 and my family was terrified when I left. My mom (63F) has told me repeatedly that she thought I was going to die. 

I ended up straightening my shit out over the next couple of years. I got back into college, completed a 2 year degree and am now closing in on finishing my Bachelor's. It has been a very bumpy ride coming back from all of that, but I have finally made it to a place where I am proud of myself. I am proud of everything I have overcome and accomplished and I am very happy with the person that I am and continue to strive to be. Along the way I have made amends with my family. I have apologized for everything I put them through and my parents and I have a healthy relationship. 

However, it seems like my sister is still hanging on to all the baggage. She never brought it up before all of these fights happened so we weren't able to talk about it previously. However a few months ago she called me and ranted to me for hours about everything that was hurting her from back then, about her position on the politics, all that stuff. We cried together and I apologized and I felt that our relationship was going to get better. But it hasn't. Her temper has not improved in the slightest and she has been using facebook posts to continue to attack my character. She regularly takes personal jabs based on the fact that she clearly thinks I haven't developed at all as a person. She isn't taking in anything that I have said and sees me as some manipulative, know-it-all that doesn't appreciate anything that anyone else has done for me. I just don't get it. Whenever I have responded to her, it's been with regulated emotions and as logical and rational as I can be. But it doesn't matter. My parents have acknowledged that she has emotional issues, but it doesn't matter what they say either and honestly, they won't got too far for fear of igniting her anger. I understand this as they are in their 60's and shouldn't have to deal with stuff like this anymore.

I am now wondering if I should cut her out because last night, yet again on facebook, multiple people were having a discussion on her post because I posted a fact check link on it. She immediately turned things personal on me, but then progressed to the point that she put my personal past of drug use on a facebook comment for everyone to see. I was appalled. I immediately deleted my initial comment, deleting most of the conversation on that post. It wasn't just that she put my personal business out there, it was also because I am unsure if it would impede me from getting into my career later as I will likely have to go to court periodically throughout the career regarding drug testing.

I messaged her and said that if she expected to have a relationship with me that she has to apologize. She responded stating that she wasn't proud of what she said (no apology) and that she deleted the entire post, apparently not realizing that I had already deleted that portion. But in my eyes she did something that you should never do, regardless of how upset you are. She let her emotions control her to the point of throwing my trust out the window. I have been through so much emotional abuse in the past and I am not interested in having people like this in my life anymore.

However, my family has basically begged us not to fight. My dad (66M) has terrible health and if he gets corona-virus, I know he won't make it. He has emotional issues too and I think it is where some of my sister's stem from. We also get together every Christmas and it is really important to my parents so if we are all still around come that time this year, I don't know what the hell we would do if I have decided to not have a relationship with her. Plus I love my parents so much, they did their best and I truly do not want to put them through all of that. So help me out reddit? I realize she's not nearly as bad as many people on here, but I am truly hurt and I don't want to deal with this anymore. Am I overreacting?

TL;DR - My sisters temper led to her putting my personal history on facebook so now I feel like I can't trust her and I don't know if I want her in my life anymore.",2020.0,6.0,4.0,04:05:38,victim,18

I have been in a turbulent relationship with my partner (25F) for the past 3 years, during the relationship we have had some awful times, due to us both being childhood victims of abuse that we never really resolved internally until now (well, we are working through it with therapy individually). Despite the rocky and often unstable nature of our relationship, we are still extremely close and love each other despite this. 

I am a twin sister and my twin recently got married to her on again off again since high school partner. They have a beautiful 2 year old and are hoping to have another soon. I have seen their relationship flourish and it has made me aware that this is something I really want for myself. 

I brought the idea of a family up to my partner and she was adamant that this was not something she wants for herself at the moment, as she is still not mentally/financially ready. I know in my heart and mind that I am not ready right now because I'm also not financially or mentally ready.

After this, it has made me question our relationship and I ended up asking her for us to take a break/break up. I know that we probably arent great for each other, but the other part of me says that I am so damaged and will find it near impossible to find someone who accepts and loves me for who I am - especially enough to have kids with me.

I am not getting any younger and this anxiety has greatly impacted my life, to the point where I am going into a deep depression. I'm even thinking about dating really soon after the break from my partner because I'm scared that if I leave it too long I wont meet anyone, and if I do itll take so long for us to form the same love my partner and I had that I wont be able to have kids (due to the body clock issue).

I am bisexual by the way, mostly into women, but I am not interested in dating women after my partner because that's just not the way I see my future.

TL;DR I was in a longterm relationship that was intense, rocky, but we were extremely close. I want kids, she doesnt right now and I have decided to take a break to fix myself. I'm scared I'll never find someone who will love me the same as my ex, resulting in me never having a family etc.",2020.0,5.0,27.0,15:06:22,victim,26

I have an enormous amount of problems with the way I was raised, but I can’t deny that my parents wanted me to have a better life, and they worked hard to give it to me. They have helped me as much as they could financially in college, and they’ve mostly encouraged me and supported the choices I’ve made. We don’t choose who our parents are, but I think I could’ve had a worse roll of the dice.

However, the area where I grew up is a bit oppressive. The entire community revolves around the local church, which says some rather wild things that everyone accepts. I was raised to believe the world is 6000 years old, gays are a fundamental danger to society, and that God creates 99.999% of people with the intention of sending them to an eternal hell of conscious torment, and we should have no problem with that. There is little room for dissent, and my disagreements have turned me into a personal conversion project for everyone who never left home whenever I return.

My mother was raised in abject poverty, and my father was abused a bit. I was abused a bit too, to be honest. Being the only son in a family of 8, I was given different expectations, and treated a bit rougher. I got hit a good many times. Looking back, I realize this was wrong, but it’s a can of worms I don’t want to open. They were wrong, but they want my life to be better than theirs.

However, I can’t really bring myself to love them anymore. The awful beliefs, the bad memories, the brainwashing, it makes me lose too much respect. Every time I visit, I feel like I’m being transported back 15 years to a worse time in an authoritarian and very noisy home. They still hold these beliefs, and I increasingly feel we have nothing in common anymore. I feel like nothing good comes from visiting home.

I’m considering leaving the state probably forever, and it’s likely I will cut relations a lot. I feel a bit cruel for doing this, but memories of home mostly are negative for me, even as my parents try to be supportive nowadays. 

I feel a sadness there. My older sisters married at 19, and never really were given a chance to build a life for themselves. Now, one is on the edge of divorce, and I can feel the despair. I feel like I escaped, but no one else did. I don’t know what I did to deserve it. I feel like the best thing I can do is be grateful for my life, and get far away from here. 

Thank you so much for reading all of this. 

TL;DR: I was raised in a hyper-religious, hyper-conservative, hyper-rural household. I don’t share those beliefs anymore, and I feel that that and some memories of abuse have damaged my relationship with my family enough that I don’t want to talk to them anymore, but I feel cruel.",2020.0,5.0,13.0,21:07:24,victim,99

We live together but I've often left to stay with an elderly aunt. The company I worked for went under 2 years ago and despite trying I still was never able to get another job (I was an administrative assistant). Each month I get more discouraged. I've been on some interviews but they never go anywhere. He always reminds me that I cannot make it on my own (he's not wrong obviously) and need him. He does have much more earning power than me but he's also in a bad position financially (rents, lots of debt, pays child support for his daughter already). In other words, it's not like we are married and there was anything to split.

&#x200B;

What I can't wrap my head around is the feelings I have for him. I *feel* like I love him very much, but I know this cannot be true. He's hurt me so much in so many ways. But the intensity of my feelings for him are more than anything I've felt before. I keep trying to leave, and I keep going back to him.

&#x200B;

He's cheated on me, he's repeatedly lied to me, he verbally abuses me and on occasion he's physically hurt me. Everything that goes wrong in his life (that is his responsibility) he either blames on me, or says ""we"" screwed it up. ""We"" are incompetent. We *did* have the promise of a good life together at one point in time, but it quickly went downhill with his lying and cheating and physical abuse. And instead of leaving, I stayed.

I tried to leave again. And once again I was waking up all alone in a basement room in my aunt's house. Facing my empty life. No job. No family other than my elderly, ill father (who I try to look after as best I can, but it rips my heart out because my strong competent dad has become a frail, elderly man with Alzheimer's). I have no one to comfort me and I'm lonely and I end up going back to him because it's familiar.

So, this guy, we will call him Sam, and I used to date three years ago. It was a short term relationship, and it was my first everything. However he was super pressuring on me, and wasn't always the nicest, he wasn't a bad person, but we inevitably split. I hated him for the longest time since he had offended me, and pressured me into doing things, when I didn't know, however at this moment in time I don't regret anything. 

Well a few months out of that relationship I met, my now ex, we will call him Ben. Ben and I met in HS, and he was a year older. We went out for two years, and the first year and a half were complete bliss. However, he became extremely jealous, and him and his father would consistently talk down on me, and have fits of anger/arguments that led to hold statements being said such as "" you never make me happy, I don't love you anymore, you don't care about my son, you are judgemental and my son could get 100 hotter girls then you"" etc etc. 

Well, Ben and I broke up a few times, and the first time, I just wanted to ensure he would never do it again. He was pretty well off, I wasn't, and his bday was coming up, and I wanted to get him something nice but my parents hated him, and didn't want to help with money, I had none since they wouldn't let me work, and any money I did make my family took away  as "" I didn't need the money"". So I went on Kik, and sold feet pictures. Not mine, just some off of Instagram, and I did that for a bit, yielding positive results, when I got approached and offered some money to flash someone. I didn't think anything of it at the time, and I did it, but right afterwards I realized what I did and I blocked the person, didn't accept any money. I kept it to myself for a few months. Well, Ben and I continued to have problems, just him not controlling his stress well, and after time the guilt got to me, and I told him what I did, but not the reason. He broke, completely, and although he had hurt me a few times before I couldn't handle doing that to someone. I didn't tell him the reason cause I didn't want him to look at me as a prostitute, because he could never relate, growing up with a functional family with money, whereas I grew up in an abusive household and had to fend for myself. Well, I eventually made up a lie if a reason, and it includes Sam. 

Since Sam and I ended on bad terms, I never imagined speaking to him again, and Sam and Ben would never interact with one another, so I thought no harm done, and I could protect Ben's feelings. Well, I told Ben, that Sam had made me do it, and that if I didn't he would leak my nudes. Far fetched lie, I know, but it served it's purpose, and Ben and I dated for a few months more, however the problems between us, with him handling stress bad and the comments from his family never stopped so I broke things off. Well, Sam has texted me, and I was reluctant at first. He has completely changed as a person, new job, graduated, doing well, and a lot more humbled then the pressuring egotistical guy I dated three years back, and I'm very happy for him. He wants to meet up, and I'm open to being friends, however he asked if I would ever be open to giving it a try again. I said I was unsure because I have some of my own problems, but I'm happy he reached out, and want him as a friend in my life. Now, the thing is, I'm worried maybe I would want to give it another try but, I told that massive lie about Sam, to Ben, because I never imagined seeing any of them again. I've felt massive guilt for months about the lie, even prior to Sam reaching out to me, and it's just very difficult ATM in what I should do. 

A part of me, wants to maybe give Sam another try, if I felt something, but another part of me thinks, even tho I've changed as a person, that massive lie is something I could never tell him, and that I should just stay out of his life, let him dodge the bullet I am, and watch him be happy from the sidelines. I can't hurt another person, and although Sam may never find out, I feel guilty and who knows, maybe Ben might reach out and accuse him of something, and it would be a huge mess if a situation.

I know they wouldn't tattle on me, but knowing that they saw my post would make me really embarrassed. Just a heads up: there are no ""bad guys"" in this situation. I'm just worried about how to approach a conversation with my parents. 

Before we talk about me, here's some background on my family, particularly my dad. My father is a rally good guy. I know a lot of people think their dad is the best guy ever, but I genuinely think that. 

He dropped out of law school to travel (and get tattoos, lol) after my (abusive) grandfather died, and decided to settle down and become a history teacher because he liked learning/teaching so much. He had a pretty hefty inheritance, but he used it for travel/to set up his life and put a fair share of it away for the future. He also donated portions as well. 

He ended up marrying his best friend from highschool (my mom) and they're still like... painfully in love. My mom grew up pretty poor, but she put herself through school to become a kindergarten teacher. She's a very kindhearted person, and I'm pretty sure she's the reason why my dad picked up teaching too. They both love each other a lot, and obviously think highly of each other. 

They're great parents -- I can't recall a single moment in my childhood where I felt unloved or neglected. Neither of my parents had mothers, so my mom tries really hard to be a good mom, and my dad was raised mainly by his older sister, so he tries really hard to be a good dad (since his wasn't). 

There's no huge conflict here. I just don't know what to do with my life, and I'm terrified of disappointing them. I'm the eldest child and their only son, and I want to make them proud. I'm terrible at sports, my grades are As-Bs, and I lack any kind of direction in my life. I don't feel particularly passionate about anything. I'm also gay, and I haven't told them yet. 

How do I approach a conversation with them? I know they'll be loving and understanding, and I'm not worried about them being mad at me. I just want to know how I can present these issues (feeling lost about my life & coming out) without coming off like an idiot.

First time poster. I'm just wanting to know if any of you would class this as an abusive relationship.

So to start off with I'm a 30yo Male, and now ex is a 27yo female.

We have known each other for 17 years and have also been in a off again on again relationship for those 17 years.
Whilst we have been going out she has always forced me to lose contact with my friends, forced me to not talk to other females (perfectly fine for her to talk to other males), tells me what to do as if I am her child.

She wouldn't let me go out without her knowing where I was going, who I was with, and if I took longer than what I said I would be she would ring my phone non-stop.
Now with saying that, most of the time when I was going to go out she HAD to come with me.

We tried relationship counseling but that always ended the same way, she had her say, I had my say everything would be fine whilst around the counselor but as soon as we left she would have a go at me about what I had said.

She has just walked out on me again for another guy that she has gotten infatuated with due to him been able to spend his whole day giving her the attention she believes she deserves. I work 2 jobs doing 48 hours per week over 6 days. So I don't have the time to spend my whole day with her.

We have had a child together and when she walked out on me she took my daughter with her and is trying to say that I am a danger to my child when I'm angry, (side  note; I have NEVER taken my anger out on my child, she has only ever received a smack on the hand for reaching for a hot stove (legally aloud to do that in my country)), she has already ruined the bond between my daughter and I and is now trying to ruin it even more so by her walking out and not letting me see my daughter.

I know that this tactic of hers is using my daughter as a pawn in her games.

Another thing on the anger thing, I have only ever hit my now ex once. After she had hit me in the family jewels 8 times, she rang the police when I hit her, thebpolice arrived and the responding officer said that it was fair enough and that he wouldn't of waited for 8 hits to defend himself.

So as I asked at the start of this, would you guys call this an abusive relationship?

TL:DR - I believe my now expired relationship was abuse but needing others input.

We're pretty crazy for each other and have never insulted or yelled at one another. She's talked about getting married for a while, and I'm thinking about it more lately. She was initially down to just elope, but changed her mind.

The issue for me is wedding invites. This is so severe to me, I don't want a wedding at all, but Cary really wants one, and her parents also do. She has lots of extended family in the immediate and a handful of friends, giving her plenty of people to come to it. I... Well, I've never really known any of my extended family since I've never lived near any of them, and from what I've heard, they're pretty much all awful people I wouldn't want to invite.

For family, that leaves on one half my mom and sister, and the other, my dad, stepmother, stepbrother, and stepsister. My mom and dad had an extremely contentious divorce and my sister went no contact with our dad ten years ago. My dad is emotionally abusive and lately I'm trying to keep my relationship with him to a minimum without cutting him out entirely. If anything, my relationship with my stepfamily is worse. I would prefer not to have any of my dad's side at the wedding if possible. Only my mom and sister are nice people I'm close to.

That would leave room for friends, right? Well... I don't have any I'm close enough to justify inviting them, IMO. For starters, two people I consider(ed) among my closest friends didn't invite me to their wedding. I don't have a best friend, or really any friend who doesn't require me to contact them first 90-100% of the time, and haven't since I was 11. The people from that time are >2,000 miles away and completely out of the picture. To invite any friend feels like a waste of money and an embarrassment.

Full disclosure: I have incredible emotional and mental health problems despite having been in therapy for nearly 18 years now. I don't want a wedding because of this huge imbalance. Maybe that's something I shouldn't worry about, but I am. What should be done about this? Should I suck it up? Or try to talk it out to find an alternative?

Instead, my brother's partner has been sharing updates and photos via texts, facetime, and social media. My sister posted a video of her child the other day and on the same day, my brother's partner shared some photos of their baby. My sister was so upset by this that she had her husband call my brother out in our family group text about how it's disgusting to not comment on her video and only to post photos to ""one-up"" her child.

For context, my brother and his partner live with his partner's family. A few days before the baby was born, someone in the house tested positive for Covid-19. My sister offered up a room in her house to my brother and his partner, to which they declined as they didn't want to expose my sister and family. My sister has visibly grown more upset by the day every time my brother's partner posts on social media and any time she sees my brother's partner's family holding the baby (at this point, everyone in the house has the covid antibodies but is no longer actively carrying the virus - want to give the whole truth here). 

It came to a head today when my dad reached out to my sister privately to tell her he was concerned about her anger and that my brother and his partner were just trying to share happy moments with people they care about since they can't do it in person and that she should be trying to support her little brother in a very stressful time.

This was over text, so my sister starting replying angrily but then her husband took her phone (or she gave it to him) and started calling my dad a bunch of inexcusable names, accusing him of turning the family against my sister, and then said he's ""cut-off"" and my dad is no longer allowed to be in contact with my sister and nephew. Because of the continual bombardments via text, my brother and dad have both blocked my sister and her husband now. 

My sister has acted this way in this past, but never to this extreme. Her husband is a drinker, and I'm concerned that since he has been working from home the last two months that he may have grown abusive. To me, it looks like he's trying to alienate her from her family, but I also know that I am deeply entrenched in this situation and I'm looking for an outsider's perspective.

I feel like I need to reach out to my sister at this point and try to de-escalate the situation but I don't want to say something that might alienate her even more.

But as the nine months progressed, I saw more and more mood swings and EXTREME and strange reactions to things that are minimal (see original post for examples.) At times he would say things that are so cruel, it must be to intentionally hurt me. I wasn't sure, but think it may have been emotional abuse. I think he may have slight borderline personality disorder, also he is in AA.

Some examples to prove his reactions are not ""normal"":

\-One time he told me he didn't like my personality because I ""bothered"" him by pointing out a long line at a deli.

\-He was rude/left the restaurant the first time meeting my best friend (this was only 2 months in!) because her BF didn't come with us to dinner (he never was supposed to come, my BF just got mad for some reason 5 mins into dinner and left.)

\-Once I told him that I heard on the news it would snow later that day so he left work. It didn't snow. He got FURIOUS with me because I ""caused"" him to leave work and told me he could never trust me again.

\-He was wearing the same hat as a woman. I pointed out they had the same hat and he BLEW UP raging mad for 6 hours because I ""called him feminine.""

\-He shaved his head during quarantine and I jokingly said ""WOW! You're a different person."" I said it two separate times on facetime because he did look totally different! He thought I was insulting his appearance and didn't understand how I don't realize this is insulting. Fuming mad about this.

\-We were going to visit my sister in another city. I was really excited and he knew all the plans. One involved dinner with her friends. The night before we went he asked me ""Do you really think I want to hang out with your sister and all her little friends?""

\-He was in a horrible mood. We had gotten a gift card for a certain restaurant and went that night. The music was loud and it felt ""going-out ish."" He got in an even worse mood and wouldn't talk to me at all. I said I know this isn't your first choice place, but you're a grown up and this is date night, can't we just make the best of it? All he said was ""let's just get this over with, I hope the food comes fast"". We sat in uncomfortable silence the whole meal.

\-He asked me to leave his apt at 2:30 am because he couldn't sleep. Apparently he was annoyed that my dog was sleeping in bed and that I left her water bowl in the middle of the apartment without asking him first. I was sound asleep and had to walk home through the streets of NYC at 2:30 am with my dog.

\-His brother works at a restaurant and his hours are being cut. My uncle owns a company in the same town. I asked my uncle if his company was hiring (I did not give his brother's name or anything), and if my uncle said yes, my plan was to pass the info on to my BF and then he and his brother could make a decision about whether to apply. He got FURIOUS that I asked. ""How dare I get involved with his brother or his family."" I literally was only trying to help. He could have said that was nice but no thanks. Instead he told me he's not sure he loves me anymore and doesn't know if he wants me to meet his family (we were leaving for me to meet his family for the first time the following week.) He also came into my apartment without telling me first to search for and take his keys back as a result of this.

In the original post, about 150 people answered and the VAST majority was to RUN.

So where I am now.

I broke up with him the end of January right after I posted that original post. He reached out a month later and we have been ""trying"" again the last two months. We are not officially together but trying. My issue is that things have been so perfect the last two months and now I don't know what to do (also someone smartly pointed out that in quarantine he has many fewer stresses in terms of commuting and work that would often cause the mood swings.) I think I love him, but I don't love those parts of him. And I am TERRIFIED it will go back to how it was (if it does, I'm gone.) But I also haven't seen those parts of him in two months, so maybe it's better? Or maybe he's just on his best behavior. He has been in therapy now for five months, but can therapy really change his personality? I know that we will argue, that's a given, but it can't get to the point that it was. It was horrific towards the end and I was basically always on eggshells waiting for the next explosion.

Basically, what do I do??? Please help. Most people in my life hate him for how he treated me in the past and can't get past that if I were to give him a second chance. I don't even honestly know if I want to give him a second chance, because can people really change? Also, yesterday was my birthday and I am now 32 and TERRIFIED to not be able to have a family based on my age. I almost feel like he is my last chance and the last thing I want to do is date again. I have a really hard time meeting people I click with.

PLEASE, PLEASE HELP. I cannot stop crying and I just don't know how to make the decision of whether to stop wasting time and just end it, or keep going to see if he really has changed.

Thank you SO much!!

709,100,221,How do I [21F] convince my mom [58F] to stop commenting on my dad’s weight [60M] ?,16.0,gnu1v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gnu1v8/how_do_i_21f_convince_my_mom_58f_to_stop/,7.0,1590084074.0,"So, my dad hasn’t always been overweight or obese. Until I was about 6, he was an average weight and exercised, but stopped and began eating very badly and secretly to avoid having to admit how much junk food he was having. 

This led to him having a heart attack last year. This was very stressful for everybody involved. Clearly for my dad, since he was hooked up the machines in Intensive Care and told he now had a heart condition that required a rainbow of daily medications. Stressful for my mom because she didn’t know whether he husband was going to die - and she had to take unscheduled time off work. Stressful for me because I didn’t know if my dad was going to die - and it was in the middle of my university exams, so I had to balance the stress of worrying for my dad with the stress of trying to study in a hospital setting. 

Anyway, it was all very surreal and awful. He’d been in hospital about 4 times in the past 2 years but never for something as serious as a heart attack. 

When he was let out, he was made exercise and monitor his weight/health by being told to visit classes with fellow heart attack victims. 

However, in the year after until now, he’s begun eating badly again, getting defensive and not exercising. My mom and I tried to drag him out on hour-long walks but he either refuses to go, or comes but makes sure we know he’s miserable. Walking is probably the least strenuous exercise he could do though. (Swimming would be good too but he’s a very poor swimmer.)

My mom tries to help him, but I don’t think her method is right. She asks him what he eats that’s different from the rest of the family, and asked him to weigh himself because we never do (I don’t even know what weight I am). I think she thinks that he doesn’t actually notice himself getting unhealthier but I’m sure he does - he can barely walk 10 minutes without becoming breathless and red. 

He gets incredibly defensive, claiming that my mom only does these things because it makes her feel good about herself and she’s being sadistic. This obviously really hurts my mother’s feelings because, she just wants her husband to be happier and live longer. He was happier in himself before he became obese, and you can tell he’s unhappier now. She said it’s part of her job as his wife. 

His contempt for us encouraging him to exercise is hard enough every day. But, I have to try very hard to not say mean things to him because, he’s actually really mean about obese people - especially women, for some reason. When he sees a bigger woman, he can’t help but point her out (not to her face obviously) and often calls big women ‘big fat, jiggly women’. The hypocrisy and just nastiness makes me really want to say mean things to him but, I’ve gotten better at holding my tongue or just telling him off for being judgemental. I think he’s insecure about his own weight and then comments mean things about other overweight people as a result. It really pisses me off. Even if he wasn’t also obese, he’s just being horrible about strangers. 

I mean, why is it cruel for his wife to say ‘You should stop snacking so often’, but it’s not cruel for him to say about a stranger ‘oh my God look at the thighs on her. How does somebody that size wipe their ass?’ (Unfortunately a quote from last week, to which I awkwardly replied ‘The same way everyone else does ..?’) 

So, clearly what my mom is doing isn’t working, and is actually making everyone unhappier and unhealthier. The weighing and asking about food, it was brought to my attention, could actually be abusive and a form of shaming - which I know my mom doesn’t mean it as. 

She asks about food specifically because we eat healthily as a family. We home cook all our meals, eat vegan 3-4 days a week and tend to only eat sweets on Fridays and Saturdays. Thus, his eating that’s leading to his ill health must be in secret and so it’s hard to know just how much junk he’s actually consuming. 

She just sees it as love in action. I have very problematic feet for example, and hate them being touched, so she had to lowkey bully me into going to a chiropodist because I was being childish about it. But she did it out of love and now, I can walk without pain! 

How do I approach this with my mom? We adore my dad, as judgemental and grumpy as he can be, and want him to be more confident and agile like he used to be - but he lacks the confidence to do it. My mom badgering him and treating him like a kid is coming from a place of love, but he may think he’s being abused. But equally, I know that doing and saying nothing would lead to him becoming even worse. His approach to his health and weight after his heart attack is like a kid who hasn’t studied for an exam - avoid avoid avoid to try and forget that you’ve fucked up, until it’s too late. 

Any advice is welcome. My dad is not a confident man and both my mom and I genuinely believe, from how he was before versus now, that he would feel happier, as well as live longer, if he confronted his issue. However, I really fear that my mom is accidentally abusing him without knowing what she’s doing, and I don’t know what the balance is. 


Tl;dr - my mom is trying to help my dad from having another heart attack, but her methods aren’t working. How do I convince her that she needs to stop?",2020.0,5.0,21.0,23:46:14,victim,10
710,101,222,Am I being emotionally ABUSED or am I worthless and his behaviour is justified? Honest answers please...,1.0,frexqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/frexqg/am_i_being_emotionally_abused_or_am_i_worthless/,12.0,1585550506.0,"TL;DR I have been with my partner for a little more than 8 years and there have been many periods of turbulence. He tells me that I contribute nothing to our family and that I am worthless because I am not working full time. I am the primary caretaker for our Children, I clean the house, do the laundry and do EVERYTHING WITH AND FOR MY CHILDREN. When I am in school or working any source of income I do get I always send it to him as he handles our finances. When I am working or in school I am just as active and engaged as a mother but he says that because the Job was contractual (I was going to be back in school in the fall) it doesn’t really matter that I was picking them up right after leaving work and going to the park or swimming etc. Is it right/fair for him to be an absentee Father, not ever Clean up after himself or the Kids, never do our sins laundry or take initiative to bring them anywhere, not take responsibility for his conditions and seek treatment outside of Weed, simply because he works full time and makes more money than me? 



We have two Children (I have one from my First relationship) and he and I have a son together but he is not a hands on father and doesn’t participate as a parent or partner. Our son has become more aware of his Absence when we go out to the park, skating, anywhere really and I can see if affecting him. He will verbally tel me he wishes Dad was with us or that he wished Dad would do more with us and I’m getting tired of having too see and hear his pain. It’s to the point that whenever we go out (which is almost everyday as I am an active person and love to bring my Children to new, fun, active and productive activities) when he see other children with their Fathers he becomes very clingy to the other a Fathers/Men around us. I know this is because there is a void and it is truly affecting him. 

My partner was diagnosed with ADHD, Anxiety and depression when he was 16 and has not sought out treatment even now as a 30 yo Man. He has smoked weed chronically since he was 12 and that has negatively impacted him and his underlying conditions and now it is affecting me and our Family. 

I have worked full time (contractual) but I am a full time University student. I am however taking time off as there have been issues in my life that I have had to address and with no help or support from my Family (I am alone) or him and had a breakdown. 

I have spent so many years focusing on him and our relationship, trying to change any and everything about me to accommodate him so that he will commit and step up as a Partner and Father and it isn’t working... never has. 

I come from a long line of abandonment and abuse and this in addition to my own neurological impairments (that I sought treatment for as soon as I got my official diagnosis 2 years ago)  have made my self esteem and self worth non existent... I allow him to treat me like I am worthless because I am afraid of being abandoned and I think he knows that and takes advantage to hurt me when we are fighting. 

I tell him that I have come a long way, that I am a good Mother and I am trying to give them the best quality of life; the life I never had. His response is that I don’t really do anything, that I don’t know how to be an adult because I’m not working, that I don’t do enough around the house and that I’m not contributing to this Family in a meaningful way...

Is this normal or am I worthless ? 

I am in the process of getting healthy, mentally and physically and that is making me feel confident... it makes me feel amazing really ! 

My identity has been conflated or wrapped up in either my relationship with him or my Motherhood so when he tells me I’m not good enough as a Mom or that I don’t do enough... as someone that has faced adversity many would only have nightmares about... I know I’ve come far and I know I’m a good Mother.

We would text every single day and talk for hours, and throughout the time we did date for a while, but became friends and things were still normal. She would always tell me how I’m her best friend and that she would never want to lose me as a friend ever.

The other day we were just talking casually, and I told her I have to go do some studying. After a few hours or so later I texted hey what’s up. The answers with “I can’t talk to you” and proceeds to block me on WhatsApp and on Instagram which are the only 2 apps we communicate on. She then proceeds to tell me later that night an another Instagram that she’s now dating this guy and he knows I dated her and she asked for space. I said fine have your space. She unblocked me the next morning telling me that if I receive any message from somebody, don’t reply to it and I should delete all my chats with her and block her, and that she will explain later. I did so. An hour later she texts me on a newly created Instagram account saying hey, I’m so sorry about this, this is my new account and that I shouldn’t text her because her “new boyfriend” is spying on her phone. I still did not answer her since she said don’t text me at all. Then she proceeds to make a 3rd account (which I’m skeptical about) saying “Don’t ever text me again in your life, don’t ever try to say hi or check up on me ever again.” I was wondering if this was the message she warned me about or not so I proceeded to text her on her new account asking if this was her or not. She never bothered to reply.

Now all I want to do is send her a big somewhat nasty message expressing how I feel about all this but not sure if I should. Any advice or analysis would be greatly appreciated.

712,103,224,"6 y relationship ended yesterday out of lying, cheating and behaviour issues",2.0,gr1tq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gr1tq6/6_y_relationship_ended_yesterday_out_of_lying/,12.0,1590544102.0,"I (26 M) ended my relationship with my ex (24 F) yesterday after reuniting with her again for a year. We first ended back in December 2017 after 4.5y together because we both had behavioural issues. I was verbally abusive, aggressive, and wanted things my way. She had strong lack of attention, laziness, immaturity and deep communication problems. We stayed apart for 2 years before reuniting again in April 2019.

In this period we stayed apart we both were extremely hurt and realised there was no way we could continue together because we both had to deal with our own problems, and mature to become better individually better. I focused heavily into therapy for 1.5 years, older trusted and mature people advice, religion, solid friendships and a support group. She decided to go to a foreign country for a exchange trip and English training for 6 months and there she said she was changed for good, but never committed herself with any therapy, or any behavioural or communication advice from anybody.

After she came back from the exchange program we still had the same friends group and eventually got closer. It was obvious to everybody we still loved each other and had strong feelings for one another. One day we had a one in a lifetime encounter, we had a sincere talk, cried, asked for forgiveness from our mistakes, expressed things we never shared, and it was a very sincere life changing event for our relationship. Since this date we got even closer and although we had some sparks here and there, we talked to our families and I asked her parents for forgiveness for my behaviour in the past, our friends continued to support us coming back together and that's what we did. In April 2019 we were back as a couple.

After we got back together I was slowly realising she didn't really changed. It was truly a mistake to get back together, she portrayed to be a completely different person coming back from her 6 months trip. She was visually changed and she could really convince that she had really changed while in her alone time immerse in a completely different culture, but she really wasn't. She just got back with the same behavioural issues, the same or even worse communication problems and she even got jealousy issues with a female friend who had and still has a boyfriend till this day.

As time went by our problems from the first time we were together started to face and new problems were put in the table. She decided to go to a voluntary trip to the amazon forest to help locals in need and there she met another volunteer guy, felt in love with him and even mentioned to her tutor that she wanted to stay and live with him and do volunteer work for life. While in the trip she constantly ignored my messages, saying it was lack of service in the woods, but she could post pictures no prob everyday. I just felt she was acting weird but we never had betrayal history or anything like that..

When she came back from her trip she felt guilty and told everything that happened to me. I instantly felt sick and cried and decided to go home. She was like another person to me. She was even still feeling ""jet lag"" but in a different way. She was still attached to the other guy and couldn't decide what she wanted. Me or her life in the woods with this guy she just met for a week. And then I went of to my car and there she entered my car as I was still in shock with everything that happened and couldn't start the engine. We stayed sit there just crying. And after several minutes I just hugged her and said I forgive her. And she promised she would work things out and completely forget about the guy.

After that moment trusting her was very hard. She still had him in her social network, he would still talk to her occasionally up until 3 weeks or something that she completely blocked him and she never mentioned him again. But trust was never the same. She still had strong lack of attention, lack of empathy, laziness, insecurity issues, jealousy when there was clearly nothing and general immaturity, not being able to sustain a grown up relationship.

She would still refuse to put herself into therapy or communication tutoring, she basically never did anything to improve her behaviour issues and become a better person. She would hide things from me saying she thought I would react in a specific way. She would constantly put herself into trouble at work because she couldn't communicate well and her clients would complain about her. She would only say she was sorry after every single fight we had and promise to change whenever she felt we were about to break up and put herself into her knees and beg for forgiveness but in real life after I had forgiven her each and every time selflessly she would do nothing to improve and act different.

It was up until this week that things really ended for us. I was in the hospital with my mom letting her into a room to be taken into ICU because she was not getting better from home treatment for covid 19 for the past 2 weeks. I asked if she could stay with me on the phone because it was going to be a very difficult situation to face alone. I asked if she could call me twice a day or just send me supportive messages, but she said that she wouldn't have any time available to help and be present for me because she had her post graduate orthodontics training to take that week and she was supposed to be busy from 7am till 5pm, but I left the hospital at 8pm and she didn't say a word about how we were doing and if my mom was really taken into ICU.

That only showed me how little she cared for me. But then when I thought things couldn't get worse I found out she lied to me saying she had to take this course, but instead she was selling a online English course all day and wanted to beat the company selling records as she was performing really good. The only way I found out about this is because her selling report was shared onine by somebody in her family to congratulate her on being the person that most sold English courses that day.

That was it for me. She left me alone taking my mom into ICU and couldn't even text me to give me courage and support while she was selling English courses online. She lied about not being available to be there for me and this was her last lie. We had a huge argument on how she never changed, on how us coming back together was the worst mistake I've ever done. On how she refused this whole 6 years together to search for professional help for her behaviour issues while I took no extra time to spend 1.5 years on therapy and get my shit together. She cheated on me less than 3 months we got back together, she would constantly lie about things, hide things from me, and act out of immaturity.

We broke up yesterday after several, infinite times I openly forgave her of her mistakes, after 6 years waiting for her to improve on herself and completely letting go the cheating, the trust issues I had after the lies, and just negotiating what was never to be negotiable in a adult relationship, just because I loved her to death. And I thought she would be my wife in the future and the mother of my child. I am here today, still deeply in love with her, still suffering like crazy, still having to face my mom being put into ICU and I don't know what to do.

TL;DR:
broke up 6y relationship yesterday because of cheating, lying, behavioural issues, immaturity, and communication problems but still deeply in love with her. I dealt with my behavioural issues for a 1.5 years in therapy and became a more mature man but she refuses to treat her problems after 6 years.

713,104,225,Is my (33F) husband (35M) abusive?,4.0,fdy6x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fdy6x1/is_my_33f_husband_35m_abusive/,15.0,1583456234.0," Husband and I married for just over 5 years, together for 10+. Lately I've been wondering if some of his behaviors are borderline abusive.

We have great communication when things are going well and a fairly equal division of labor around the house etc which isn't nothing with two kids. He generally is emotionally supportive of me day-to-day and typically encourages me to try new things, have friends etc. Things are great when they are great!

However, when we argue, it often leads to yelling from his side and me shutting down. There have been instances in the past where things have gotten almost physical - he's punched the wall, followed me to the bathroom (door locked) in a fight and broke down the door, recently in an argument blocked my way down the hall (but I did have a different route I could take by back-tracking through the kitchen).

When I've brought up these things and said they were concerning (red flags) and scare me he often responds by saying I'm making him out to be a terrible person, or an abuser. He has taken off his wedding ring as a result of these discussions as well. To be fair to him, he has been working on the yelling and agreed / apologized the door situation was very much not okay and would never be repeated.

He really minimizes my POV: example through saying - you had a different route, I wasn't blocking your way.

There have been instances where he has lied to me about things that clearly happened - the first time he took his ring off, we were driving out of town and to make sure I noticed he was stretching his hand on the steering wheel and glaring at me in the rear view mirror (I was in the back with the kids). When I noticed I was shocked - he denied having glared at me in the mirror, and denied that he saw I had noticed (so much so, I believe him that the moment hadn't happened and I had imagined it)... but a week afterwards he admitted this did in fact happen. He often accuses me of gaslighting him, which is confusing to me.

I understand that this post is one sided, and people are complicated but reading some literature on abuse it seems that the only option is to leave, we do have children and he is a great father so I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater...

Sorry for the long post! Also we are attending counseling, but have only been to two sessions so hopefully that will help as well.

Wanting advice:

1. Am I preemptive in assuming that this is in fact abusive behavior? Am I overreacting and projecting (my mother and father have a relatively dysfunctional relationship) or are there concerning things happening here?
2. In therapy I've side stepped these concerns a bit because I want him to keep going and I'm afraid if I bring them up head on he'll quit and no progress will be made - does this make me an asshole?

Sorry, this is a really long one, but I would really appreciate some help.

TLDR: My uncle verbally abused me and my family and has zero remorse, but I can't completely cut him off. What do I do?

In February 2020, we (me, my grandmother, father, stepmother, brother, uncle, and aunt) had a nice birthday dinner for all the recent birthdays. I (F21) am a dedicated cook, and made a semi-elaborate meal for everyone, taking all requests (charcuterie board, ratatouille, cauliflower gratin, homemade pie, hand whipped cream, and more), most of which came from my Uncle (M48). I was more than happy to accommodate! I made sure there were both vegan, keto, and pescatarian options. I love being able to provide food to my family as an expression of love. I made sure we had a big bouquet of flowers as a centerpiece, I really tried to do the damn thing, especially since my grandfather had passed in August and we all really were (and still are) missing him.

At the end of the dinner, my grandmother made an extremely innocent comment in passing. It was roughly ""Isn't it so sad about \[insert recently deceased celebrity's name here\]?"" and instead of being like, ""Yes, very sad"" my uncle challenged her in a really aggressive and domineering way. He went OFF about how celebrity culture is a cancer and how sycophantic 99% of people are because they all buy into this idea of ""celebrity."" He gets like this sometimes (more than one gathering has been ruined because he just won't. shut. up. One time he ranted about how 9/11 was an inside job for an HOUR AND A HALF at a family lunch), and I was so sick of it. No one ever challenges him, so I finally was like ""I disagree! I don't think there is anything wrong with people being sad about someone who impacted their life passing away. I just don't think I'm smarter/better than everyone who is saddened by this."" He pushed back and I said, ""I just don't feel I'm as superior to them as you feel you are.""

HE BLEW UP AT ME. Now while this is obviously an oversimplification of the conversation, I swear this is an honest representation of what we said, except he was swearing a lot (not something anyone else really does in front of my grandmother), so there was really no way of thinking it would escalate like this, other than knowing he can be a total jerk sometimes (yelling at his wife in front of family, hitting his dogs, etc-- a real winner). He went wild-- shouting at me, swearing at me, calling me names, challenging me (I remember he shouted ""JUST MAKE A FUCKING POINT"" repeatedly, then would cast off whatever point I made).

I hate this about myself, but men's raised voices tend to trigger something in me and make me cry (my alcoholic mother's alcoholic second husband is extremely abusive and yells a lot, as does she, and I've been around that since I was 6, so I'm sure that has something to do with it). So there I am, crying (trying not to, biting my cheeks so hard they bled *a lot*), shaking, and saying over and over ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you upset, I'm sorry, you were right, I was wrong"" just saying whatever I could to deescalate the situation and move on. Meanwhile, my grandmother is in hysterics, screaming and crying and yelling ""Make it stop, make it stop."" His wife has left the table, along with my stepmother, just to get away from the situation. My father (ultimate conflict avoider, but also frequent peace maker) had been silent. My baby brother was next to me, I couldn't tell what he was thinking (I knew he was upset, but I didn't know if it was at me or our uncle).

My uncle says something to me along the lines of ""You think you're so fucking smart, but you're not,"" which barely stung at all (I know how smart I am-- enough to know how much I don't know), which for some reason was the breaking point for the two men sitting near me. My father interjected (""Hey now, let's settle down--""), but didn't finish before my teenage baby brother came to my defense. He shouted ""DON'T YOU TALK TO MY SISTER LIKE THAT!"" and stood up in a rush. My uncle, a nearly 50 year old adult, stood up across the table and puffed up at the teenager confronting him. He made an allusion to the fact that the next time my brother ""did that again"" he (my uncle) would ""do a lot more than just yell,"" and continued to scream (now at me and my brother). My father was between them in a flash, hands on each chest, trying to calm everyone down. My brother was fairly calm, but my uncle had gone nuclear.

I left the table to hold my grandmother who, a few feet away, way clearly having a panic attack. I held her up as she almost fell to the ground, hyperventilating, sobbing, and clutching at me. After a long time of my dad speaking to his brother in a calm, reasonable manner, he gave up; he left with his wife my brother, I went downstairs (I wasn't going to leave my grandmother alone with him). He ranted and raved some more to no one in particular and left an hour or so later in a huff. I went upstairs and held my grandmother as we both cried.

I texted him and apologized, he was snarky in response, I left it alone.

It has been several months, he has not offered an apology to anyone and has zero remorse.

What do I do? I hate being around him, my already bad anxiety gets extremely elevated just thinking about having a conversation with him. I feel like anything I say, no matter how innocent, could get conflated into another giant argument (and what if it happens when my dad isn't around? Will he hurt me? I have a feeling it wouldn't be a huge leap for him). I **HATE** the idea that the lesson I'm supposed to take away from this is to be a good little woman and keep my trap shut while a man is talking, but I seriously don't know what else to do while being around someone so irrational (this is made more painful because of the environment my mother raised me in-- talk back, get hit).

Can anyone offer advice about being around someone like this? I can't avoid him totally (my grandmother would never cut contact with him, and she is the most important person in my world). Does anyone have a way of looking at this situation that might help me find some peace? Advice on how I could have handled this better? Really, any and all feedback is more than welcome.

I've been with my partner (not married) for 7 years now.  We used to live separately (but within walking distance) but we've now lived together for 2.5 years.

&#x200B;

He has anger issues (which have caused issues not only with me but also with his family and friends at times). He also tends to seek attention from other women. These are the 2 main problems in our relationship. For his part, he feels I punish him far too long for ""mistakes"" (I don't consider them mistakes) and when I do he ends up texting other women which just creates so many more problems.

&#x200B;

I love him, but logically I *know* he's a jerk. He's had these issues in previous relationships as well and his ex's have no contact with him (except for his daughter's mother, but she clearly dislikes him). 

&#x200B;

My main issue is that we constantly follow the same pattern:

1. He does something pretty awful (physical abuse, gets caught lying, gets caught being inappropriate with another woman)
2. I leave and go to my brother's house and my partner and I argue through text.
3. He apologizes, downplays what he's done, says I have contributed to this behaviour in various ways, apologizes some more.
4. He begs me to come back, says he loves me, we are soulmates and can get through anything.

&#x200B;

After several days of resolve, I start to miss him very much. I do love him. I am lonely and just want my life with him back, so I cautiously go back. We make up, he's very affectionate and we fall back into our old life. I feel a lot of relief mixed with annoyance that I am unable to be stronger.

&#x200B;

These aren't minor issues either. The last time I left because he gave me a black eye and a bruised knee. This isn't the first time he's been physically rough with me during a fight. But he kept telling me that I contributed...that he asked me to de-escalate and I refused to (I don't agree with that interpretation but he's adamant that is what happened). 

&#x200B;

Within a week I ended up going back because he begged me, told me he couldn't live without me, refused to eat and plus I simply missed him terribly.

&#x200B;

But at the end of the day, I have to look at myself in the mirror with a fading black eye and realize he doesn't even cringe when he sees it. In fact, he tells me that if I insist on escalating things when he warns me not to that this is what will happen. He doesn't seem ashamed at all. And so I know it will likely happen again, and even though we are acting like everything is A OK, it isn't. I just want to have a nice life with him (and 80% of the time it IS a nice life). But that makes me overlook horrible behaviour. Any idea on how I can get past this? I don't know HOW to leave for good.

We met on a dating app, and he is an international student. The country that he comes from is developing, but the people are generally pretty poor.

&#x200B;

In the beginning, I sort of had this notion in my head regarding his upbringing. The little tidbits of information that he told me led me to believe his dad was physically abusive, and that he basically struggled a lot to get here and struggles to survive now as well. He also told me he wasn't interested in dating a woman from his own country because they were money-hungry and focused on the material things their SO could give them. Due to all of these little pieces of information, and the way he reacted when asked about his family and childhood, I didn't push too hard for fear of bringing up bad memories for him.

&#x200B;

However, recently I  began to question things. Obviously he has to pay pretty high tuition to attend college here. Last year, he was on a graduate assistant-ship program which paid for his fees, and he was dating another girl at the time. Their relationship as a whole lasted nine months, but they were long distance and were friends first.

&#x200B;

Right now, his fees are about $10k a semester for tuition. He also lives in an apartment, and does not have a job even though he had multiple chances to get one on campus. He turned them down, because he, ""didn't come here to work in the school's kitchen as a cook."" He also makes fun of my minimum wage job. Obviously I have always been curious about how he affords this, but never really thought it was appropriate to ask.

&#x200B;

He actually volunteered to me that his best friend of three years (we'll call him Samuel. Samuel is gay- not sure if this is relevant) pays $2000 of his fees. He also has friends in his community paying for part of his fees, and he puts the rest on credit cards.

&#x200B;

In addition to this, I also found out that his dad was never physically abusive, just emotionally- not that this isn't serious- it is. It's just different than what I had thought he meant when he first told me. Also, he and his siblings actually grew up extremely rich and privileged, and he told me his dad always sent them to the best schools and gave them pretty much whatever they wanted.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The reason all of this information is pertinent to this post, is that he had previously been asking me to pay for his groceries, buy him a few things here and there such as cleaning supplies, dinner, or whatnot. And because I thought he had such a rough upbringing and was struggling so hard here, I always obliged.

&#x200B;

He has never gotten me anything for my birthday, Christmas, or Valentines Day, but I always chalked it up to him being poor at the moment. It's not that I expect gifts, even though I have gotten him gifts for each holiday. Something as simple as a home cooked meal or home-made letter would have sufficed, y'know? Really the only thing he has ever bought for me was a three dollar fast food meal once. Which would be fine, but it's the unequal-ness and the way he has handled this whole thing that makes me feel kind of weird about it all.

&#x200B;

In the middle of last semester, he told me he needed to focus on school and getting an internship and that we needed to take a break. However, he still asked if I would bring him things he needed.

&#x200B;

I felt weird about doing it, because it's not like I'm living with him, and he rarely even cooks dinner for me. However when I would voice my concerns, he would get demeaning and accuse me of being stingy and unwilling to help him. He told me in the beginning that he broke up with his other gf because she, ""was unwilling to do things for him"" but didn't specify what they were, so obviously wanting to prove that I was ""better"" than her, I obliged to everything he asked of me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Recently he has asked if I will buy him new airpods, because he lost one. I feel like this is kind of a redundant question to ask, but why is he doing all of this? Am I basically just being used? I just cannot picture why the other girl stuck around for so long if he was treating her the same way. I can't imagine that she got to see his true colors since they were in an ldr, but I am just confused. I feel like it's obvious I'm being used, but I guess I just need to hear your guys' take on it? Should I bring these concerns up and see his reaction?

TL,DR: When my sister doesn’t get what she wants, she is abusive to everyone in my family. I am worried about my parents because she is so harmful towards them. 

She is a high school student, she is bold and she likes to rebel. My family is pretty lenient with her, allowing all sorts of freedom such as letting her boyfriend stay a few nights overnight (in bed with her) and letting her drive off to see her friends at a moment’s notice. Then when she doesn’t get her way, she yells. She calls other people in our family horrible people, she punches, she calls my mom a bitch, she is relentless. Whenever I trust her with more confidential information, maybe information I don’t want my mom to know, she uses it against me in arguments. She threatens. She barely appreciates anything anyone else does for her: in the last weeks I’ve helped her study for the SAT’s, sometimes I’d do something unexpected like cook her breakfast, I’ve given her advice, listened to her, and supported some of her bolder choices. She blows up our house every few days and then when the anger calms down, she comes back crying saying she’s sorry. But days later - same thing.

Here’s an example. She recently posted a comment on Facebook in support of the BLM movement, except the comment was notably provocative. I as well as the rest of my family strongly support the movement - I’ve been sharing posts and donating and signing petitions. When my mom saw her comment she told her to take it down because we have family on there and younger family members on there who don’t want to see her post swear words and references to Nazi’s. The concern here isn’t as much her comment as it was her reaction to my mom asking her to take it down. She screamed and called us moderate bootlicking dumbasses, and questioned our understanding of history, claiming that only provocative statements and violence make change. Sure I see the argument for violence/provocation but a) my mom was a political science major and I minored in history in uni so we know a thing or two about politics b) her response was extremely disrespectful. In the past weeks my family and I have been setting up the house trying to congratulate her on standardized testing, and now all of our work feels useless because why do all of this for her if she’s just going to treat us like shit? She has made all of our family members cry so many times in the past week and her response? More “fuck you” to us. She doesn’t have a heart. I’ve told her that by continually making these empty promises she is losing my trust and she said I don’t care. I would cut her out completely but she makes such impulsive decisions that I really worry for her safety. But after today something just broke in me. I can’t care anymore. I’m so tired.

Also: she does have depression, she has seen therapists and she’s on meds, but I don’t think it’s enough. I’m just wondering much of it is depression and how much of it is her character. I mean is she a sociopath? I think this surpasses immaturity. I want to look into sending her to a mental hospital because I have to move for my job and I can’t protect my parents from her during her last year staying with them at home. I can take her anger but they can’t. They’re old and they’ve done enough. I sincerely would call the cops on her given her behavior but I don’t trust the cops. Also, I don’t think that would do any good for her. She just doesn’t face consequences. Apparently seeing your family members in pain isn’t enough of a consequence.

My heart feels heavy. I read that silent treatment is a form of emotional abuse and that's what I'm doing to my younger sister for over a year.

We live in the same house but I miss her so much. She used to be my best friend. I started not talking to her when I realized how she doesn't respect me. When she puts her mind into something, it's so hard to convince her otherwise, even trivial things. You can't tell her she's wrong because she wouldn't believe you. I'm the eldest, so it's kinda my responsibility to be the ""mom"" when mom is not around, and I didn't like how she expected me to serve her.

Of course, I have my faults too. I know I can be very bossy (I'm working on it now because I don't want to ruin my relationship to my two other younger siblings). Our personalities just don't match.

So I thought, if she can't respect me, there's no point in talking to her. I was hurt a few times the way she treated me but you know siblings fight. I wanted to hurt her too. 

I am still hurt. I want to forgive her so much but I can't. She tried a few times to talk to me vaguely as if nothing is wrong and I got so annoyed. Seeing her face reminds me of her personality. I know it's childish. Throughout the year, I only saw what's bad about her.

I hate that I'm mentally abusive but I can't stop. I'm actually crying as I'm writing this. I miss my best friend. I'm the only one who can easily make her laugh until she's crying and I haven't heard that laugh for so long.

Our family is not very confrontational so I'm afraid to say I'm sorry. I'm also scared that she probably thinks that none of this is her fault, and she'll continue treating me the way she did before if I just act like nothing was ever wrong in the first place (yeah I'm a bad person). 

I don't know what to do. I also know I'm a horrible person but I'm trying to change because I don't want to lose any more family.

I don't want to keep hurting her but I can't stop myself. Am I the bad guy here acting like a victim? What should I do to correct the situation?

Hi, this is my first time even using reddit let alone making a “throwaway” and posting this online. I am simply out of options and scared and not sure where to go and what to do. I apologise if any of this comes harshly or if it’s riddled with typos. I’m just so scared. 


Backstory: My parents are in a terrible toxic marriage that is unlikely to ever end for many reasons that aren’t all relevant to the issues I’ll go into. We are Muslims but I ask you don’t judge this situation from a religious perspective, I only mention this because it will be relevant later on. 


Basically, my dad has always been emotionally abusive to my mum and made her life very difficult. Unsurprisingly then, ever since I was about 11/12, my mum has had an online affair with a man she met through a Facebook forum. I would hear them talk and would see text messages from a young age but my mum would always deny and I used to have full faith in her and would believe what she said, however this didn’t last long. I will skip a few years (forgive me, I’m not the best storyteller under these circumstances) but throughout my adolescence, our family had many many problems and my parents have come to the brink of divorce many times. My mum has even been to the hospital for accidentally cutting herself with a knife after a particularly emotional call with her affair man (fucker? the fucker). There were times when my dad would leave for a few days and return. I know a divorce would have made sense to a lot of people but unfortunately, my dad is too selfish and my mum is too “selfless” on our (my 14 year old brother and I) behalf. I have explained many times to them both I would prefer they get a divorce but it just isn’t an option at this point, they aren’t willing to go through one this late into their lives. 


So yeah, she would talk to the fucker and tell him everything about her life. She’s told me he has helped her with her problems and genuinely in the beginning he seemed to make her feel better. They never met up or anything, it was all done through social media and mainly Whatsapp. Anyway, I noticed a few years into the affair that their relationship started to become quite aggressive on his side and I sensed he was very manipulative and toxic for my mother. At this point, my mum is unaware I know about the affair and thinks her loud whispers and her secretly sneaking into my room at night to text him from my phone so my dad wouldn’t realise all happened under my nose. I would say I’m a good actress to the point she didn’t realise I knew about the affair until maybe two weeks ago but frankly, I’m just so completely numb and depressed I can’t bring myself to care about it, especially with how bad my dad treats her. I was also young and I had no clue what to do. 


I know that many times she has tried to end the affair but he somehow manipulates or threatens her into staying, and it has caused problems with my relatives where he contacts and attacks them through social media whenever she tries to break things off. My mum has denied the affair and they believe her, simply thinking him to be a hacker. However, two weeks ago, I found out he hacked her photos years ago and stole photos of my mum without her hijab all dressed up. This is where I ask you all to please consider this from a Muslim woman’s perspective. Despite everything she has done, the hijab is a very sacred thing to my mum and she wears it proudly. She never meant for the man to find these photos and she’s distraught from having a man she isn’t married to see her without her hijab. I know - believe me, I KNOW - this makes her sound like a hypocrite and I am not defending my mum’s actions, especially with how much she’s hurt me over the years, but if those photos were released she wouldn’t be able to bear it. 


Now recently, she confessed everything to me and I told her I knew. She is now counting on me to help her which I have been doing. For the past few days, I have been texting the man as if her were an “uncle” I could trust and reach out to for help about what to do with my mum. We have been pretending that my mum has left the house from the stress of the affair and returned extremely depressed and closed off from everyone to try to scare/worry him into leaving us alone. I have pleaded, begged, done everything I could when texting him to make him feel sorry for us and the situation he’s supposedly put us in. Context: he’s mentioned repeatedly he sees me as a daughter because of my mum telling him everything about us over the years. I completely hate that she did that but it seems to be working in our favour right now as there is at least a familiarity between us when we speak. The problem is, he’s very manipulative and cruel, willing to blackmail someone he’s been having an affair with for years, who he claims to love, and I don’t know what to do. He’s in another country where the police wouldn’t do shit to help us, the police here wouldn’t do shit to help us, so it’s all in my hands. I’m so worried for my mum that this situation will end up hurting her even more. I’ve tried to text with the man and reason with him but he doesn’t seem to listen. I’ve asked him to leave my mum alone but he’s convinced she loves him and wants only him. 


Is there anything at all I can do? I’ve tried to tell her that her photos being released wouldn’t be the end of the world and it’s not her sin to worry about, but I know it hurts her and I hate to see her like this. My mum is very fragile, much more child-like and naive than I am. I have been the person to guide her through life but it seems I’ve found myself in a situation I can’t work my way out of.

I have an unhealthy relationship with my family (but it's mostly my mom/parents; check out previous post). Each one of them has physically hurt me before. There were times when I feel comfortable around them but not fully.

Lately, they have been motivated to move to Canada because the future in the Philippines is just not promising enough anymore. I've seen people with decent jobs retire and yet, not live a prosperous life afterwards.

I've always wanted to move there. Problem is, I don't think I can bear living with them for a long time, or a year at least. Also, I've been dating someone (M26) who told me he doesn't picture himself moving overseas.

I want to convince him that life is much better there compared to the circus happening in our country right now. We really love each other and we definitely see a future together. But he sees life too simply sometimes. One time he told he he will make do with whatever is offered to him. If that's the case, then I hope he applies that kind of thinking and realizes the advantages he will experience when he move away with me. Sure, Canada is not paradise, but compared to the clownery happening in our country right now and in the future, it is.

He has this dedication towards whatever job is thrown at him and delivers— that's what made me attracted to him at first. I still love this trait about him and I hope he applies this if ever everything falls into place and he changes his mind and goes with me there.

I'm really torn whether I should sacrifice the stress I would endure with my family when this pushes through just so the application would easier as I'm not alone or stay at least for another year here and apply the emigration all by myself. 

This is a lifelong goal and a huge leap now that someone I love is involved. But what scares me the most is when I ask this to him and I don't get the answer I'm expecting and it might be the end of us.

We had opposed it when the government made child rape laws gender-neutral ... If made gender-neutral, rape laws will not have the deterrence value and it will make it more complicated for judges in court."" International human rights lawyer and activist Vrinda Grover was quoted in the same article: ""**There are no instances of women raping men. I don't think men are facing serious sexual violence as [sic] women. Consider the brutality and intensity of sexual violence against women**.""[58]

His reply: Absolutely! There's no doubt about it! Because they're loved by *Krishnā*, an incarnation of *Vishnu*, one of the tri deities in Hinduism. When the supreme god loves something so much, you just accept it. 

What the fuck?!😡

He's absolutely sure that this so called *Krishnā* exists and any sins one does can be absolved once you surrender yourself to him. 

He says this a lot because he has committed violence against my mother many times and he knows I'm furious at this. So it's a way of saying that he's not going to be punished for his sins. 

I'm so fucking done with him😡

## An Introduction 

The term Hindu basically means an inhabitant of Indus Valley. Hinduism is a term given by the Britishers. 

The original name is Sanātan Dharma. Dharma here does not mean religion only, it's a mix of duties, responsibilities, rules and philosophies preached by various sages, gods, scholars and critics during various eras and epochs. 

Four epochs: 
Sat yuga, Tretā Yuga, Dwāpar Yuga and Kal Yuga

each having 1/4th less duration and dharma than the previous, with a proportion of 4:3:2:1 (Sat most, Kal least). These four yugas combined make a larger cyclic age called a yuga cycle. It's currently Kal Yuga going on. This is supposed to be a time period when humanity is at its lowest. After that, it's dooms day and sat yuga begins again. 

Vedic Era: Early, Late and Post

Four Vedas:  Rig Veda, Sām Veda, Yajur Veda, Atharva Veda

## Patriarchy

Hinduism is patriarchal, no doubt about it. 

Supreme Gods, viz Brahmā, Vishnu and Mahesh (Shiv) are all male with some combination of polygamy, sexism, misogyny and patriarchy or some combination of these. 

Hinduism is very wast with tons of scripts and innuendos hence pointing out misogyny and sexism is difficult because as it infiltrates the minds of the readers very eloquently. It's very hypocritical. For better understanding, try reversing roles, you'll understand. 

The righteousness of Hinduism is itself misogynistic, sexist and objectified women as theu are seen as someone to either extol as Goddesses and mothers (to continue the patriarchy, ofc) or as Vaishyā (lit: prostitute) or as tools of transaction and any assault is meant to strip her off her power, respect and position in the society. 

Hindu mythology reveals that patriarchy, the idea that men are superior to women, was invented. The epic, Mahabharata, for example, refers to a time when there was no concept of marriage. 
Men and women were free to go to anyone, until it became important to establish fatherhood (‘this son is mine’), for which ownership and fidelity of women became critical (‘she is the field for my seed’).


## Gender norms

The belief is that sex comes from flesh but you have to obey the gender norms as long as you're in that flesh before you take a rebirth or attain salvation. 

Basically, it's inherently sexist as they're told to do their duty based on their gender but once you die, you're free. Even after death, you ain't free because some bs god will come and recount what """"sin"""" you had committed in your xth birth which you don't even remember and punish you in this birth thereby forcing people to act according to those norms. 

There are the characteristics of great wives as listed in the Puranas – dignity, patience, diplomacy, resourcefulness, drive to succeed, looking out for the family etc.

And those dharma that needs to be obeyed is different for each gender. 

Male dharma is protection, fathering children and providing a son for the clan. 

Female dharma is obeying the head of the household which is always a man, motherhood, compassion and empathy which also means that women perform emotional labour and provide emotional sustenance to men with little or no benefits. 


## Twisting misogyny into piety

Hinduism has a very eloquent way of hiding misogyny by stating that it's a good thing.
People: ""This is misogynistic!"" 
Hinduism: ""No. This is because women are above men/ respected etc""
You'll understand what I'm saying later in this article.  Good examples are goddess worship and kanyādān. 

## Goddess worship

Goddess worship is very much a part of the patriarchal and casteist practices of Hinduism, masked as ‘respect for women’.

When you use divinity to negotiate with patriarchy, it poses another set of problems. Why associate feminity with divinity?

This implies that a mortal female body won't be allowed to occupy spaces and won't be given the opportunities that a body associated with divinity will? 

Goddess worship does not translate into better life opportunities for women. It is a token, merely symbolic representation. The trope of Nārī Shakti (woman power) and goddess worship is Hinduism’s oldest trope, absolving itself from patriarchy and caste discrimination that it is deeply rooted in. It mechanically responds to claims of lack of representation by pointing out that by the virtue of worshiping a female body, they distance themselves from all accusations.



## Concept of virginity

Ancient Indians deliberately praised dependent virgins as ideal women. 

Five maidens (Panca kanyā) as ideal wives:

Ahalya Draupadi Sita,Tara Mandodari tathal
Pancha kanya smarenityam, maha pataka nashanamll

Translation: Mediating on the merits of the five great ladies, namely Ahalya, Draupadi, Sita, Tara and Mandodari, helps destroy even the greatest of sins. 

More about these five ladies: 
1. Ahalya was raped. (I'll explain more in Ramāyana)

2. Draupadi had multiple husbands. (I'll explain more in Māhābhārata)

3. Sitā was accused of having sons by another man. (I'll explain more in Ramāyana)

4. Tara was married to her younger brother-in-law after her husband was killed by him.

5. Mandodari was the wife of a serial womaniser.

All of their mothers were absent in one way or another. 

(Note: Kanyā (maiden) is only used for virgin female. Kanyā is also the Sanskrit name for the zodiac Virgo which itself symbolises a virgin maiden. Woman's virginity and chastity in those times (even today) were (are) seen as high value traits.)


## Objectification of women

Hinduism also treats women as property - the field (woman) must be given to a man who has seed (i.e is fertile, no problems with sperm). Whoever doesn't have seed is unworthy to possess a field (woman). Yes, they also needed to produce sons.


## Glorification of female reproductive ability

In the patriarchal society, the figure of mother symbolises the ever nurturing, unconditionally loving and prosperous nature of the nation state. 

To be born in and brought up by this symbolic mother which comprises of land, resources, institutions, law, citizens etc imposes as a fact that motherhood is absolute. The mere praise and importance given to motherhood sends an unspoken message to the audience, especially young girls whore are vulnerable and naïve. 
Since nation=mother=woman, when a woman is ‘defiled’ the mother nation is defiled too. You protect the chest where your treasure lies, you protect the body where your honour resides. Protection requires constant surveillance, control (through physical and ideological means) and sometimes violence. 

It kind of justifies and encourages the societal sexist restrictions on women’s lives and control on their sexualities.


## Female nudity, sex and perversion

Mahishāsur got boon to be killed by a naked lady by a male god (note: wtf why did that """"god"""" even give such a boon is beyond me). 

Durga stripped to lose his power and he was killed. She became angry when found herself nude and covered her body with garland and belt made from skulls and created havoc in the world.

She covered her lower body later with skull garlands and belts made of chopped hands.

Mahishāsur was enchanted by her physical beauty. He can't possess her but wanted to see her naked (voyeurism) so that only naked lady can kill him. She removed her clothes so that the enemy loses his power just like Amazon woman exposed their breasts in front of army of Lailtaditya.

She sacrificed her dignity and went nude to save her and the gods.

At the end she calmed down when she had sex with Shiva in viparita rati(cowgirl) position. (This sends a very dangerous message that sex is used to calm a woman's anger. )

Chinnamasta and Tripura sundari are also nude. Chinnamasta is dominating parvati in viparita rati angered by ejaculation. Tripura sundari lived on isolated Mani dweep in Pamira(Sarvaloka) sitting naked on lap of Shiva with her body smeared with sandalwood paste. Tara wears tiger skin but is topless. (Wtf I honestly don't see the point of this bs)


## Cancelling women/ preferring sons 

Krishnā had 10 sons and 1 daughter from each of them. The daughter, of course, wasn't in the limelight. In fact, she was deliberately 'hidden"" and was never spoken much about. 

Rāma had a sister but not many people know about it. 

Gāndhari was blessed to have one hundred sons (not a single daughter) so she asked to have one daughter. 

Same story everywhere, the daughter is  """"hidden"""". 

This bs led to massive female foeticides and infanticides across India to the point that PNDT (Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques) Act 1996 was enacted to ban sex determination and sex selective abortions. (Abortions are legal since 1971 in India). The result? Men outnumber women on a massive scale. 

*India currently has 48 million more men than women.* 

Rudram, hymn to praise Shiva can only be chanted by men. (Their logic? Because the pronounciation of those sounds can harm female reproductive system LMFAO)

Only men can enter the temple of Shani and worship him. The reason? Because this so-called god of justice, Shani can't control his own urges. So what to do? Keep women out. Same story for Hanumān who is celibate.

Only sons or men can cremate dead people. 


## Marriage in Hinduism

Kanyādan (lit: donating a daughter) is a ritual in marriage where the father 'hands over' his daughter to her husband. This bs is considered very pious. This is the prime example of Hinduism twisting misogyny into piety. Note that he is donating his daughter. That means she can never go back or that she has no autonomous rights. 

Married woman is addressed as Saubhāgyavati (lit: blessed) as if marriage is some sort of blessing. 

Hinduism says that someone infertile doesn't have the right to be married or in a relationship.

The whole concept of marriage and sex is revolved around producing sons.

*A man and his ancestors go to hell if he doesn't produce a son who can do the last rites (shrāddha) after he dies.* A man can take another wife if the first wife doesn't deliver a son.

If man is either impotent or has a serious disease, he can appoint another man to impregnate his wife. This is called niyoga.

People were not supposed to have sex unless it was for producing babies. But I doubt if many really followed this rule to the letter.


## Widowhood

Widowhood is a feared thing in Hinduism to the point they use ""Saubhāgyavati bhav"" (lit: may you stay forever Saubhāgyavati {lit: blessed}) as a blessing to women but this isn't given to married men. Men, married or not, are usually blessed with long life.  

Widow women have to wear white sari devoid of any jewelry or makeup. Basically, act like a hermit or a recluse. Shaving their heads, sati and making them out as bad omens is also common. 


## The Practice of Sati (Widow immolation)

Goddess Sati immolated herself because her husband was humiliated, he wasn't dead and this is primarily what triggered Sati pratha (practice of Sati) where the wife immolates herself on the burning pyre of her husband.

It was due to Raja Ram Mohan Roy's efforts that it was stopped in India. 


## Casteism

The Hindu right wing has iconised Kali as the flagbearer of ‘Hindutva feminism’. They glorify her victory against asuras and have immortalised her as the divine manifestation of Nāri Shakti bs (female power). But the asuras (demons) and dānavas (monsters) she slays, are Dalit (untouchables) and Ādivāsī (tribal) people, that Brahmanical Hinduism portrays as perpetrators of crime and violence. 



## Justification of Male violence

The Mahabharata, Book 3: Vana Parva: Tirtha-yatra Parva: Section CXVI 

The crime his mother Renuka committed:

""Now once upon a time, when her sons had gone out for the purpose of gathering fruits, Renuka who had a pure and austere life, went out to bathe. And, O king, while returning home, she happened to cast her glance towards the king of Martikavata, known by the name of Chitraratha. The king was in the water with his wives, and wearing on his breast a lotus wreath, was engaged in sport. **And beholding his magnificent form, Renuka was inspired with desire. And this unlawful desire she could not control** , but became polluted within the water, and came back to the hermitage frightened at heart""

Her punishment:

""And then Rama, the slayer of hostile heroes, came to the hermitage, last of all. Him the mighty-armed Jamadagni, of great austerities, addressed, saying, 'Kill this wicked mother of thine, without compunction, O my son.' **Thereupon Rama immediately took up an axe and therewith severed his mother's head**""

Moral of the story: don't find anyone outside of your husband attractive or you'll get decapitated by your own son

Bs HinduMorality y'all! (note: eye roll)

It's Parshuram the 6 avatar of Vishnu. Dasharath's son Ram is the 7th avatar (the one in Ramāyana). Parshuram was a weird character who purged Kshatriyas from the earth 21 times over.


## Krishnā (The same god ISKCON loves so much)

Krishnā, considered the Supreme God as he himself says so in Māhābhārata and Bhagwat Gītā, is a polygamist paedophilic gambler, philanderer, had many wives, married 8 yr old Rukhminī and a romantic relationship with Rādhā, his first cousin. He also called women and people of lower castes as those of sinful births. 

Krishnā, an incarnation of Vishnu, had 16108 wives in total. His principal wives were Rukhminī, Satyabhama, Jambāvati, Nagnajati, Kalindi, Mitravrinda, Bhādrā, and Lakshmana. 

He rescued 16,100 women from Narakāsura who had forcibly kept them in captivity in his palace. He married them all to protect their honour.

Indicating that man is required to restore the honour of women taken away by another man, in this case, an asura (demon). 

Krishnā is always alone in Māhābhārata and nowhere were any of his wives portrayed nor did they effectively help him in ruling, making decisions and governing. 


## Hindutva apologists 

(Hindutva: Hindu ideology)

In these series of dissecting Hinduism, I'll try my best to prevent Hindutva supremacists from defending this patriarchal, sexist and misogynistic ""religion"" (or dharma) they keep portraying as ""feminist"" just because it has Goddesses and that they worship female power or some other bs. 

Indians LOVE to throw the blame of patriarchal, sexist and misogynistic India on foreign invasions, especially Britishers and Mughals. 

While, Christianity and Islam are also misogynistic and oppressive, throwing the blame at these religions does not absolve Hinduism of its own shortcomings. 

Another bs argument they come up with is that this is very old. So if it's old why hasn't this bs tossed into the dustbin already?! These jerks are the same ones who will come here brigading the sub. 


Thank you so much for reading!😊

Author's note: I'm very sorry for the delay. I'm a med student and this coronavirus isn't helping. This was an overview keeping in mind that majority of people in this sub don't know enough about Hinduism and help them get an idea. I'll be dissecting other scripts in my future posts. I'm sorry for wrong formatting, poor writing skills or any mistakes. I felt VERY uncomfortable writing some WTF and NSFW parts. I welcome any questions, clarifications or feedback😊 I'll dissect Rāmāyana next. 

TL;DR: HINDUISM IS TRASH.

758,37,40,"Dear ""feminists""",120.0,ghpfi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ghpfi5/dear_feminists/,121.0,1589238911.0,"[Effort Post] A feminist is a person who believes in the social, political and economic equality of all the sexes.
Feminism is not only about women, it is about humanity. Then why do we make it all about women, that they're the only one facing discrimination? Ever heard about 'pussy pass'?

First of all, 'equality' here is not 'equality of outcome'  rather it is 'equality of opportunity'.
‘Equality of Outcome’ requires that individuals have some share of goods. ‘Equality of Opportunity’ requires that people ought to be able to compete on a “level playing field”.
So, having share based on some group's representation in population is not ""feminism"".

Secondly, women and men are equal (in terms of value) not same (physically, physiologically, psychologically, emotionally). So first understand what 'equal' means.
What irks me is the number of people who reduce feminism to blindly agree to everything a woman says or continually reinforcing a woman’s belief in her ability to do ‘anything a man can do’. You can't do all the things a man can do , and you shouldn't try to either.

Thirdly, ‘Woman empowerment’ is another term thrown around like plastic wrappers in India.
Sex, drugs and profanity on the daily is not 'women empowerment' as some movies and TV shows nowadays would like you to believe. Reducing the cut-off percentage for girls in DU colleges isn’t empowering anyone except those already empowered; true empowerment would come around only when every girl in the remotest village of this country goes to school without once thinking that she’s lucky to be able to do so. I don’t see why a woman should need a lower percentage to qualify anyway. Education should always be a level playing field. Equality is in equal opportunity.

Fourthly, majority of ""feminists"" are hypocrites. A woman could literally get away with anything by ending her sentence with ‘because Feminism’. No, you do not deserve an added portion of respect just because you happened to be born a girl. You deserve the same amount of respect as any other human being. Whatever respect you get after that depends on how you earn it. Don’t tell me I’m supposed to know how to talk to ‘ladies’ because I don’t. I know how to talk to human beings and I’m sorry if that’s not enough for you, but that’s my idea of equality. Women can wait in line for their turn and can offer a seat to a man.
If a women accuses a man of sexual assault he's automatically the culprit. As we've recently seen in 'boislockeroom' controversy and on countless other occasions. No one knows if they're culprit or not, but there are screenshots and a women accused them so it must be true.
Bill Maher, the comedian pointed out, in one of his stand-ups, that if someone said men were smarter than women, there would be a chorus of disagreeable challenge; however, if one said that women were smarter than men, everyone would cheer almost reflexively because that’s just how society is. We’re selectively moral. We pick and choose the values and morals and ethics we’d like to follow as per our own convenience. That's not how feminism or pseudo-feminism works.

Fifthly, Feminism’s goal is to create a society where men are taught that expressing their feelings does not make them less of a man and where women are taught that they are strong too. It wants a society where men are no longer taught that “crying is for girls” so that they can actually communicate their feelings and problems and have more successful relationships with women throughout their lives. It is men who mostly suffer with depression, anxiety, suicide, loneliness. They are seldom complemented, appreciated, and guided. They are supposed to figure out life on their own, be successful, not be emotional, provide for family and be strong. But no one tells them 'how?’ 1 in every 10 rape victims is a man. Men are not supposed to talk about sexual assault because then they're 'pussies' and are supposed to consider themselves 'lucky'. 
Feminism wants a society where men aren’t expected to always be the moneymaker of a family and women are able to provide for themselves without expecting a man’s support. 90% of women marry a man who earns equal or more that them. If a man stays at home, takes care of children, and his wife earns, then he's a loser somehow, but a housewife is a ""shero"".
Feminism wants a society where a woman is seen as an individual before she is seen as a sexual being or a baby maker and where a man and woman can be seen equally as parents and treated fairly in parental or custodial issues.
So the next time you throw that word around unthinkingly, ask yourself, are you even worthy of using that term?",2020.0,5.0,12.0,05:00:11,,10

Born in Zanzibar in 1943, Sandhu emigrated to Britain in 1962 and became a nurse. Her dream had always been to join to police, however, and on the 1st February 1971, she was sworn in as a WPC of the London Metropolitan Police. Despite the objections of her family and community, the demands of raising two small children with little help from an unenlightened husband, and the rampant race and sex discrimination of the Met, she battled on and achieved her goal.

In her short time on the force, she commended herself to the community and her fellow officers. Her chief superintendent wrote in a report that she was ""proving invaluable with our dealings with the immigrant population, and she is also assisting other divisions in this work, and also teaching police officers Asian dialects.""

Her battles with her husband continued throughout this time. He condemned her choice of career as ""un-Asian"" and ""unladylike"", and left her for India, taking their two children with him. But Sandhu kept fighting him, and managed to get her children back.

This woman had managed to wrest control over her own life from those who tried to tie her down. She had won her own job, her own home, her own children. So her husband used the final weapon at his disposal. He returned to London and, on the 4th November 1973, attacked her outside her home with a knife. Sandhu immediately recalled herself to duty and, unarmed though she was, attempted to arrest her husband, her final act of defiance. He stabbed her in the neck, his final act of control.

Sandhu was murdered for her tireless pursuit of her dreams and her freedom, at the age of 30. Her husband was sentenced to life in prison. It is fitting that neither of the articles from which this story is drawn name him. Let his name be forgotten. Let Karpal Kaur Sandhu's brief and courageous life be remembered, forever.

There are still more male rapists due to higher rates of male-on-male rape compared to female-on-female rape, but neither stat is very high in absolute terms. Contrary to what you've probably heard in the past, most men are not raped by other men. ~80% are raped by women. And more men in total are raped every year than women, making sexual assault more of a men's issue than a women's issue.

Lifetime stats follow this as well, but not as closely. Those stats include all forms of sexual abuse, including things like flashing and groping, and they are less accurate than yearly stats for a number of reasons. The largest being because men, over time, will reframe a rape as consensual due to gender norms (everyone telling him he was ""lucky"", like if a teacher did it)... speculation is that women may do the opposite, thus moving their stat in the opposite direction. But even the official, unfiltered lifetime stat isn't that far off: 1 in 4 for women and 1 in 6 for men.

Why is this not very well known?

Several decades ago, an early gender studies ""researcher"" named Mary Koss proposed that a person ""forced to penetrate"" another person is not in fact raped. She called it unwanted sexual contact and she was very successful in convincing academics and even lawmakers to adopt this definition. While technically it is gender neutral, due to the anatomical differences between men and women, it mainly applied to men. Her rationale was that men must ""want it"" or are ""asking for it"" so it doesn't count.

As a result, the true rate of sexual assault against men is usually hidden in official statistics. Instead of rape, they call it ""made to penetrate"". And many state and national laws around the world similarly define rape in gendered terms, meaning female rapists avoid prosecution and generally don't get discussed in the media. This has led to decades of misinformation on the topic. And it has only just recently started getting attention, both on the legal front, and among academics.

Unpopular? Definitely.

Factual? Absolutely.

Inconvenient? Maybe if you're sexist. That is in fact likely the motivation behind people who try to deny it (I'm looking at you, Mary Koss).

I have got a cancellation of my booking, of an under construction apartment, with a RERA judgement along with full refund. But the builder did not heed to the judgement and didn't pay in time. So the recovery process has started and has been lurking around at a snails pace with revenue department, which is a local government body. Since I had already paid 90% of the amount, most of it through a bank loan, I end up paying emi without any respite. But now I have decided enough is enough, I will stop the emi payment. Even if bank were to start the recovery process, it has to go through the same channel of revenue department, which is holding up my RERA recovery as well. So my thinking is I have a very valid and legit reason to stop my payments and let recovery process to take its course.

As we were getting late for an event, and my elderly parents were with me, we booked an auto rickshaw. The auto dropped us almost at the entrance. Later I contacted Uber and asked for a refund as I had to spend additional money to get to my destination, but they said they can't refund because of some policy. I persisted, and contacted them on Facebook and Twitter, but they are not replying. It has been a week with a support ticket opened and no reply.

I’m gonna try and speak to someone else, I’m thinking a Gardaí (Irish cop)


I was told to post this here so here goes.
So this is a throw away account because this is a very sensitive subject and I need some advice but I want to keep this private until I know what I want to do. Sorry about formatting and if this post is a bit all over the place Im trying to get as much info in as I can, and please excuse any spelling or grammar errors in advance, they are not gonna be the main point of this post. So the story is I was with my ex and we had two children together. We weren’t together long when I got pregnant. He started being horrible, calling me names, telling me I’m ruined now because I’m pregnant and that I’m lucky he will stay with me all this stuff, including being racist (I’m Irish he’s Indian) calling me a white whore, saying all white women are noting but sluts because I wasn’t a virgin when I met him (which he knew before we were together) so after my first baby was born the physical abuse started. He would hit and kick me for ages, I’ve had black eyes and busted lips, bruises etc but never anything as bad as a broken bone, but he did chase me around the house with a knife once and I ran out of the house screaming, but no one came, but he did put the knife away then. And the sexual abuse. While he would not physically hold me down and rape me, there would always be some consequence if I said no, his anger, verbal abuse until I agree and his anger would often lead to the physical stuff. He had threatened to sell me to a brothel one time to be raped to death (he said he would bring me to India and do this but there is no chance I would ever go so I know that was an empty threat) and he would want to have sex with me
sometimes 4-5 times a day, I would just sob into my pillow and then he would get really angry about me not being enthusiastic. I’ll also add that he did not care to be careful while I was pregnant and would get annoyed at the fact he couldn’t have sex with me “properly” and once had sex with me so hard I bled and my vagina got extremely swollen and had to go into the hospital. They told him no sex for 8 weeks and he did leave me alone for a while then. So I ended up pregnant again, and the physical abuse continued along with everything else so I finally got the courage to speak out. I told my brother what was happening and he came to the house to confront him about it and my ex ended up hitting me in the head and knocking me over (i was 3 months pregnant with my second baby at this stage) so my bro took me out of the house and brought me to his place with my son.  All of this took place about 6 years ago now. He sees the kids at weekends and he can still be a bit of a dick to me when we have contact so I make sure someone else in the house with me when he comes to take the kids. The only real evidence I have is the time my brother seen him hitting me. I have no photos of bruises or anything like that. I’m wondering if anyone knows if I have any chance of getting some kind of justice against him now? It’s taken me a long time to heal enough and feel strong enough to want to fight this. I’d appreciate any advice anyone would have. Please don’t give me lectures about why I stayed with him as long as I did, it really fucks with your head when you are treated like that for so long and i was on contraception when I got pregnant, it didn’t work.",2020.0,6.0,5.0,06:18:08,,

797,76,97,"The ""men are toxic effect"": a proposed corollary to the ""women are wonderful effect"" that highlights how society has a negative bias towards men (from a new academic paper on gender biases)",338.0,g3n4hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/g3n4hw/the_men_are_toxic_effect_a_proposed_corollary_to/,32.0,1587243616.0,"The so-called ""women are wonderful"" effect is pretty well known (at least around here) and generates a decent amount of discussion. In short, it essentially points out how people often view women more favorably than men in a variety of contexts. In psychology this is known as a ""halo effect"", and is based on the fact that people prefer attractive people over unattractive people.

Well a new paper has coined the ""men are toxic"" effect to go along with the ""women are wonderful"" effect. It acknowledges the dual fact that women aren't just viewed positively, but that men are often viewed negatively:

>Negative attitudes towards masculinity have become widely accepted in mainstream public discourse in recent years. In contrast to the “women are wonderful” effect (Eagly et al. 1991), contemporary men are subject to a “men are toxic” efect. The notion of “toxic masculinity” has emerged and has even gained widespread credence despite the lack of any empirical testing (see chapter on masculinity by Seager and Barry). In general terms it appears as if attitudes to men have been based on generalisations made from the most damaged and extreme individual males. An example of this is the case from 2016, when a young woman called India Chipchase was raped and murdered. There were two men in her story: the rapist/murderer, and her grieving father who movingly stated “I will never get to walk my daughter down the aisle”. However, the media attention following this tragic event focussed almost exclusively on a sense of urgent need to teach boys and men in general to respect women. This suggests that in terms of public attitudes, the rapist/murderer was being viewed as more representative of masculinity than the victim’s father.

And later on:

>There is a serious risk arising from using terms such as “toxic masculinity”. Unlike “male depression”, which helps identify a set of symptoms that can be alleviated with therapy, the term “toxic masculinity” has no clinical value. In fact it is an example of another cognitive distortion called *labelling* (Yurica et al. 2005). Negative labelling and terminology usually have a negative impact, including self-fulflling prophecies and alienation of the groups who are being labelled. We wouldn’t use the term “toxic” to describe any other human demographic. Such a term would be unthinkable with reference to age, disability, ethnicity or religion. The same principle of respect must surely apply to the male gender. It is likely therefore that developing a more realistic and positive narrative about masculinity in our culture will be a good thing for everyone.

So on the one hand they are pointing out the dangers of using this terminology, and how it has become widely accepted despite formal academic scrutiny of the concept calling it into question.

But **it also highlights a way that we can use or** ***""own""*** **this terminology to emphasise the unique ways that men are marginalized in society.**

The often framed ""progressive notion"" of toxic masculinity does nothing to help end gender stereotypes but is instead exemplary of existing stereotypes against men.

It has spread far and wide, and is often used in a regressive manner in order to attack men (regardless if the people using it claim to ""not be attacking men"").  

We can debate the merits of the concept, as well as the intellectual honesty of the people who use it, till we're blue in the face.

Or we can follow up with the ""men are toxic effect"", and discuss how it is in fact a problem that society views men as negative and toxic. In fact, you might say that the concept of toxic masculinity *is often part of the problem*, due to the labelling effect mentioned above (or in layman terms, it sounds offensive, even if it isn't ""supposed"" to).

I would even advocate for half way agreeing with some people in order to throw in the *men are toxic* / *women are wonderful effect*, since toxic masculinity is in theory supposed to be about *society* and how *society treats men*.  So they will either have to agree with you, or out themselves as a misandrist.

I know this kind of stuff usually happens organically but I figured I'd try to throw this out there.

I am not in a position to be without a working laptop for three weeks. This is the third issue in last 1 year, but they are still refusing to issue a replacement/loner device either. The laptop was bought in US (I’m a US resident, not citizen), currently stuck in India due to lockdowns. The Apple store I visited is in India.


I bought a MacBook Pro in Aug 2019, that came with 1yr limited warranty support, ending in Aug 2020. The device has failed multiple times 

1. Keyboard failure (a well known issue) in January 2020. It was sent for repair and Apple fixed it in a week. A repair ID was assigned. 

2. (Probably) A hardware failure, following which the device wasn’t turning ON, in March 2020. I raised a case and it was fixed remotely, via a SMC reset. However the laptop wasn’t sent for actual repair. No repair ID was assigned.

3. Second hardware failure, few days ago. At this point I’m traveling internationally. The laptop isn’t turning ON again. This SMC reset isn’t working and it seems like the logic board has to be replaced. So I bring in the laptop to a local Apple Authorized repair centre (in India, if that matters), and they ask for 3 weeks to get it fixed (since they don’t have the said replacement part in stock).

Since Apple doesn’t have mail in support here, I’ve to travel to a different city and pay for a hotel, for the duration of repair. Not to forget that, I can’t travel to and fro between the cities easily. At this point, I ask them for a loner device or a replacement, because I just can’t give away my primary work device for 3 weeks.

But they refuse, since they have a policy of not replacing a device with less than three repair histories. Which I can understand. I don’t want a new MacBook either. I just need a device to work to work with, for the very least.

I’m coming from the side of being an anti-feminist MRA, and I consider myself well researched, well cited, and rational in my arguments. But I’ve been heavily downvoted.

It was rather shocking to me that the people of people seem to genuinely hold the belief that feminism is a completely equitable and fair movement. While the men’s rights movement is the movement in the moral and intellectual wrong. It was eye opening- I really do live in a bubble and am out of touch with what people think- I thought my views were common knowledge and commonly held.

However, I’m stand by that I’m right.

What I realize is that the knowledge I have isn’t common knowledge and is unknown to most people. To me, the sentence “feminists support discriminatory and sexist laws” is obviously true, because over the years I’ve read many examples and can cite many examples. But the people I debate *dont*, so to them, it sounds like I’m against equality for women (I am not)

This is why I now think the men’s rights movement needs to focus on educating people about what the laws actually are, and explain how feminist organizations are relevant to the issues at hand. In this post, I’m just going to give a few examples. There are many more than just these few, but I don’t want the post to be too long. I’m going to demonstrate examples of feminist organizations support inequality under law that hurts men and boys. I don’t have a laptop STM so this is all on my phone, so it won’t be as well written as I’d like. Sorry about that.

**violencia de genero laws, Spain**

I’ll start with domestic violence laws because they bother me the most, having been personally affected. Feminists support domestic violence laws that have a “gendered” lens, meaning men and women are treated and considered differently by default.

The most extreme example is in Spain, with what’s called the [violencia de genero laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Courts_for_Violence_against_Women). As you’ll see, Spain has a separate justice system to handle domestic violence cases involving women (male victims do not have access to these courts and are treated separately). Under these laws, men can be arrested and jailed without any evidence. Within 72 hours, they appear for trial in one of the special courts. They are not permitted to defend themselves or give any testimony or evidence; they are simply spectators on trial. 

No physical evidence is needed for conviction. A conviction will be handed down as long as the woman’s testimony remains consistent. The sentence is a mandatory 2-5 years in prison. 

So, a man can be sentenced to prison with zero evidence against him, and zero recourse or ability to appeal. Domestic violence against women is the only crime that is handled this way- even murderers as given more opportunities for defense and appeal.

Domestic violence against men is very weakly prosecuted. Usually, a woman will released without charge. She will occasionally be fined. Prison is very rare.  A man who slaps his wife after she hits him will face a harsher punishment than a woman who stabs her husband and sends him to hospital.

As you’ll see in the article, feminists were and still are the main proponents of this law. Many judges protested, calling the law unconstitutional. 

In addition, women receive free housing, monthly compensation and a government job after the accusation. There are [over 100,000 reports a year, and 25,000](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2017/05/31/inenglish/1496243416_419062.html) receive ‘special protection’, the benefits recorder about. (Note, you’ll see male victims included here. This is because they are still covered by law, just to a very different extent)

So this is an example of feminists directly supporting inequality under law.

The US and U.K. have less extreme versions of this, although it varies by jurisdiction. Feminist in the US developed the [duluth model](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth_model), the most widely used procedure model for the US. The Duluth model teaches that can’t be victims of domestic violence, because women are only violent in self defense. I linked to the [criticism page here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth_model#Criticism).

**Employment Equity law, Canada**

The employment equity law is a federal law that has been active since 1995:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_equity_(Canada)

It mandates preference in hiring for 4 groups:

1. Women

2. Minorities

3. Disabled 

4. Native

This means that if a man and woman both apply for a federal job, the woman *must* be hired over a man. The act was revamped in 2019, and it’s now having very severe effects on [male unemployment rates](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/men-male-youth-unemployment-jobs-alberta-1.5389303)- as you’ll see in Alberta, [young male unemployment doubled](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-unemployment-male-youth-feels-dire-1.5390778) in the last year, while women’s stayed the same. This is because it’s impossible for men to get hired when a woman applies for the same job.

Keep in mind, the overall unemployment rate for men in Canada is higher than women’s in all age groups, and by a [significant margin](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-222-x/2008001/sectionb/b-unemployment-chomage-eng.htm)- note for overall youth, female unemployment is at 7.5%, while for young men its 16.8%, more than double. And this doesn’t count those who have stopped looking, which many young men have.

You also get nonsense like this:

[women only jobs for military](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/the-canadian-forces-jobs-where-only-women-need-apply)

[joe bate case](https://torontosun.com/2015/10/28/white-worker-sues-canada-revenue-agency-for-discrimination/wcm/71ed4d61-0d28-46fd-8fe6-61f365241d1a)

Feminists were and are the strongest proponents. This is direct legalized discrimination and difference under law- a man literally has less rights in the Canadian workforce.

And not just of examples of legal inequality, things like the education grading gap- this study from MIT school of Economics (decent source, I’d say) found boys earn [lower grades for the same work](https://mitili.mit.edu/sites/default/files/project-documents/SEII-Discussion-Paper-2016.07-Terrier.pdf), and [other studies back that up](https://www.bbc.com/news/education-31751672)

I could bring up how currently, it’s not illegal to rape men in India. They are literally excluded from the law. Why? [feminist groups directly protested](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms)

Or feminists in the U.K. [protesting equal pension ages](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-women-pensions/british-women-protest-as-their-pension-age-rises-to-meet-mens-idUSKCN1NB2AM) (men must work until older. This is what MRAs call the [retirement gap](https://menarehuman.com/retirement-age/), where because men have to work until older and die younger, they often only get half the years in retirement. (The argument they give about having “time to prepare” is laughably absurd)

So yes, it annoys me when people say “feminism is for equality”, and when people tell me “the men’s rights movement has no valid cause to exist”. This is, quite simply, utter bullshit.",2020.0,4.0,5.0,22:53:59,,72

Turns out I have an active case against me as of 2019:  I was even assigned a lawyer, and I was never notified of any of this.

&#x200B;

Not a letter in the mail, not a phone call, nothing. My location is New York City if that matters.

&#x200B;

In 2018 I went to an Urgent Care clinic in New York City for a simple STD checkup, I was effectively uninsured.  I could have just gone to a free clinic but I am a firm believer that you 'Get What You Pay For', and for this I saw no reason to cheap out for my peace of mind. If you're interested I haven't done the hokey pokey since 2011 but I wanted to be rest assured that I wasn't carrying some venereal disease I could pass on to a potential future partner or a brain eating one.

&#x200B;

The price, they assured me, was all inclusive and was around $340 for everything.  I asked at least three times if I would be billed externally anything additional.  They assured me they had their own labs where they did the tests. I asked one last time before swiping my credit card. For the price, I figured it was OK. If they had told me it'd be nearly $500 I would have refused.

&#x200B;

I asked multiple times for the test results and at first they couldn't even find any record that I had been there. Needless to say, despite multiple requesting it multiple times I never received the results.

I am assuming they would have had to notify me if anything was positive, but I have doubts the proper tests were even ordered seeing as how the entire visit lasted 10 minutes or less and consisted of barely any real communication or asking about what my sexual life was like.

&#x200B;

Months later I started receiving debt collection notices for something between $140 and $180 despite being told explicitly in plain language that there would be no other fees; and so I spoke to the clinic on the phone and explained the situation and as far as I remember they said they would take care of it, and I asked for my test results again which again was never sent.

&#x200B;

Eventually I received a call from the company claiming the debt, I explained to them I spoke to the clinic and they would clear up the confusion. That was the end of it, so I thought.

&#x200B;

I continued to receive notices in the mail from various bulk junk debt purchasers under rotating names, many of whom called me from call centers in India, one of comically cursed me out. Then finally it stopped and I figured it was either finally resolved or like all other junk debt notices it was finally given up on like the overdue membership fees from the Prospect Park Alligator Petting Zoo or the library book I returned late.

&#x200B;

Now I have a pending case against me from a medical diagnostic firm created in 2017 located in a building of 50 other businesses whose lawyers are personal injury car-crash specialists and I am apparently being defended by the ""Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation"".  The kicker is the medical diagnostic firm specializes only in physiological tests (EEGs , EKGs, x-rays, etc.)

&#x200B;

This is my question - What in the seven hells is going on? Did I drive a car into the clinic and forget about it afterwards?  Why was I never served? Why am I being sued by personal injury lawyers and why am I being defended by specialists in motor accident laws? Was I in an accident and this is all a brain damaged hallucination?

&#x200B;

It would have been really lovely if someone, literally anybody involved in this, told me about any of this before assigning me a lawyer from The Incredible Crash Dummies.

Is this legal? Because it sounds way too close to slavery if you ask me, especially for low income families whose monthly salary makes the difference between food and starvation. ""Either work for us for the next 12 months or lose two months of your salary that you have rightfully earned by working for those two months."" It's not like this lockdown was a vacation for the teachers. They were still working from home, making sure whatever paperwork had to be done was done, conducting regular online sessions with their students on Zoom. They continued working from home during April and I am sure the school will still give them plenty of work in May as well. What is really infuriating is the fact that they're doing this despite having special permission from the government to continue taking fees from the parents of students who are enrolled in their school. So basically, the loss in their income was minimal. Despite that, they are holding their teachers' salaries hostage.

But I feel this is a major issue and must have light put on it. I am extremely passionate about the LGBT community, and seeing it being attacked so blatantly, it tears my heart apart.

While these issues are present amongst many creators, I will be highlighting two today.

Ajey Nagar (aka Carryminati) and Lakshay Chaudhary.

These two are widely popular creators on the platform, having over 17 million and 800,000 subscribers, respectively.

They are also incredibly Homophobic, Transphobic, and Misogynistic. They reason this fact hasn't been in the public eye, is due to the main language being Hindi and not English, and therefore having a language barrier protecting them from being exposed.

Recently, Carryminati, a extremely popular YouTuber here in India posted a video called YouTube vs TikTok, which was a video demeaning the TikTok platform, which garnered over 10 MILLION LIKES and 66 MILLION VIEWS before it was deleted by YouTube for Hate Speech.

In it, he attacked a TikTok creator by using Homophobic slurs such as ""Meetha"" (meaning sweet, but used in reference to a lack of masculinity.) and ""Pari"" (meaning Fairy, used to misgender). Later in the video, he says TikTok Creators can be sold in ""Meethai ki Dukaan"" (sweet shop, referring to the Meetha slur) as well as referring the creator as Beti, (meaning daughter, again, misgendering.) 

Due to his wide Influence, his angry fans have now resorted to calling people against Carryminati, as well as TikTok users ""Chakkas"" (Which means Transgender, and is being used as an insult) 

For More Information on this, I'd like if you guys could go see

Secondly, we have Lakshay Chaudhary, who with 800k subscribers, is another Homophobic, Classist, Transphobic and Misogynistic Youtuber on the rise.

Lakshay often suggests that Trans and Gay people should be taken care of by Gangs and Thugs in a violent way, and that guys being with guys and girls being with girls is going to lead to the extinction of humanity. He also often showcases guys being romantic with each other on TikTok in a demeaning way, along with sound effects to suggest it as being a matter to be laughed/scoffed at. He also says that do what God made you do and not things such as this (referring to a man kissing another man on TikTok) and says that he needs to assemble an Anti Bakchodi Squad (Anti Fu*kery Squad ) to fix this. He also says TikTok should change their name to Ling Baldo App (Genital Changer app) and also uses the word Chakka (Transgender in Hindi) as an insult as well.

These memes are basically built around the current problems and situations around, and try to convey it through humour. Some of the memes might offend others thus it is made private so that sensible people may understand the humour instead of bring in any hate and may know about whats going around. 

So the group posted some memes regarding the selection procedure of various MNCs, which I feel that must be questioned and may would agree too. It questioned over the preferential behaviour given to women during selection procedure and how merit was not defining criteria for selection.

The group was reorted by 10-15 people out of 40K people in the group. Initially they were warned by facebook, for spreading mysognistic ideas, and later the group got deleted. A facebook employee, obviously she, was involved in the process.

So the people made another group with decision of not posting such memes that may violate facebook standards. This group didnt had much content in it. However the employee , she, ( personally ) , someone deleted another group aswell, without any warnings because there were none to give. However this is completely against right of speech going in facebook and shows how freedom of speech to question these selection procedures is not allowed there aswell. She employee due to some personal reasons, convinced or whatever, got the group deleted. This is my view , detailed part can be read below.







Actual post:
Freedom of speech and Facebook
Incident - IIM (46k Members) was a meme posting group of coinsting of college students, there was a trend in group to post memes on unfair selection practices by MNC to select only female students, this trend was funny in the beginning and then turned sexist so IIM banned this trend and that caused rise of group Placement Rejection Posting (10k Members and not related to IIM in any way) and they constantly posted stuff about unfair selection practices.
(you know who's) post - This stuff posted on PRP was unacceptable according to (you know who) so he wrote a post about it on facebook and that post gained attention of a lot of people. There is a chat group of seniors in these colleges working in influential companies like Goldman Sachs, Amazon, Google, Facebook etc. this chat group supported (you know who's ) narrative and thought these things are promoting sexism.
Death of IIM with 46k members - IIM had 3-4 community strikes before this whole incident and this is normal for groups with 46k members, In fact I moderated multiple groups before and they were just fine even after 10-12 community violation strikes from facebook. But just after discussion in that influential seniors group we got notification from fb that IIM is deleted. So it is safe to conclude that IIM was deleted by facebook employe because it wasn’t propagating her propaganda or let's assume this was complete coincidence.
Death of IIM 2 with 20k members - After the first group got deleted we created a 2nd group, and we reached 20k members in 1 day with 10k pending requests, this shows that members of IIM loved IIM. So when the 2nd group was created people started roasting (you know who) without using his full name or revealing his identity and also people criticised this authoritarian behaviour of FB employe. Group was just 1 day old, No post violated community standards, Out of nowhere IIM 2 gets deleted without any notification, community strike or warning of any kind. This confirms IIM was taken down by facebook employee, just because it wasn’t fulfilling her narrative.
The bigger picture - From this incident we can see authoritarian behaviour of FB, There is no free will on facebook, facebook will only show you “Right Things” (according to them) and anything against there point of view will be censored or deleted. This is suppression of freedom of speech, 40k members of IIM thought content of IIM is funny and 95% people of IIM thought there is nothing wrong with posts in IIM, I am leaving 5% because some people prefer to be too politically correct so 5% of them might be offended, but those posts didn’t violet any community standards. In this case that FB employee was among those 5% so she decided to delete group even when none of the post violates community standards, So think about bigger picture if Mr. Zucc decides that only liberal/conservative point of view is correct and fb bombarded you with liberal/conservative posts gradually and molded your freewill in the long run, parallelly he also decided to delete every point of views against his ideology. This is worse than censorship from Chinese cummunist party. At least CCP is the government And they have the best interest of their people at the center, In this case your free will is molded by Co-orptrates and they are spreading propaganda which is best in their interest.
So I request you all to share this post or copy paste it on your wall, I think they will delete this page also.

I've read about the different leaves(paid, sick, etc) but I am confused about how much of that is supposed to be mentioned. So, they've mentioned that we can get 1 leave per month and that's it. Should I ask about earned leave/vacation days?  
Also, Is there anything I should pay special attention to?  
Thank you",2020.0,6.0,4.0,07:00:20,,

being from a country like India it is very hard for us to take this problem to notice. so if there are any Indians who can help us out , it would be a major relief for my friend. my friend said he had all the screenshots of the conversations and the necessary  proofs. i was shocked to know that my friend did not even know there are mens right activists out there to help. all those two years he has suffered a lot. any help would be a relief.

A few days ago, I got a call from one of my school mates, who is now a Junior in my college. He explained to me that he has this friend (female) who is struggling with some backs (repetition of failed subjects) from my branch. He then asked me whether I can ""help"" her in those subjects. I, unsuspecting at this point, sent him a few PDFs for subject books to forward her. He then asked me whether he can give her my cell phone number so that she can directly clear her doubts. I agreed reluctantly.
Two hours later, I received a call from her. She said that she has been struggling with this particular subject. Since I had some prior knowledge of it, I inquired about her syllabus, at which point she revealed that it is not her who has the backs but her cousin (male). I grew a little skeptical. She explained that clearing these subjects is vital for her cousin since his degree hangs in the balance. Still suspecting, I added a few friends into the conversation. She then proceeded to send us notes of the subject and asking us to study those. She revealed that the exam was online in a MCQ(multiple choice questions) pattern and she would send us the questions on WhatsApp and expects us to answer all of them. Her cousin said that he had other subjects to study and therefore couldn't prepare for this one. We were not sure whether we should help or not, so we made an excuse that we had not studied that subject in our college.

If this seems circumstantial, later that day, she contacted us again to help her cousin in yet another subject and this has happened four times till now. We have not provided any help and have been making excuses.

Should I report this somewhere or give them benefit of doubt and block them?

I joined my last employer in late 2018. The employer gave me stock options worth X/year. The company is based out of India. I could not exercise the options until 1 year. I received no information regarding stock options even though I followed up with the CEO. Eventually, 1.4 years into the company, I was leaving the company to pursue higher studies and discussed the buyback option with the CEO. The CEO agreed to help me out by paying Y (Y was almost half of the new value of X stock options, but I agreed for I needed quick cash). Even though I pressed him, he didn't put down anything on paper. The only proof that I have stock options is the offer letter I received when I joined the company. The CEO keeps telling me that he'll update me once he has heard from the legal team. I'm just tired of following up about the money (been doing it for 2 months) and need to pay tuition fees.

What should I do?

Now that I searched about them, I am seeing a lot of complaints about them not disconnecting the connection and threatening  customers with legal action, in conclusion making customers pay extra money by delaying disconnection.

I began working at a company in the Bay Area, California, in the middle of August 2019. It’s a small to medium sized start-up. In my employment agreement, which I signed, it stated I must return my sign-on bonus in the event my employment with this company ends, for any reason, within 12 months.

Come March 31st, I am laid off due to COVID-19. As I’ve only worked at the company for 8 months, they want me to return my $10,000 sign-on bonus ($6,200 net of taxes). So I review my original employment agreement, and it does not state a specific date at which this $6,200 must be returned. It states the following, “Any such bonus payments made would be payable back to Company if your employment with Company is terminated, for any reason, before 12 months from start date.” That’s it.

Flash forward to today, and I’m struggling to come to agreement with this employer as to when this money will be returned. It peaked when I received an email today stating that:

* My previous employer will contact my new employer 
* My previous employer will be contacting their lawyers

Unless I repay the $6,200 immediately. So my questions are as follows:

1. Can my previous employer contact my current employer, and if so, what can they legally tell my current employer? What would they even say? (Note: I have never gave permission to my previous employer to contact my current employer, and my current employer reached out to my previous employer when performing a background check before I was hired. I don’t believe they ever successfully contacted my previous employer.)
2. If my previous employer contacts their lawyers, what would likely happen? How, if at all, could they force me to return the $6,200 immediately given that my employment agreement does not specify a date at which this money must be returned?

* Would a lawyer even take this case (I don’t think the company retains legal counsel)

3. Could I theoretically never payback the $6,200 without punishment given the agreement language?

4. What would you do?

One of my buddies is a business transactions lawyer, and he thinks the threat to contact my current employer is hot air, stating it would give me the opportunity to pursue a defamation / libel lawsuit. That being said, our leadership team is from India and may not be aware of these laws. Moreover, I’m pretty sure they write all employee contracts without legal review, which explains why there is no payback date in my employment agreement. 

Any advice is appreciated. I worked my ass off at this company and know firsthand how dishonest the leadership team is, so I’d like to fight it as much as I could without putting myself at serious risk.

 Employees : 50-60

Problem:  Our organization declared this month that we will be having salary cuts  around 30-40% each month for everyone next few months. (No commitment  to payback the cuts later once all is good)

What seemed fishy about this is -

1)They wont officially announce it(no notice / Circular or email)  the only way they have communicated it to us is via a zoom call.

2)work loads have spiked more than ever and a few new projects too.. none of  the old clients  shut down as we keep getting work from those clients.  (Which our organization vaguely says have shutdown)

3)most of us are asked to work weekends without any compensatory Off  
Which was never the case before in past few months.

So  if you they ample work  for employees Why would they be cutting  salaries and not announce it officially,   
are they just capitalizing this situation?   
are they exploiting us.?

Anyway, after paying her the 400 rs, she told she was going to get ready for the session. After no reply for about 10 mins, i went to her profile, and I couldn't follow her. I realised she had blocked me and I had been scammed.

There         is some ethical guidance that you should not discriminate the         administration of life saving treatment based on age, in fact even   some       legal protection against this.

As per Terms of Use, the governing law is of the Netherlands. Is there any legal precedent that can support a refund request for the extra cost? A precedent from US law can also work I guess. 

My point is that I always used the content available for Netflix India which had a cheaper rate, and since my account showed a $16 rate, I always thought that is the monthly billing rate and didn't know about regional variation.
