I was coming home from a wedding in my friend's car with 3 other people's. We stopped briefly at a shop to buy something.

While one of my friend went out to buy it, a poor person with a very young daughter came to the driver and asked if he can drop him to x location.

With no intention of giving him a ride regardless, the driver quoted him a high amount. So the guy respectfully said he is poor and can't afford this much. At this point, driver started abusing this person, insulting him for being poor, and continued screaming even after he left.

And worst part was I just sat there without interrupting him. I could have stopped the driver. But I felt scared of the driver and didn't utter a word.

I feel sad for this person. Just because you are poor doesn't mean you have to take shit from other people's.

I was always badly scolded whenever I mentioned of my male friends during my Engineering days to them. They said that we will stop your education. My parents were in an unhappy marriage. My father was pretty much absent during my childhood as he always took job postings intentionally away from home. My mother took care of us then and she was  emotionally abusive towards me and my brother. When I turned 18, behaviour of my father changed and he started getting involved in the family maybe after realising that he will not stay young forever and will need family’s help. 
My parents are very overprotective. I feel my father is a little sexist and usually compliments my brother more while discrediting my achievements as pure luck.

My best friend 24F lets call her Paige, has been through the absolute ringer! She's had the worst, the absolute worst relationship luck.

He ended up in jail (yaaas) 
Now Paige like almost all of the ladies in NZ are absolutely obsessed, head over heels in love with Indian culture. Like would become indian if they could. 
Relationship number 2. Paige meets an indian man Raj and they have a shotgun wedding at a registry office. Raj decided to leave the country and go back to India and used the excuse of his dad was sick and wasn't coming home for just in case reasons until he dies. This was back in 2016. His dad is still alive and he has not returned to New Zealand once!!!?!?!?! Paige is in the midst of a divorce at the moment. 
Indian boyfriend number 2: Paige gets pregnant to Indian man, man leaves her when she admits to being pregnant. She has child. Beautiful little bouncing baby boy! 
Here we go again. Paige has found herself an absolute arsehat. Indian, claims he has floods of money but doesn't pay his way, makes her do everything for him. He is extremely physically rough with paiges child 
She has called me on multiple occasions saying that he's been physically abusive with her. I am so sick of the shit she comes out with because just the other day what do you know, you guessed it SHE'S ENGAGED AGAIN?!?!?!?!?!
This is the same girl who told me the other day she cheated on him because she thinks she might not love him.

There has always been some problems with them, and I’ve tried to make my boyfriend understand that family is not supposed to treat members like that. Few weeks ago things escalated, with his mom, dad and sister all shouting at him about how horrible he is, his mom going as far as saying that he is dead to her and he’s never welcome back to India. They also accused me of white washing him and manipulating him, as his big crime that cause all of this fighting was him wanting his own future, instead of sending all his money to his parents, and he doesn’t want his parents living with him. After this he finally understood that their constant accusations and manipulation are mental abuse. The next day he however called them again, and after some more arguing and tantrums, things seem to calm down, his family promised to stop pressuring him so much and his mom brushed off everything that was said with “I was angry, I didn’t mean it.” To me this is absolute bullshit, if my family ever treated me like that, they wouldn’t be my family anymore, a grown up is responsible for what they say even when they’re angry. 
Now my boyfriend wants me to give them a chance, meet them and forget all about this. 
How can I forget how they treat him, and how can I forget what they’ve accused me of, turning me into the evil person that has taken their son away from them. 
My boyfriend says that if this happens ever again, he’ll cut ties with them. I find that hard to believe as he makes excuses of their behavior like “my mom didn’t mean it, she was just really angry”, or “they have nothing against you, they’re just going thoughts financially though times.”

4,23,My (20F) boyfriends (23M) ex (22?F) has been harassing for 2 years and threatend to kill me,1.0,etaoug,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/etaoug/my_20f_boyfriends_23m_ex_22f_has_been_harassing/,1.0,1579902836.0,"ThrowRA because I don't want her to come after me on here too. I'm unsure of how old she is but I believe she is 22. 

So, this all started in 2017. My boyfriend and I had been dating for about half a year and were and still aren't very public about our relationship. Back then, we had 0 pictures together or commenting on each others posts, only on Facebook we were 'in a relationship'. To give you some background, my boyfriend and I live in the Netherlands whereas she lives in Spain. She is originally Indian and lived in England for a while whilst he is English and lived in Spain for a while. It is confusing. I'm unsure of the specifics of their relationship, I know they dated for roughly 2 years and they did long distance mostly. It was approximately from 2013 until 2015. It ended (according to him) because he found out she had cheated on him; however, he still had a trip planned to India to visit her so he went anyway and didn't break it off until after. In India, according to my boyfriend, she was some type of celebrity. Basically her parents were part of the 1% rich people and she was a 'socialite' with fans and a big IG following and all that.

It all started with pretty childish stuff, nothing serious. She would make Snapchat accounts and add me and be a dick to me, call me ugly etc. I blocked them and moved on. Then, she moved to Instagram where she did the same thing, once again I blocked the accounts and put my own account private. The messages got worse and worse, including accusations about my boyfriend cheating, screenshots of old conversations between him and girls, all sorts. My boyfriend Facebook messaged her to ask her to stop and she would 'pretend' not to know of anything, she sent a voice message cursing us out saying she doesn't have time to alledgedly harass me. She blamed it on one of her 'fans' from back in the day who are obsessed with her. However, I didn't believe this because she seemed way too pissed off about the accusation, didn't try to help us, plus the details she came out with in the messages were private things between my boyfriend and her, and included screenshots. She always had two different tones in the messages: 1) hating on me, saying they would always get back together 2) sending screenshots and trying to get me to leave him.

This continued for months and I'm not going to bore you with the contents, however the most concerning part was that she would always have private conversations off his phone, mostly Facebook. He has changed his password multiple times and checked his activity and nothing works. Its like she knows how to hack into stuff. This then led to my boyfriend deleting all his social media, apart from Facebook messenger so he could talk to people. His e-mail adress was hacked from 17 countries at once, and she kept pulling out old screenshots from his old accounts that she somehow got in to. 

If the hacking wasn't serious enough, in May I went abroad for half a year and she found out I was alone and (maybe coincedentally) booked a trip to the city I was staying in. I found out because her 'fake account' messaged me saying I can't wait to run into you and kill you. Since this message, my boyfriend and I have been paranoid that she will come to our country and harm me.

We finally had a bit of radio silence from August-December until she suddenly messaged him on Facebook, off of her real account. She sent a whole paragraph about how she was thinking of him and learnt so much from him, memories flooded back into her head and she just wanted to tell him how grateful she was of her time with him. He replied something like he knew it was her and that he doesn't understand the motives. She insisted again it wasn't her and her life is fucked up too and she's truly sorry for the pain those must have caused. He blocked her. 

Now, obviously we have filed a police report but sadly they can't do much as she does not live in the same country. We are clueless as to what to do, the messages are quite simple because we just block them but the threats are serious. How can we make it clear to her to stop or try to understand what she is trying to gain?

TL;DR My boyfriends ex girlfriend who lives in a different country has been sending me abusive messages that include screenshots off of his phone for years. She insists it isn't her but one of her crazy fans (she is a 'celebrity'). He has changed his password numerous times but to no avail. Then she threatend to kill me if she saw me. What can we do?

Didn't think I would be writing this out but I don't know where to go anymore.

Let me start by saying I have been Married for 2 years now and we celebrated our 2nd anniversary on the 20th of January. We've been together for 4 years. We live in a decent home with my parents. We're Indian so this is quite a common practise, we have had our ups and downs over this period but it has never gotten this bad. I love my wife and have tried my level best to keep her as happy and content as possible.

There has been an ongoing source of discomfort for quite sometime which is the fact that my Father had come into some financial trouble few years back. The reason for this is various factors such as helping his Parents who fell ill & a younger brother (my uncle) & his family, he never seemed to hold a stable job and frankly I believe has some psychological issues. I lost my job a few years ago and was unable to find a stable one for 2 years. My Mom who was also employed with a company for 20 years was forced to leave her job because she wasn't being paid and hasn't been given her end of service benefits which stack up to be a substantial amount.

I managed to get him on a payment plan to pay off all his debt a year and a half ago. He's already cleared out a major chunk of it, I take care of all the expenses as I have a decent job now. Leaving him to only pay off his debt. I got married and my wife had to move where I am as I was supporting my family, she's quite educated and smart and I thought she would find a job very quickly. Unfortunately life has been a bitch and she didn't find anything good enough for the whole time she's been here.

All the love I have for her means nothing only and only because I choose to support my father in paying off the debt.

I've had to endure huge amount of abuse verbally, psychologically & sometimes physically (can't believe I'm saying this) over the whole time we've been together. She has a huge temper and most of the time there is no reason for it, I have learned over the years and try to avoid topics where I know it's gonna end up with her shouting at me but it still happens as I can't control external factors, somehow that is my fault too. She's banged her head against cupboard doors and thrown things at me in fits of rage. We haven't had sex for more than six months now, she yelled at me while we used to have sex and try to control how it all went which was a huge turn off for me. I stopped expecting it altogether, we do pleasure each other orally but that has stopped for the past month too. She also finds the negative aspect in everything and never tries to look on the bright side despite my several attempts to try and ask her to do so.

She keeps saying that she wants to have a child. I told her to wait a while when we got married so that we could build a strong bond, an underatanding and be good parents. I also wanted to help my father a little while as well because if I left them they wouldn't be able to manage it all alone and the country where I live would most likely end up in Jail. I don't see that bond and respect, I fear bringing a child into this would be a bad idea.

I get treated like shit for doing this on a daily basis now and it's reached a point where I don't feel like going home. I'm writing this in out on a bench at 12 in the night. She's found a job that she likes now & I thought things would change as she would have a purpose again, unfortunately she's done nothing but complain since she's joined.

We've had some amazing times together and we went on a trip past October to celebrate her birthday. We went to all the places she liked and I was hoping to rekindle the love which did happen to a certain level but was short lived as she refused to come back after the trip citing the financial condition of my family. In this time my dad fell ill because of the stress and I had to send him back to India to get treated. I ended paying for their tickets and some of the treatement. She decided to come back after a lot of convincing, she wanted to work India for which I was also ready as I just wanted her to be happy.

I've made some of the best memories of my life with her but now we Can't seem to even talk to each other. What she wants seems to keep changing as I try and keep resolving each problem. Finally now the problem is with me I don't know how to change that.

I'm sure I have my faults and am not easy to live with sometimes but does that justify being treated like this?

I know I can't put in all the details here and there are major parts left out but I'm desperate now & don't know how to handle the situation. She keeps bringing up Divorce and keeps crying.

She's not giving me a divorce though but keeps threatening it. She used to talk to her ex despite me & her friends telling her how it was a bad idea and keeps telling me how much better he was compared to me. It hurts

I can share more if you would like to know, but all I'm asking for is to know whether I should be treated like this and how I should handle the situation

6,43,The Life changing dilemma: Should I tell my parents or not?,1.0,ag8ke1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ag8ke1/the_life_changing_dilemma_should_i_tell_my/,21.0,1547588234.0,"I hope i am following the rules of this sub-reddit and i would like to apologies for this long post. 

Not sure if i am asking in the right sub-reddit, but here goes nothing:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A little Back story: 

&#x200B;

My(M23) Sister(F18) has been in a long distance relationship for almost like 3 1/2 years with her BF(M18+-) in Egypt. She met him in an MMORPG and had been in the same guild and stuff. In the recent years, she had been suffering from sever depression and was performing self harm and now she has been taken medicine to deal with it. I think she is performing self harm to cope with her relationship, cause she had never done that before.  She lives with my mother and my other 2 brothers in the UK and I am living with my dad in Germany (I will explain why it matters later).

&#x200B;

The Situation:

 

Last weekend my sister told the family she was going to Spain with here friend on holiday. You see, my parents are from South India, which means that they are extremely overprotective with my sister. Another reason is that the public image will get destroyed, because if a girl goes to a foreign country alone (without any family as a guardian), it is likely that she can get violated and abused (my dads perspective of the situation and I respect that, since there has been lots of ""abuse"" happening lately). My dad things that My sisters friend might bring some boys around and ""Have some fun"", which you know how it could end, and my dad doesn't what that to happen. So he asked my sister to give him the details of her friend (like phone number, address, parents contact), so he can be more assured and more confident once he knew what the friends Parent would think of this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My sister act hesitant and I did not know why. So I was thinking of helping her out (because I am her brother and she was struggling), and told her the best moves she can play to convince my dad so she can go on holiday. The next thing she told me shocked me and I don't know how to react on it:

&#x200B;

""I am not going to Spain. I am going to Egypt to see my Boyfriend. I said that so the will let me go. Don't tell Dad.""

&#x200B;

You see, my parents don't know she has a Boyfriend and us siblings are culprits of this so called crime (from the perspective of my parents). That's why she is lying all the way through. Also her actions will affect us Siblings (because our parents will pressure us to be well informed about our sister). I don't think my parents they will be happy to hear that she is having a long distance relationship with an Egyptian dude. 

&#x200B;

She is going to see him in End of march, she has booked everything and is ready. I tried to talk her out of it, and explained how important it is to be honest with this kind of matters (imo, love, romantic or not, is a very delicate/sacred thing, and honesty is very important here. There are enough people who dislike the idea of it because people like my sister pulling off this kind of show) and she said:

&#x200B;

""I am not happy with my current life, I am tired of it, and it will give me hope if I meet him. I will let mum and dad no after I come back"".

&#x200B;

Then shortly, her BF messaged me that there is no concern for me because he will ""protect her"", and he will even ""take a bullet for her"". An attempt to convince me, but I have no form of authority to decide if she can go or not.

&#x200B;

I am a pessimist. I tend to see the risks more than others. I am able to critically think and simulate scenarios using previous experiences and peoples opinion (the better I know them, the accurate the scenario becomes). So I know how stuff will end up in the end. (at least 80% of the time).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The Dilemma:

&#x200B;

1. I don't tell my parents

&#x200B;

What will happen is that my sister will go without letting anyone know to Egypt. My parents will get worried and squeeze us(my 2 brothers and me) for info and howl us out to search for her. She can either be safe with her boyfriend (my guts is telling me something else), or he ""misuse"" and she comes back with a shame to her family (unfortunately losing virginity, especially to a girl, is not taken lightly in our culture), or even gets killed (its a different country, so it is more likely to happen, since she is a foreigner and no one cares). In that case, I would not be able to life with myself, since I knew what she is going to do and I didn't do anything to stop.

&#x200B;

2. I tell my parents:

&#x200B;

If I tell my parents, that will put my sister in the bad light instantly and I get some of the damage too since I am a culprit (which I am ready to take). I will be the one among my siblings to sabotage my sisters relationship (since my parents will most likely to cut all kind of connections, so she can't contact him any more). She might get a hell of a scolding and she be watched more closely than ever before. Most likely she will lose the access to the Internet because of that. Since she has sever depression and she tried to ""take her life"" once (Paracetamol overdose). She might attempt to ""take her life"" again. Since me and my dad are in a different country, its hard to deal with this issue when the problem arises. I don't want to lose my sister.

&#x200B;

I have a saying that ""You should not snitch out of our generations"". Like if we do something bad, we make sure we clean it up so my parents (or other people outside our generation) won't notice anything. Basically cover up each other asses (I know its sound stupid, but that how we get a little bit of more than we are allowed to do). The point is I will break my word and my other siblings will see me differently. This is because if I do it once, what will stop me to do it again (turning a back on a sibling). They will close me out and it will be harder to ask them for info. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Current Opinion:

&#x200B;

I am not sure which one is the best way, but my gut is telling me that telling my Parents and turn my back on my sister on this one. This is because of some factors:

&#x200B;

1. She has not been honest by 100% to anyone. (I assume I only know 20% of what is happening with my sister)

2. I feel my parents are left out in the dark for long time and it is enough. I can't bear to see them like this, worrying about my sister. (Since they have absolute no context about the situation at all). Its their daughter, their ONLY daughter, and its an effort to give birth and raise to just be let go of. 

&#x200B;

She will never trust me ever again. (I will let my parents know that before I turn my back on her, so they don't rely on my when it comes to discussing stuff about my sister). 

I think I can live with the hope, that she understand me one day. I it will 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am kindly asking those who are very experienced in life (or those, who know better than me), to give me their point of view, so I can refine my decision.

&#x200B;

\*\*TL;DR;\*\* : In short, should I tell my parents and make sure they have a better context of the situation or not?

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance.

&#x200B;

so mom made it clear in front of her that your relationship should be just as friends don't think ahead about anything.

she understood that it was a warning for her, later when i dropped her off and came back home mom said pretty directly that you can do better. pretty forward stuff like her teeth are coming forward and i can see through her posture how her abusive family has messed up her. how we have a high status she has nothing to offer to me(us?) and shouldn't have people with abusive  and divorced parents .

&#x200B;

i didn't care about her opinion till she kept saying she was unattractive, but when she started mentioning her family i did wondered will this actually be an issue.i personally know how she is not like her family she is pretty, smart, reliable, understanding and the only person i've ever  opened up to and only female I've thought isnt annoying and for a **period of 8 months**. obviously she has some behaviour flaws like being controlling, seeks vengeance(she claims never seen it), stubborn( in a positive way too) and needs a mouth filter but man i never expect anyone to be perfect.

&#x200B;

i have avoided talking to her what my family told me later, and don't want to destroy her by telling her but not sure what do i say to her. I said ill call u in the evening tell u stuff. also a detail is that i live in india so just abandoning their opinion is a tough thing here. I will have to fight to keep her.

not sure what should i do or even tell her when i call her.. i thought i will keep the relationship ahead a secret and get serious when the time is right which just seems irresponsible.

I (M21) is in a relationship with a very smart, beautiful girl (F21). We both are from India. We really love each other very much and really see a future together. Now although we live in same city due to our daily routine and studies we don't have a lot of time to meet each other physically (Basically you can say we are in a LDR). Now the real problem is my girlfriend's over controlling mother who is really paranoid in nature and says insulting things to my girlfriend regularly which I think amounts to mental abuse. My girlfriend tolerate her without saying anything for many years (Her mother basically ruined her first love by using threat and manipulation).
    Last day in desperation my girlfriend asked me hypothetically whether I will give her place in my home if she ever get out of there. Now as I live under my parent's roof I really don't have the choice to take the decision and I said that to her.

My sister is financially dependent on her husband. Her husband verbally and physically abuse her all the time and in front of her kids. Our family is not financially well off. Both of my parents are disabled in a road accident. My sister couldn't complete her education. She was married off early and unfortunately to this terrible person. 
When I was fifteen, I was alone in the living room with my brother in law, and he touched me in my private areas and told me not to move, took off his pants, and tried to rape me. I froze, I didn't know how to react. But gathering all the power in my body, I ran away and locked myself in my bed room. I was so shocked and ashamed. The very next day I met him in the garage of our house, I was so scared.. and he acted like absolutely normal in front of my mother and sister. I was in agony for days. I was abused but i'll be able to forget that one day, but what about her? She has to stick with this person for her entire life. 
After a few months, I told everything to my mother, because I couldn't bear keeping this burden. My mother did what she could, she accused my sister's husband. My sister asked me is it true, I said yes. My sister had a massive fight with her husband because of that but she didn't had the courage to ask for divorce because she had two children, no job, no education. 
He is a police officer and he'll be able to keep the childrens to himself, We live in India, here anything is possible for people who hold the power like police officer, political members or any ridiculously rich man. And here if you are broke or have no financial support then government is not going to help you either. If you report against a police officer, no one will listen to you. You can't even get a job if you have a long employment gap. So thinking everything carefully she choose to stay after her husband apologised. But he continued to verbally and physically abuse my sister after a few months. 
I saw a lot, so I studied really hard throughout my life, I got scholarship so I continued my studies. I Studied like a desperate creature on the verge of loosing it's everything. I recently got scholarship in engineering and student visa in Australia ( University of technology, Sydney) and leaving this country 25th February. So i have very few days to spend here. 
But my brother in law, called me suddenly and name calling me without any reason, out of nowhere. He said something like, even if I achieved alot in my life, I'll be as miserable as I was when he tried to rape me.. Oh my, he cursed me and what not. He cursed my family, and told me he'll get divorce soon and leave my sister alone, distance her from the kids. I can't believe his guy. I'm not even going to tell it to anyone, my parents are old and sick, the only happiness I was able to bring them, is my achievements and they are so happy and I can't take away all that from them just like that. How will they be able to bear this pain, that one of their daughter is fulfilling her dreams and the other one is dying slowly everyday. 
Sorry, I'm it's just frustrating. F*ck him.

Tips and tricks welcomed to remain grounded.,2.0,ampu5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ampu5e/is_he_pulling_awayif_so_how_should_i_respond_tips/,0.0,1549231702.0,"How does one (meaning me) find balance between both their feminine and masculine energies? To know when to take ""initiative"" and when to lean back and wait for responses/ actions from a man? I know men are different and not all are the same or respond in the same manner.

Right off the back, I am a rather introverted/shy individual and currently in the process of returning to the strong woman I know I am/was (after exiting a somewhat toxic relationship). Since I started getting back into the dating game, I find myself sometimes overthinking situations, overanalysing actions or responses  and it can wear a highly sensitive soul out! How can I let go completely and enjoy the experiences for what it is and allow them to naturally fold?

Some of them-, my shadows I mean.. were of course brought about during my childhood as a means of survival. Grew up in a household with an abusive Narc parent...you get the gist of it. I am doing the work to release those learned patterns and habits to appease others in fear of rejection, etc. But I find myself in situations can be either romantic or platonic where I become anxious.

Case in point... I am currently in a situation with a friend whom I've known for a number of years, and we've recently decided to explore the romantic feelings we've always had for one another but kept from one another. Call it bad timing, missed connection (him traveling the world, starting relationships with other people, me reconnecting with an ex and eventually becoming a mom, whatever).  This past summer we connected again...

Unfortunately 2-3 months into us ""dating"" and were just recently intimate, he had plans to travel abroad (he does this annually during the winter months) and will return in April. We hadn't really decided anything regarding our situation/relationship as we are open to the situation as it is new to the both of us but we at least wanted to keep the momentum going.

Since he's been on his trip, he has been interested in keeping the communication going, sending me updates w/ what he's up to (sending me pictures/video clips), etc. He even surprised me a week or two ago by serenading me with a song ( he even went so far to start taking lessons by one of the locals there and had been practicing everyday since he arrived there) during our first video chat since his arrival. It was really sweet of him. However, this past week and a half I've somewhat pulled away and haven't initiated contact or anything with him. I'm not feeling very well emotionally since the winters here are pretty harsh and its usually this time of year that I start experiencing a bit of depression/anxiety bouts ( I'll always be a California girl). Drawing inward has nothing to do with him or whatever, as it usually happens in other social aspects of my life and I turn to concentrating on work/meditation-yoga/self-care to get me through. In addition to the weather, I had found out that a promotion that I was promised and literally waiting on for the last four months felt through. So I've been pretty down.  Last week he must have felt that ( he knows about me and my depression/anxiety as it usually kicks in a bit more this time of year) and sent me a quick sound clip of the sounds you could hear from his house (since he's living basically in a tropical/jungle environment, you could hear the distant sounds of nature and soft local music being played in the background). Very beautiful stuff..and went on to say that he just wanted to say hi, that he hopes that all is well and that he sends his love. From the sound of his voice he really sounded like he missed me.

&#x200B;

I responded in my usual sarcastic way : ""Hey!Thank you for the symphony... A shift from the hustle and bustle of the city. Where the only soundtrack here is the “lovely” sounds of traffic, car horns, shouting, and god knows what else.Things here on my end have been a bit stressful, somewhat disappointing but there’s not much too it but to keep pushing foreword and just keep it movin’.How have you been? Any more development on the houses in #### / or the trip to India you mentioned earlier? Hope you’ve been feeling better...But yes, moving towards lighter times. It’s no longer pitch black during the commute home. ;) <3"".

&#x200B;

That was on Jan 23rd and I haven't heard anything from him since then.

I use FB sometimes for work and we've probably seen each other being logged in and active (adding people/rsvping to events there, etc)...but he hasn't reached out since then. Was he perhaps mirroring my behaviour? We have grown comfortable with each other sharing our emotions/thoughts even when we are experiencing bad days, weeks, whatever. So I didn't think it was.

Checked in with him on Thursday. He read both messages but hasn’t responded. I've been keeping busy with work/life, my own stuff...so I don't overanalyse the situation. We're somewhat the same personality wise, so giving each other space or needing it is no problem.  But I’m wondering what’s going on as he has never been like this, where he has read my messages but literally doesn't respond to them in two weeks.

&#x200B;

I know that it's somewhat hard to keep a momentum going whilst the other person is away for a prolonged period (3-4 months). We were under some sort of understanding that we would stay open to each other. And I thought the fact that we have been friends for a number of years now that we would be able to communicate.  Then he messages me, does romantic gestures and even starts making plans for us to do together when he comes back in April.

I
liked her a lot, she had a unique
personality and was amazing. We were
together for just 3 months before I had
to end it. I am Indian so I had pressure
from my mom to kinda settle down and
marry. However, I had just started
dating my ex and while she was the
best thing that had happened to me as
a gf she wasn't wife material. My mom
also didn't like her when she saw a pic
of her. The thing is my ex has been
brought up abroad and I was brought
up in India so there were some culural
differences. So I figured it wasn't the
risk being with someone although there
was never any problems between us. I
figured the rapport between her and my
mom would not be good. I just figured it
would be easier to end it then rather
than end it later because I would be
more emotionally attached to her. She
just wasn't marriage material and I was
looking for a wife. When I had started
dating her I thought I would be able to
look past her not being Indian enough
or not being tall enough (she was 5ft
and I was 5ft 10) but I just couldn't. I
wasn't sure she was the one and I had
dated her for 3 months. She just didn't
meet my wife requirements.
She had let go of me several times
during the relationship and told me if
this marriage thing was going to be a
problem and she knew my mom had a
problem with her let's end it. But at the
time I always assured her what
mattered the most was that I wanted to
be with her and that is what mattered.
But ultimately I guess I broke her heart
for the same reason she was worried
about.
I broke up in Dec and throughout the
whole time she would message me
every couple of days to say let's be
friends or lets get back together. I had
not known that what she was going
through behind the screen because she
wanted me back not because she was
going through the pregnancy but
because I wanted to be with her. But
tbh once I made my decision I moved
on pretty fast and I realized I just wasn't
attracted to her anymore. I figured she
was lying and just was in disbelief,
because we never had sex, maybe my
tip went in, but never full penetration.
So when we both came back from
vacation, I realized that she really was
pregnant. She still didn't tell me the
whole story but was visibly in pain. But I
thought okay the miscarriage
happened. Told her to forget it
happened because to be honest it
never was meant to happen not like we
were trying for the baby. She is like can
you be there for me because I get
anxious and would just like some
support. Tbh I just didn't want to be
there for her. I didn't get why she
couldn't move on and just forget it (at
this point I thought she had a
miscarriage). I told her not like the baby
had a heartbeat and to just move on.
To push her away I was mean to her on
purpose. I told her to her face she
wasn't tall enough, I wasn't attracted to
her anymore, I don't care what happens
to her, she wasn't wife material. She
became an emotional mess, was going
to therapy, and would still talk with me
every once and then. Because she
couldn't sleep once it became dark and
was anxious most of the time.
In between I did get back with her, but
then I just couldn't. I switched my mind
about 5 times in a week about getting
back with her. My ex called this
emotionally abusive. I don't think it was
emotionally abusive. I just didn't want to
be with her, if I did it would be forcing
myself.
She had fainted once I took her to the
ER because she called me up. She
held my hand, and I just pulled my
hands away. I told her the nurse was
hot. I just wanted to walk away from all
the drama and the mess. I mean why
should I be with her in any way? Even
as a friend?
She explained she felt safe when I was
there but anxious and maybe
depressed when she was alone or even
with friends. I get it, she is a masters
student who is pregnant. But what can I
do?
I know I am responsible but whatever
happened happened right. She should
just get over it. She told me she never
got a sincere apology. But I don't think I
am wrong here at all. I don't want to be
with her. And I don't see any way I can
help her.
So after I found out she is still pregnant,
for a week she has been strong and not
talking to me much. She told me she
doesn't associate the baby with me.
She would never want the baby to have
a father like me and it would never
come to bite me in the ass because she
didn't even want the baby to be 1% like
me. She told me that I was cheap and I
used her. She is saying I used her
because during our whole relationship
she had wanted to take things
physically slow but the way I knew how
to show affection was through physical
means, so I may have pushed it in
some ways. Well she enjoyed it so I
didn't think I was wrong. She told me
know that once the physical things had
consequences my reaction was to look
for an escape route. Well I keep telling
her I don't want to be with her. We have
broken up so why would I get back with
her and I want to stick with my decision
to stay broken up. I want to look for a
wife not someone to date. She told me
just like that she doesn't want me to be
part of or have any knowledge on her
life and what she is doing witht the

12,65,I'm (28/M) finding it incredibly hard to put up with my Dad's (55/M) hypocrisy and lack of foresight,2.0,5ts6iq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5ts6iq/im_28m_finding_it_incredibly_hard_to_put_up_with/,4.0,1487010484.0,"I'm from a traditional Indian family living with my parents and I work with my dad in our family business. We live in a small town in South India and hence the culture is conservative and family oriented.

I've been working with my Dad for 3 years since I finished my studies in Europe and I feel completely demoralised without having made any progress personally or professionally. He never lets me make any decisions and almost always shuts me up when I try to talk in a meeting with our office staff. I've tried my best to get involved with the business but its always a case of 1 step forward and 2 back. The business isn't going great because of our financial issues which we have been trying to face for the past 7 years. He doesn't give me the freedom because he feels I may not make the right decision which may lead to further losses. 

Always get agitated when I ask him about work related issues and hence I've stopped asking him. 

Always shuts me up when I try to sit down and discuss about our financial issues and how we can plan our commitments. 

Never sat down with him to talk business. Always deals with everything in a authoritative manner and he can never be questioned and he can never be wrong. 

He'll twist facts and he'll remind you of your wrong doings a 100 times if he has to, to vindicate himself. 

The culture and way of working in the company is at least a decade behind and its mainly down to him and lack of cash in the company. 

He never trusts me with even a 100 bucks. Everything goes through him. 

Worst part he carries this baggage home.

Emotionally puts all this baggage on my mother. 

He thinks I shouldnt be out drinking with friends  because of how bad the company is doing and the state of our finances. I go out once a week on a Saturday after Monday - Friday (10.00am - 7pm) and Sat (9.30 - 2pm) of work. 

The main reason we are in this shit hole is because of his drinking habits which was much worse and led to huge losses in the business. 
He binge drinks on Sat night, Sunday afternoon and Sunday night and bitches about all our problems and me to my Mom and brother. He drives under the influence and expects me and my friends to be perfect (i've stopped driving under the influence). 

Off late hes been very abusive when he gets drunk. He calls me when I'm with my friends and abuses me. He blames all the shit thats happening on me. He's always found a reason to deflect. 

He lives to appease people in this small town of ours. He lives under an illusion that we are important people and hence we need to live in a certain way. I sincerely feel something needs to give. The company and our family will be in a much worse financial situation if this continues. I can see that happening.  

I really want to make this work and help my family to move on from these issues we are facing. But I feel like i'm not growing as a person and want to leave and make it on my own. But I'm scared because I don't know where to start. I also feel like I will be running away from my problems. 

tl;dr Dad doesnt give me freedom to operate in business but blames all the problems on me. Getting abusive off late when he gets drunk and blames all issues on me. I dont know if I should stay or move on.

Anyhow, my husband came into the picture, he met her, hanged out with her and me twice may be, and since then hes been asking her to give her a massage. He has studied ayurvedic massage in India years ago, I have received one massage from him, and he has given some to his aunt and his mother, and may be some other people but not often. long story short, just a couple of months ago we decided to be in an open relationship, which is fine, when he got here he told me that he really missed me and he feels that the relationship is not going well and that he feels that an open relationship is not the best option at the moment, I said ok. Therefore I didn't try or allowed anyone to get close to me in a sexual manner etc.  
On valentines day I had a ton of work, and he has 100% free time here, so does my friend as she is an artist, so he offered her the massage, she thought we both were going to her house, I didn't know until I read his facebook and noticed he was going to my friends house, which at first it made me feel weird but then I said ok, no problem, I went to grab his backpack as I needed something from there before he left, so opened the backpack and found a bottle of wine, I asked him, what is going on, and even before he met her, I asked him, when agreeing on the open relationship matter to not do anything with any of my friends, but find woman on his own.  Anyways, when I told him if he was trying to do something with her, and to please don't try anything at all, he said ""Oh that's not what open relationships are about and you are not letting me be free"" [ now lets go back to what he said when he just arrived here, he said I missed you I don't think its good to have an open relationship when we have problems"" therefore we are monogamous] I said ok, I wanted to go with him he said what are you going to do there for 45 minutes that the massage lasts? I said ok you are right I'm staying, ,he was supposed to give her the massage and then go pick up his bike at a place he left it the night before, he went there may be around 7-8 pm to her house,  it was 10pm at night I got worried, texted him no response, then he responded a bit, then I will text no response for a long time, I texted my friend didn't respond right away but then she did, she told me she will tell him, he never texted me, but then later on he did, I asked him to bring me back my phone which I needed, he said he was coming home soon then I said ok don't worry about the phone, he didn't come home until 4:30am. I get mad, and sad at the same time, as is valentines day, he asked me during the day if I had any plans I said no, I had to work, but I thought, man we been in this marriage for 11+ years, wouldn't he do something nice? I have done nice things for him on his birthday and valentines as surprise, I thought may be he has something planned, 11 years don't go in vain, we are not perfect but come one, we love each other right?, so I thought. He comes home I get mad, ask him what happened why he stayed so  long, his response ""why not"" walked away saying I'm jealous and blowing things out of proportion, next day, I don't talk to him I go to my friends house, I didn't say a thing, then she tells me what happened, how he gave her a massage, so she did, he made her get completely naked, and whatnot, they drank got drunk he started to caress her so she did, she thought, may be that I was ok with it but then he started to get horny and she didn't feel comfortable, she didn't know how to make him leave, he wouldn't, he kept touching her, then all that happened, she said when I texted him he didn't respond to me and just showed her my messages saying how I can do that to him and be that way, I didn't say anything wrong at all just bring my phone back please.  I said I'm getting divorced because we agreed on something, and you are disrespecting me, by not following on what we agreed upon, he keesp saying I'm taking it too far and that he didn't do anything wrong and that they both enjoyed whatever they did, I keep asking him why he did it, he said that there is nothing wrong with touching. now we do have rules with each other, if there is someone he doesn't want me to talk to I agree and so he usually does, or if he tells me don't get with this guy I don't, and I asked him the same thing to not do anything at all with any of my friends, but he did it anyways and now he says I'm being abusive and crazy and making things up that I need to change, all I want is an apology and for him to understand his mistake, but he wont understand, I really need some advice here, please!

My grandma was very old and a bit senile. She is a particularly mean and cruel woman and almost everyone she knew hated her (especially her daughter-in-laws). My mother also had a fairly strong dislike toward my grandma but didn't really try to stop my dad from bringing her too much. Even though she had a pretty mean spirited demeanor, my dad still loved her and brought her over to fulfill a promise he made when he was younger to take care of her in old age.
Now as time went on, my grandmother started to become very psychologically disturbed. She was losing her memory already but also developed intense paranoia. She would wake up in the middle of the night crying and yelling that someone was out to get her and became suspicious of everyone. If you went against her or argued with her (which my mother frequently did) she would scream at them and use some of the most vulgar, fucked up, and horrible language I had ever seen. In addition to this, her bowel control started to worsen so she would sometimes defecate or piss randomly at any place, any time. These behaviors became very intolerable for my mom who would then scold and argue with my grandma. My dad would usually join in and take my grandma's side. The fights would get pretty bad and I basically tried to stay out of the house as much as possible just to avoid the hours of screaming and shouting while my parent's marriage shattered. I soon confronted both of them and especially my dad as he would also join in on cursing at my mom with my grandma (Prior to this, he always had a bit of a hot temper but he never said anything this bad. And he always came off as a good guy among our family friends and even in my mind. I never thought I would hear this come from his mouth).
As time went on, my grandma's mind deteriorated further as she would frequently spend time home all alone for most of the day as my parents and I were out working (I'm an only child btw). She would stay at home doing literally nothing and/or sleeping. My dad got her to stop drinking milk so the random defections decreased drastically but it was still pretty hostile between my mom and her. My grandma would frequently go off and start cursing at my mom for almost anything. Granted at this point, my mom would usually use a pretty harsh tone when talking to her at all times. My mom started to give her less food and justified it by saying that my grandma can't digest half the food she makes and she doesn't know when to stop eating (At this time, my grandma would sometimes forget that she just ate 5 minutes ago and started asking for more food aka she didn't really ever feel full). This was a point of further contention between my parents as my dad thought my mom was being unfair to my grandma. My mom would frequently refer to the past when she used to live at my grandma's after marriage in India. During this time, my mom says my grandma was very harsh towards her, would barely feed her, and would favor my cousins over me. Sometimes, I think my mom is exacting revenge in the present time for things that happen in the past.
Today, my dad confided to me that he was thinking of separating from my mom and moving into an apartment for just him and his grandma. My dad further told me that he really doesn't even love my grandma like that, he is only taking care of her because it is is duty/familial obligation (This really fucking broke my heart). During this whole time, my dad would argue with my grandma a lot due to her paranoia, stubbornness, and just general mean behavior. He has brothers but all of them refuse to take her in. My parents have had a tumultuous relationship for most of their marriage but for years prior to my grandma coming, the relationship was going pretty well. They almost never argued and were bonding way more than I had seen years earlier. My mom currently doesn't drive so she is very dependent on my dad to go to work, run errands, etc... Divorce is a very taboo topic in Indian culture so this is a pretty big deal. I obviously would be absolutely heart broken if this happened and was wondering if any of you could please give advice on this situation.
tl;dr: Dad brings mean, slightly crazy grandma from India to live with the family in America. Grandma becomes psychotic as time passes on and loses bowel control. Mom hates grandma's guts due to past abuse by my grandma and her current psychotic tendencies. Mom starts to abuse grandma. Dad mostly takes side of grandma. Shit tons of arguing between dad, mom, and grandma. My dad tells me that he is thinking of separating from my mom after 40+ years of marriage. Family/domestic life is basically sucking shit for everyone in the family.",2015.0,1.0,21.0,07:01:10,abuse

I'm [17/M]. There's a girl [16] I've had a crush on for quite some time now. We talk. A lot. We're in different cities but she's been my friend since childhood. She knows that I've got a GIGANTIC crush on her. She's really sweet too. She's got a lot of emotional baggage. She gets abused a little at home. I'm the person she always talks to. It's basically like emotional counseling. She really loves me too but not the same way. She wants to try dating but not until we both finish high school so that's a years wait. 
So there was a huge fight among our friends circle yesterday cause she screwed up. I won't get into the details. Suffice it to say that I was the only one talking to her because I was only in town for my brother's engagement. So finally we were texting at night. She was really down cause she realized how much she screwed up. And because of that she was unable to see me. She asked me when I had to leave and I said 5AM. She told me to be ready at 4:15. So we both snuck out and we're able to meet each other. We talked about all the infighting and how she could fix it. Then right before leaving, she kissed me on the cheek and essentially told me she didn't want me to ever leave her. She left after that. I know a kiss on the cheek might not seem like that big a deal but I live in India and it's a huge deal. I thought I could finally move on two nights ago because she needs me as a friend more than she needs me as a boyfriend. But now this happens. If anyone has trouble understanding then think of our relationship as like that of Ted and Robin, or Ross and Rachel. Thanks for the help!

Please help.,6.0,2wsz5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2wsz5k/im_27m_trying_to_fight_for_our_relationship_but/,5.0,1424672458.0,"I’ve known S, my current girlfriend for about 7 years now. We met through a local online forum and we’ve been friends since. We met after 6 months knowing each other and since I’ve known her, I know that she is the one. I’ve been chasing her since. I’ve dated few other women but end up leaving them since the only reason I was dating them because I saw S in them.


Both of us live in an Islamic country, and she is also an Islam, although she’s not the most religious one, she has good values and good sense. She grew up on a broken family(both parents got divorced when she was young, dad got remarried as soon as he was divorced and mom got remarried recently). I on the other hand, grew up as an atheist in a dysfunctional family where I used to be abused mentally and physically by my parents and grandparents until my later years. They controlled everything about me. I had lots of savings and a bunch of properties at a very young age, although most are co-owned with my mom or dad. Parents handles my finances as well.



 When S and me got together after 5 years of chasing her, I made her very happy. I gave her every moment of my time that I can spare. I love her very much, more than life itself. She too loved me as much as I did her. I’m the only one that understands her inside out, mentally, emotionally and sexually. We build each other and supports each other very much. All our friends knows us as the power couple. I’m quite influential in what I do and she picks up very quickly too.


Last year was a disaster. I went on a family trip to India(Grandpa was from India) and right before we went, parents cracked a joke that they are going to marry me off to a village girl in India. S can be quite insecure about these things and took it seriously. We spoked about it and discussed it and I calmed her down. We did not get to talk much during the one month that I was away but I emailed her as much as I can.


Final days in India, i got into a huge fight with my parents because their idea of marrying me off turns out not being a joke. Now, not to put other people down, but I’m a guy who requires my partner as someone who’s smart and knows how to carry herself well. They were planning to marry me off to my cousin who can’t speak a word of English and can’t do anything except cooking and cleaning up the house. The fight with my parents was so fucked up that they warned me not to ask S to come to the airport to receive us or me. They did not wanted their only son, and heir to be married off to a Muslim girl and forced to convert to Islam. 


When I touched down at the airport, I met S and took her hand and left my family. They tried to slap her but I deflected that and left with her. The next day I went back home, because they called me. I told them to apologise to Shilla for the stunt they pulled in India and in the airport. They in turned kicked me out of the house. Later I found out they withdrawn all my cash and locked all my properties(close to USD1M in total, cash is around USD300k). I moved into S’s place and was going through a period of depression. I had no jobs, no house, and no money and had to depend on her to support. 


I then found out that she cheated on me, when I was in India. She went out with this useless guy and he end up getting her drunk and in her insecurity, she slept with him. When I found out about this, my heart just sank. I confronted her and she lied to me one by one bit. I told her when we started our relationship, that I require her to commit to 3 things with me. I don’t want her to lie, cheat or hide anything from me. She did all these. I finally laid out the whole story to her and when she found out I knew about everything, She admitted it. I called that motherfucker but he did not picked up the phone. I then went to his workplace and threaten him appropriately. He knew that I was serious and not to mess with me. I gave her two options, leave or stay. She chose to stay.



She then had to leave to her parent’s place and forced to take up a job there. We were then divided by this huge ocean and flights are expensive and since she works in an airline, she gets discounted ticket to come here once a month. I took a little contract work here and there. I found then she’s been talking to this guy and was trying to meet with him here while coming down to see me but I foiled that meetup before it happen, these things has a habit to just appear in front of me without me doing much investigation. I have lots of skills and these skills are not really in demand in the market but it’s one of those skills that makes a lot of money provided you found someone who wants it. after 8 months of depression addled mind and being jobless and staying home alone, I finally found one. I started to work hard and try to catch up and build myself back again. I’ve been spending the past 4 months paying off debts that I borrowed for the past 8 months. I worked so hard that sometimes I spend days in the office without going home or eat. I spoke to S once or twice a day either via text or a little 5-10minute call.



I did not knew about this, but she started talking to another guy who lives in a country just an hour flight away. I had no inkling of this because of my busy hours. He said sweet things that she wants to hear and they planned to travel together next month. Now this guy is another jerk and he is just looking to get into her pants. Last two weeks, she said she’s heading to the country that he’s in for a work trip. I told her that I will see her at the airport while she’s down here for the layover flight. I found her in this new attractive outfit, dressed to impress. I complimented it, but she looked distant. Last week she told me they her friend wants to borrow the house that I’m currently living(her house) for a weekend. I told her I’ll get a cheap hotel room nearby my office and since i’ll be spending the day working it’s non-issue at all. Last minute, I decided to use Airbnb instead, and went I tried to use her referral code for my account, I found an Airbnb booking in Taipei in her email. Curious me, did some checking and found her that she’s been talking to this guy and is planning for a trip. He even had an itinerary drawn up and the whole work. They even tried to have sex when she went to see him but he couldn’t get it up. I called her up and asked her to explain. She said she’s been talking to this guy and apologised and told me she’ll come down and explain the whole thing since we have a 4 days holiday weekend. I waited. 



The last 4 days has been emotionally, motivationally and mentally torturing. I found out that they are in love, but according to her, it’s just a matter of speech. I love her too much to physically hit her but in my head I know this is all my fault. I’ve been working too hard and ignoring her, and I know she needs my attention. I told her to break it off with him, but she told me she needs to leave, she then went to see him(flight’s an hour away) and this made me more pissed. I punched the store room door and broke it with one single punch, that was how pissed this whole thing made me. I wanted to take the next flight down but my friends told me to calm down. They know of my temper, when I’m angry I’m break down everything. I might even have killed the guy if I saw him.


She came back the next day, I brought her out on a nice date and spent the whole day and evening treating her to her favourite. She then explained that she broke it off with him and will never talk to him again, but I told her that she needs to build my trust again. He gave her a bracelet during their first meeting, and I asked her to give it back, which she claimed she did. This morning, before she left she told me that she wants a short break, to find out what’s wrong with her and what she wants in life and she wants to build herself. I told her that we can do this together, and it’s faster if you have a helping hand. She said that she wants to do it alone, and wants me to build myself too, by getting my own place being the primary thing.


I agreed with her to have a short break. Provided both of us exchange one email on the things we love and hate about each other, and our problems and how we are going to fix them. She agreed. I also told her we are not to see or talk to anyone else during this period.


I love this woman very much and I don’t think I can survive living without her.  I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing. The voices in my head is fucking shit up and I don’t have the motivation to work and even live anymore. I literally have no one in my life anymore, and I left my family for her, although I don’t regret that one single bit.


What should I do, please don’t tell me to break up with her. I need some solid advice. I can see us being happily married and I want to but I need her to build my trust back.",2015.0,2.0,23.0,12:05:58,abuse

He and my mum were broken up when she found out she was pregnant at 21 and immediately as I’m told, he asked for her to get an abortion as he never wanted kids, did not have a stable job and was very very addicted to weed and slightly to MDMA. My mom chose to keep me and decided to better her life by finishing university and getting a stable job.

My dad however took off to India and lived with monks for the majority of my mum’s pregnancy. He came back from there before I was born and decided he wanted partial custody of me. I don’t remember much of my childhood but my dad used to look after me while drunk or high the majority of time which lead to some severe emotional abuse and physical abuse towards me and my mum. My mum felt like she could not interfere out of fear of physical retaliation from my dad. 

He did not contribute at all towards my financially struggling mother and would often take off to Asia as a way in which to ween himself off drugs. After this, he would come back and be an actual supportive father but soon enough he would relapse again.

Sometime when I was about 11-14, he became addicted to meth and the threats became more violent as well as him refusing to sign a legal document that I needed in order to to change my life for the better and he was homophobic when I came out as gay.

When I was 16, I cut him out of my life and he spent a few days literally stalking me before confronting me and just about kidnapping me. I threatened to get a restraining order and felt terrified constantly until one day he dropped off the signed legal document and from what I heard left for Thailand.

I just turned 18 and my dad’s side of the family invited me to an important family party. I didn’t expect an invite as they have a history of being homophobic and after I cut ties with my dad, they took his side and tried to guilt trip me into talking to him again.

As I was walking in the door my aunt informed me that my dad was there even though they had previously told me that he was not going to be there. Somehow at the party we were left alone and he told me that he’s been off meth for a year and is regularly going to therapy to get treatment from what he now knows is borderline personality disorder. I really missed having the supportive dad that I had when he sober. How do I improve my relationship with him? I also have drug addiction issues but I’m not sure how we would both be functional and if this would cause more problems?

1,14,My [33M] wife's sister [25F] who is also the girlfriend of my brother [26M] may have cancer,3.0,akie2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/akie2q/my_33m_wifes_sister_25f_who_is_also_the/,3.0,1548668095.0,"Let me introduce the people involved:

My wife, S [30F]

My brother, M [26M]

His girlfriend, R [25F]

A little bit of background: I am an Indian doctor, working in a hospital in an urban area in India.  S and I had an arranged marriage about 6 years.  When we got married, M and R became friends and now they have been dating for 4 years.  Both of our parents know about this (they don't care that it will be a ""love marriage) and they're probably going to get married in the near future.

A couple of days ago, I saw R coming out of the oncology wing at the hospital.  I have a work friend who I eat lunch with whose office is right there next to the wing.  Now, I am not an oncologist, but sometimes I may have to see a patient if the cancer happens to be in an area of the body I specialize in.  When I saw her, I didn't want to jump to any conclusions.  She might have just been passing by or she might have had an appointment for something else.  I had to get going as I had a surgery, but I did wave to her.  Her face had a look of sadness.  She also seemed a bit startled, which was really weird.  She knows where I work.  

What really confirmed my suspicions was that on Friday, she directly came out of the oncologist's office.  I saw her talking with one of the oncologists.  She was crying.  I went up to her and asked her what happened.  She just sort of avoided eye contact, and just ran away...  I haven't said anything to my wife or my brother as of yet.  I have absolutely no idea how to go through with this situation.  

On one hand, as a doctor, I have always recognized the value of a patient's privacy.  I live in a country where the health privacy laws are not as strongly enforced as they are in the West, both because the legal system and bureaucracy is a massive piece of shit and because of the culture of family over here.  As someone who has encountered other ""doctors"" who are not in the least bit qualified (buying fake medical degrees is big business in India), I feel a special obligation to follow the rules scrupulously and pay extra attention to how I practice medicine.  Though, I recognize that if I were to tell S or M, then legally speaking, I would 90% get away with it. However, I have seen cases where a patient's privacy was not respected and family was told.  That led to a massive shitshow to say the least.  It hurt the patients.  As a doctor, my first priority is to the patients.  I want R to get better.  She is a fantastic human being, and my brother and her keep each other really happy. I imagine what my brother might go through with her if and when he found out.

I just want to say that here there is no abuse.  Both of our parents have done a really done a good job of trying to mold old and new.  While M, who could probably move out financially, still lives with my parents, they respect him as an adult and don't care he is bisexual.  Same with me.  I live close to them, and probably have dinner with them at least 4 times a week.  Similar situation with S and R and their parents.

On the other hand, if I did not tell M and S, it will affect our relationships.  On a rational level, they will recognize my job prevented me from speaking.  But that will not stop the feelings and emotions of betrayal or disappointment, no matter how irrational they may be.  Same goes with my parents and her parents.  S and R are really close as sisters.  I think about her face when she finds out that I knew R had cancer and didn't say anything and I shudder.  I am just praying that R gets well, both because R is a wonderful person and because I fear facing S if she finds out.  

Knowing R, I don't think she will tell anyone, including M, until the treatment or condition really starts getting serious (as if it weren't already), meaning that the symptoms start manifesting themselves physically in a way that can't be hidden.  I have no idea on R's specific diagnosis or how serious it is, although I could find out from hospital records (again, this is something that is morally grey, but legally might not matter).  That is not a place I want to go right now, but I am struggling with this decision.

To complicate matters further, there is a (perhaps small) chance that her case might come to me, depending on the diagnosis and the complications that come in the future.  I am the head of the department of my specialty at my hospital, and her case has a chance of coming to me.  Now I am just imagining really bad situations getting worse... 

TL;DR I am a doctor who found out that my wife's sister, who is also my brother's girlfriend, has cancer.  She is not my patient.  I live in a country where health privacy laws aren't really strict (practically nonexistent), and so could theoretically tell my wife and brother without any trouble.  As a doctor, I know I shoudn't.  I try to make it a point to strictly follow the rules.  Then I imagine my wife and brother when they find out I knew and didn't tell them.  It feels like a morally grey area, sometimes.  I am not going to tell anyone, but I feel so morally conflicted right now.",2019.0,1.0,28.0,15:19:55,abuse
2,16,"I’m(f24) conflicted about generally loving, supportive bf(25) who seemingly doesn’t want to try anymore",2.0,auaaj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/auaaj5/imf24_conflicted_about_generally_loving/,2.0,1551058833.0,"Wanna keep it brief but here’s some background. I’m(f24) a lifelong musician and studied music (including piano, voice, guitar) in college. Bf(25) is a big gamer who’s extremely passionate about music but doesn’t play anything very seriously. Both come from pretty toxic upbringings with abundant psych/emotional abuse, both definitely need therapy, he seems to have very obvious but undiagnosed ADHD. I can overreact, misinterpret and ‘split’ on people (i show some signs of BPD), but i’ve been actively improving my life in big ways lately(including mental health and self esteem), he’s been promising to. I’m desperate at this point for some neutral and objective opinions/advice.

Friday morning, we settled a disagreement where (he fully admitted and apologized) he got annoyed about something really stupid and talked down to me really rudely, almost scolding me, acting like i fucked up or did something wrong when i literally did not.

Later that night after dinner, *he* started a conversation about a weighty topic that i’m pretty informed/passionate about, and as soon as i began giving my thoughts, he just started looking bored af, interrupted me while looking at his phone (which he seems to be doing a lot more lately, but it might just be my imagination, i can mischaracterize and misinterpret things easily) and snapped “are you gonna go get your shit?” (I’d ordered chinese food). I got pissed because i felt disrespected again, and i was in the middle of trying to explain why when he started talking over me. Wasn’t sure what to say at first, and he said, “i feel like i’m talking to a child, you’re so easily offended,” which sounded to me like someone almost admitting that they look down at and talk to me like a child. When i told him not to interrupt me, asked why he wasn’t coming with me to pick up the food and tried to get him to listen, he just smugly smiled, gave a mocking laugh and said in a distinctly demeaning tone, “go get it yourself.” Told him off, walked it off and did exactly that while he spent the WHOLE TIME blowing up my phone.

Got home, no appetite. He was on the couch, just sitting and waiting. Walked by him to the bedroom to blow off steam by playing through some chords on the guitar. He walked in with a bone to pick somehow and i just tried to ignore him and focus on playing, occasionally attempting to get him off my back by just saying “na.” But he wouldn’t let it go. Ripped the chord out of the amp and started yelling that he doesn’t want to deal with my shit anymore, and when i didn’t give him a response, straight up threatened to end the relationship and that if he leaves he’s taking the guitar. 

More background. I make a good amount more than him, so i never minded carrying a little more of the financial burden. I also paid 2/3 of the deposit when we moved to our apartment and had to sell my old bass and acoustic, which was hard for me. I’ve also been heartbroken the past couple years not having a piano anymore for other reasons (i studied intensely from age 5-22). Back in summer we split a nintendo switch evenly, also “split” a guitar, meaning i bought an amp, chord, strap, etc (about $140) and he bought the guitar (about $90). 

Now he wouldn’t leave me alone after i asked repeatedly, and tried to get the guitar away from me while demanding that i hand it over, saying “but it’s mine, you’re really going to take the guitar **I** bought?” I was in disbelief, but said “you can have the Switch,” and he just said “i don’t want it” in the most petty, insincere way. When he realized i wasn’t going to willingly hand him the instrument, he started threatening to take all his furniture back and asked if i really wanted him to leave, to which i said i guessed so if he was going to be like this. “Well i’m taking all my stuff back, including the bed.” He started lifting up the mattress, trying (and nearly succeeding) to dump me off the bed *in the direction of the amp, on top of which happened to be two cherished pieces of framed art from my late grandparents’ home, with the guitar and my $2,000 laptop which went tumbling towards my face (while i’m wearing glasses) and i had to catch it, while still holding onto the guitar mind you, before it hit the floor.* 

More more background, he’s broken a couple of my belongings before which happened to be deeply valuable to me, each time claiming it was accidental, and i’ve believed him each time, not having a reason not to. But he did intentionally slam his iphone 7+ at the floor and break it during an argument once, only to go about cheerfully obsessing and bragging about his fancy new one a couple days later.

Nothing broke. I placed my computer on the ground but kept hold of the guitar which of course had randomly hit and badly bruised the same knee that i’ve seriously injured before, requiring 4 months of physical therapy and still gives me problems occasionally. He stopped trying to get me off the bed and i freaked out at him again, asking what the fuck his deal is and telling him to leave me alone, and he kept saying “not going anywhere without the guitar.”  I told him it would be unwise to just walk out of the apartment with it in the rain with nowhere to go, but if he wanted to leave i wasn’t going to stop him. Maybe he should worry about ‘his’ stuff when he had somewhere to put it. Quickly devolved into him getting all emotional about not wanting to move back with his admittedly abusive parasite of a mom, saying how he doesn’t really have other options of where to live (he has a ton of very loyal long-term friendships), asking me not to do this to him, saying he just wants to go “off” himself. He can’t believe this is happening, he just ruins every good thing in his life, and so on.

I pointed out how messed up and manipulative it is to threaten to hurt yourself and reminded him that’s what his mom does, and it turned into him begging, saying how i’m his life and he won’t know what to do, promising to get into therapy and get better (which i’ve been imploring him to do for a year and a half).

As of now we both still live here until further notice but i’ve instructed him on no uncertain terms to just leave me alone. I know we’re both pretty fucked up, but we can also make such a good team sometimes, and he can honestly be so sweet and make me laugh like no one else at times. Because of our shared history of going through a lot of psychological abuse and how genuinely compatible our personalities can be, there are moments at our best that i’m convinced i’ve never felt less alone than i feel with him. 

I just feel angry, confused and scared- i don’t have many friends available and close by, as many of my closest friends are either insanely busy with work and/or personal life or moved really far away (i.e. Boston, India, Minnesota.. i live in Pennsylvania). My job is pretty independent and isolated as i work in-home caring for and homeschooling a child with disabilities, so i don’t really have much chance to make friends through work. My family life has been in a continuous state of shattering and restructuring itself in slow motion for years, and i feel lost.

So what now?

I just don’t know where to go from here. I’ve agreed to THINK about giving him another chance, since pretty much owns up to everything, and has agreed to make big changes, and FINALLY called his ins. company to start finding a therapist (i’ve been pushing him on this for a year and a half, mostly because of issues with his mom), but this weekend he’s still:

 1.sorta acting helpless, like he’s not capable of figuring the insurance/therapy shit out for himself and needs my help for some reason, when he’s comparatively very capable of figuring things out and spending time looking up helpful information when he wants to get through a level on one of his video games or something. And he’ll learn every detail about a new piece of tech he wants before he buys it. 

2. Acting somewhat entitled and not seeming to know what equal effort/contribution looks like at times, not totally valuing my time. 

3. Doing little things that i’ve told him like a broken record make me feel ignored or disrespected, when they’re SUCH simple, easy things to not do like walking ahead of me at the store.

TL;DR: BF and I work together so well at times and have helped each other through a lot of bullshit from our abusive childhoods, but he just seems to be dragging his feet and unwilling to change certain things when I ask to be treated with more respect. A ridiculous and possibly abusive (???) blow-up this weekend showed that things are going downhill fast if he doesn’t start taking me seriously and prioritizing his mental health and fixing his issues.

Is it even worth waiting to see if therapy will help at this point?

3,25,Girlfriend [23F] gets incredibly depressed after reading the news every day. She always seeks out sad stories to obsess over. How can I [24M] help her stop?,3.0,7yc5pt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7yc5pt/girlfriend_23f_gets_incredibly_depressed_after/,8.0,1518957874.0,"So this is a weird problem. My gf of 3 years is very well-read, studied political science in university, and always keeps up with the news. However, she has had this issue where she reads all a chain of newspapers every morning, then gets depressed for the rest of the day because certain articles just really bummed her out. 

This happened only once in a while when we first started dating but has gotten worse over time. Now, she gets sad 2-3 times every week and it disrupts her mood for the entire day. She complains that the stories from the news make her feel stressed out and like ""the weight of the world is on her shoulders."" The thing is, she also LOVES to seek out the really depressing stories, like long articles on animal farming abuses, child trafficking, sex slavery, poverty in 3rd world countries, etc. You get the idea. 

I think it's amazing that she's so tuned in to these subjects, but it affects her mood constantly and so viscerally that I'm getting really fed up with it to be honest. This past Valentine's day, I rushed home early just so I could cook her a big romantic meal. She then spent the entire night complaining about the injustices of this world because she read about a big textile company that was screwing over child laborers in India. Not once did she thank me or mention how nice the meal was. She ended up finishing only half her meal, sighing deeply, then went to bed super early because she claimed her heart felt too heavy again. 

Sometimes I feel selfish for wanting her to be more present, because she is a very compassionate person and she cares a lot about these big global issues. But sometimes I also feel like she purposefully inflicts herself with these types of negative news. She's been to therapy for anxiety, and this issue has been mentioned to her therapist who recommended she take breaks from reading her usual stories. She got mad and told me that therapist wanted her to practice ""ignorance."" So, yeah. She isn't going to stop reading her news. 

I'm also getting really sick of her constant doom and gloom attitude. She is really negative now about nearly everything that isn't profound or deep enough for her. Like if I'm watching a dumb comedy movie after work to unwind, she'll roll her eyes and go to the bedroom and close the door. If we go out with friends, she acts bored if we're talking about anything beyond the topics she feels are important enough. Or if someone brings something up that excites them, she usually finds a way to insinuate they're not as educated on the subject as they think. Example: Friend brings up cute story about a cheetah and dog becoming friends at a zoo. Gf brings up that this has been happening for a long, long time, that it's actually not so cute, and zoos are actually terrible for various reasons. It's also her attitude which can be very condescending and puts people off. 

Yeah, the prevailing issue is still that she likes to intentionally burden herself with lots of negative news but doesn't seem to realize it. She also hates simple happy things for the sole reason that they're not profound or thought provoking enough. What can I do at this point? It's been a gradual change, but is this a sign of a deeper incompatibility, or should I just sit her down and tell her that she's been annoying everyone, including me?

-------

**tldr**: Gf likes to read really depressing news stories then becomes very negative for days on end. She doesn't want to stop, but her attitude has been very grating on me and lots of friends. I feel like she looks down on things that are simply happy for being too ""simple."" What should I do? Is this a sign of a deeper incompatibility?",2018.0,2.0,18.0,18:29:34,abuse
4,36,Abuse and emotional issues between inter-cultural couple - me [35M] Indian with my wife 35[F] French,37.0,2sec7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2sec7a/abuse_and_emotional_issues_between_intercultural/,25.0,1421270928.0,"I am 35 Male who lived all my life in India and work in the IT sector with a reasonably stable job. She is 35 F from Paris, lived mostly in France but traveled a lot, doesn't have big college education due to family issues. We met because of a shared interest through the internet and also because she loved and traveled to India many times.



We are living together in a metropolis in India for 19 months and married since 5 months. 
She has been accepted and loved by my parents and family and we visit them once in 2 months or so. Her family (mother and step sister) visited us for the marriage and we had a great 2 week trip with them. 



Prior to that I had a string of long term relationships but none materialized to marriage and she too had the same, only difference was she was living with her BF's. We both suffered from anxiety and depression issues and also took medications for that. All this shared history, common issues and shared interests were good enough for us to live together and get married, although we had a lot of anxious times in the run-up to the marriage. We both didn't believe in marriage because of the broken marriages we saw in our respective families. Her mother had divorced from her father and married another man and did not have any contact with her throughout her teen years. My parents though stayed together but have been fighting almost everyday all throughout my childhood.  But when we met and saw the connection with each other we both thought this was the person.



We are generally very happy with each other and seem to still have a strong connection and great sex life. We are waiting for another 6 months to have her work authorization in India.
She has generally adjusted very well to India, helping out with buying groceries, keeping the house with the help of maids etc. But she feels alone many times due to her inability to speak Hindi fluently (she did a 1 month course but needs practice), because she is still staying at home and like me she an introvert. 


Our relationship started after she decided to leave her 7 years old live-in partner, but she says she was planning to do it for last 3 years and was tempted only when she found me. 
I was in a 3 years dysfunctional relationship also without the courage to separate or take it to the next level. Around the beginning she looked at my chat history and found me flirting with another girl (happened when she has went back to renew her visa). The jist was at that time I was not sure how this relationship will go, will she go back and change her mind and move in again with her BF or come back to India, I really didn't trust her completely. Also I was uncomfortable to share our live-in relationship status with everyone in India since it is frowned upon. So I just chatted with this girl on facebook and told her I was NOT in a relationship and just praised her a bit. This single incident created a huge furore, she still can not completely get over it even when I have deleted that woman from my facebook and have no contact with her. Further I have tried my best to reassure her that nothing is going in her back even leaving my email accounts open and offering to leave my phone at home. But the issue still remains in the back of her head.



The problem is that we have been having really ugly fights which have recently escalated to hitting each other. It starts with varied reasons - trust issues, sharing finances, sharing housework etc which I think can be solved if we argue with reason but we both loose our temper. She starts shouting on me and then I react with disproportionate force - including name calling and then sometimes hitting each other. During the run-up to the marriage we both thought it was just temporary stress but now it looks like ingrained. We bring up the bad thing we have done in the past - my alleged ""cheating"" via facebook chat and her abandoning her BF for 7 years in a matter of days, and then it escalates.



She says I am an abusive person, which I admit (partly because of my alcoholic and abusive father). I have started to see a counselor just last week to resolve my abuse issues. She has agreed to take therapy as well for her over-reactions, trust issues and feelings of being abandoned. I am not at all justifying the abuse because of her behavior, it is my problem that needs to resolved by me. I am researching about abuse on the internet and trying to get as much help as possible - given that we don't have much support networks for abuse perpetrators in India. In hindsight I feel I may have been rushed into our marriage, but it was unavoidable since otherwise we couldn't have carried on this long distance relationship. I took a leap of faith thinking our emotional bond will resolve all the issues. And right now I am very much in love with her and completely devoted to have my life with her forever and I want it to work whatever it takes.



I never thought going to the internet solves relationships issues, but in this case I think I can get help to have the ""western and independent perspective"" too which my local friends can not provide.  Question is are we doing it right, anything that might help us from personal or anecdotal experience. Please don't suggest we need to breakup because of both of us dont want that.

UPDATE - 16/01/2015: I just got an opportunity to travel out of the country for a week on work. Incidentally this is the same country where the woman I chatted with (story above, who I have cut all contact with now) resides. I am trying if my wife can come with me but it is not certain I may be able to (because of sharing the transport/lodgings with my work mate). This the first opportunity for me to travel abroad in my 13 years career and incidentally it has come now when me are in the midst of fixing ourselves. This has created a huge uproar between us. She feels I am going there to cheat on her. I have tried to reason with utmost patience -- that I want to take you with me, let us try to work out how best we can do that but no guarantees. But she doesn't want to listen to any of it and is thinking of leaving me. I am at a total loss of what to do now.

I've been called overly patient and pushy. I have developed a kind of hyper focus on self knowledge. I feel like I sometimes overcompensate for my difficulty with interpersonal skills. Tend to be attracted to women who are messed up emotionally. I suspect it is because of my mother. I am not successful in either aspect of life when it comes to professional and personal realms. I do think however, that I have made a LOT of progress in my time trying to figure relationship stuff out. This includes Being social on other levels like business and friendship. I probably have Asperger's syndrome.


My recent relationships were with 24f who were abused as kids and live in societies that are steeped in tradition over more modern ways of dealing with emotional and mental issues. My last three relationships were with women who are from China, Greece, and India. These women are full of thinking errors and all have plenty of experience with emotional abuse and two of them physical abuse.


I met a woman recently (online) who doesn't seem (on the surface) to suffer these types of problems/weights.


My question is. **How can I get out of the mode I've come to find myself in, when being with my SO?** I am inclined to want to be as open as possible and share everything about my past and current perspective on relationships. Who I've been with and how I have come to be. I want to ask her what her past experiences have been like to gauge how to be a good partner for her.

6,43,I (28F) can't deal with my sister (26F) anymore. I don't know what to do.,1.0,7p5lrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7p5lrq/i_28f_cant_deal_with_my_sister_26f_anymore_i_dont/,3.0,1515512530.0,"My sister, has always been difficult, even when she was young. My whole family has walked on eggshells as her moods would swing unpredictably and I think us being so careful around her has contributed to how she acts now. I was always top of my school, while she was always in the top 30ish, but because we didn't want to upset her (she would always call me the golden child even though this wasn't true) we could NEVER celebrate anything I've achieved. Instead it was always 'don't say anything, it will upset her'. I think this is another reason - low self esteem.

But since we both moved out of home, it's gotten much worse. As we have always lived at least 2+ hours from each other, she would go through periods of not talking to me for a year plus.

The first time was in approx. 2012 because I booked a trip to Europe before her, despite me always planning to go to London and her saying our small coastal town was all she would ever need. I had no idea she wanted to go, but apparently I stole this from her.

The second time was because I didn't believe that she was on deaths door when we were both in India. I had lived there for a year and was in charge of crisis management for 600+ young students, and I hearing this kind of thing all the time. I followed protocol, but she was convinced that I was trying to kill her. This manifested by her telling my new (and current) boyfriend that I was a psycho, and my Dad and I hate each other to try and break us up.

The third time it was because after I found out I had landed a job at a very prestigious organisation, she responded by telling my parents (from Malaysia where she was volunteering) that she was now on the board of directors of a multi-million dollar company (despite being a first year undergraduate with no work experience or even internships), and a man had told her she could get a very lucrative government scholarship - but had to pay him $10,000 if she got it. 

My Dad called me very upset, and I told him that sounded very dodgy and she should be careful. She started to yell at us all, telling my hysterical Mum that she 'wouldn't even tell her when she got home from Malaysia' and that we didn't ever support her. Anyway, for that one I was blocked on Facebook for over 1.5 years.

Now, she's back living with my parents and I live in a town 1.5 hours away. We had a family get together on Sunday, and she told everyone her eyes had changed from brown to green. My whole family told her it wasn't true, and she defended herself. I was sitting next to her, and told her her eyes were brown. She got very defensive but I thought that was the end of the story. The next day, a cousin posted in a family chat that we should cook our Grandma's recipes for our next get together. I wrote back 'I shotgun pumpkin soup' because this was my favourite meal that Grandma cooked and her signature dish. I then got the following message from my sister:
""Can I honestly ask why you still act like a child with me. You turned that green eye thing yesterday into the most ridiculous argument all I was saying is I randomly now have green in my eyes and you had to attack me like it matters? I already told you I was making grandmas pumpkin soup weeks ago so you shotgun it on Facebook. I don't understand why you have to still be like this with me, I don't like doing this anymore, I don't know how else to explain it to you... don't bother seeing me anymore.""

I was dumbfounded. My Dad is sick, and she just ended a relationship so I understand she's stressed, but now I don't even know how to NOT upset her? 

My Mum and boyfriend agree, but tell me she's just stressed and to be nice.

I offered to talk through our 'communications issues', and admitted that this is a two way problem and we need to learn to talk, and she isn't responding to me. I called my Mum to talk to her, and she refused to answer the phone.

2 weeks ago, I mentioned that I wanted to fly QANTAS because I have a severe fear of flying, and she told me she would never travel with me because I don't know how to backpack. I told her I did, and she started yelling at me, saying I was attacking her. She ran to her room crying. I went and knocked on her door, and she wouldn't open it. She came out an hour later with tears pouring down her face, and told us she wasn't coming to the family movie day we had planned because I was a bitch.

I just really don't know how to talk to her. I think she's struggling but this has been a pattern her whole life - she once ran away from home and told everyone Mum was abusing her because Mum wouldn't let her use the car because she was drink driving. My Mum works hard, is stressed about Dad, and hates to see us fight. I'm sick of seeing my Mum cry over my Sister telling her she'll never talk to anyone again, so my Mum is forced to give in so she won't disappear for a year+. But she's 26 now, what do I do?

If anyone has a similar problem please help!

I met a lot of people and made some good friends.


I met a woman who is from India.  We REALLY connected and had a great time. We ended up doing things she had never done before. It was such a rush. But it ended with us parting ways because we are both dependant on our parents.


Her parents want her to marry some guy who she doesn't like. They are very controlling. She doesn't leave the house because of the area they live in.
She basically lives on the internet as a way to cope with her (in my opinion horrible) parents. She plays games on her phone and most of her friends there are kids. She is educated and has a degree but is struggling to figure out her life path.


It turns out she had some men who she had relationships **over chat only** who are still interested in her. But its complicated because while we were intimate in person. She has been intimate via chat for longer and so she is struggling with her residual feelings for them. One of them it just didn't work out and the other disappeared suddenly a month before she met me. But they are both still chatting with her. I trust her. She says that:


**But she is with me now.**


I am struggling with feeling insecure because of her mostly male friends and especially her ex boyfriend who she still kinda has feelings for because of how their relationship ended. I dont know what to do though about her ex ""chat boyfriends"" potentially spend hours chatting with her. She says that **she wont get back with them whatever happens** even if we break up. Part of me is screaming to myself ""get out while she is still has feelings for her ex"" and the other part of me is crying that ""this isnt fair"" and wondering ""why i seem to get the crazy women...""


She kinda flirts with a lot of people on chat or at least allows them to flirt with her. I feel like the chats she has are a kind of mechanism for her to get dopamine. Family life is yelling and emotional abuse. So internet chat life is a haven where she can have happy conversations all the time.


My main plan is to get her away from her abusive family. I feel like if we can cut out the toxic elements in her life then she wont need to chat with these people to feel good. When we were together she rarely played games or chatted. She wants to leave her home so this our plan.
I dont have a whole lot of this kind of (or any serious) relationship experience
I have googled, ""her ex boyfriends are her bestfriends"" or something like that to try and get others insight...

I am 26y/o male living in a house with my family currently diagnosed bipolar and experiencing hidden aggression from my family. In my family, is my father 56 years old, mother 58 years old (which I love), sister in law 27 years and grand father and grand mother passed away 5 months ago.


I am undergraduate engineer from a well reputed school in country, with some work experience. In last two years me and my friend we decided to launch an app company in which we all worked really hard however when we were close to getting funded the control and equity game split the company and thus nothing came from it. I was really into programming and still wanted to get a job as programmer but due to lack of experience and not having an undergrad in computer science I kept on losing in the interviews. I was so depressed at my job one day that I thinking of nothing applied for a computer science degree. This was in April. The house we lived in was split between my brother 25%, I 25% and mom/Dad 50%. To go into this program, I would have to study full time for alteast 1 year after which I could potentially land a co-op. This situation really bothered my brother as I would not be able to pay full 25% of the mortgage so decided on me renting the basement room I used to live in and I would make up for rest of the cash monthly. 


It really bothered me how much my brother and my dad cared about me paying a full share of mortgage given I had bought my dad/mom a $2500LCD TV, another $2000 TV for living room, gave my brother $6000 when he bought his first car 2 years ago which was $14,500 Camry Hybrid (which he stopped sharing 1 years ago), plus renovated the house by paying for paint for 8 rooms and then painting each room on my own. When I bought a car my brother gave me $2500 and I chipped in $2500 for 2003 Camry. My brother paid $1000 for the stainless steel stove and I did not chip in any money because I was saving to go to school.


In August, my grand mother passed away and with one month left to go to school things really got messy. Around this time, I started to experience a lot of covert aggression from my dad, brother and mother. They would covertly remind me of that I would only be making part of the payment for mortgage, when I would bring up that they should just talk to me straight, they would say I am thinking too much and should think less. But the aggression did not stop and they kept on covertly shamming, guilt tripping and I felt really shamed, harasssed and guilted. At one point, I offered to reduce my share of the property and give it to my brother and dad/mom. They got angrier and guilted me by saying ”that is this what I think of them”. I try to talk to my brother one day about how he felt, he got furious and when straight to my father and the whole family ganged up on me. I lost it that day, I became super manic broke the coffee table with my head and try to self harm and suicide. My mother and dad stopped me from doing it but I had lost all the respect and felt they had also lost any respect they had for me.


Come September I joined university. After about a month into my studies I started smoking W regularly (I did this before), got busy with studies and effectively started looking for gf. I though having a gf, someone I could share this with would really help me. Therefore, I started reading self help, body language books, and effects of touch and started talking to a lot of women on buses, campus and everywhere and used these “techniques”. I did not succeed and soon received the identity of that guy on the campus. At this point girls would just play with me and cancel plans last minute, this started irritating me so I became furious, paranoid and psychosis. I felt like the whole campus was after me. I called home and asked my dad to come take me home. He shows up next day and I was go thankful to god and him that I would get home now. That evening he started to drink, and kept on drinking till we landed in my home town and abusing me throughout our drive/flight. He stayed sober for few days and then he started to going through cycles of 5 day/night drunk 2 days sober. One day I got really depressed and I saw he was getting stressed so I went to emergency. I was hospitalized for 7 days and discovered that I was bipolar, so I got on bipolar pills. The news of what I did in University to get a gf spread out in my hometown and everywhere I went people would taunt me or use there body language to remind me of the incident. 


God knows how, I had the energy, patients, and forgiveness for all these people and I just kept on ignoring them and going my way. I also felt conditioned, when ever I would come across someone new I would look to see if they “knew”. I stopped looking at people, girls would still play me and my brother and sister in law taunted with similar sign. I decided to talk to my parent about how I felt about my brother and sister in law.


They assured me that I am seeing things and I need to increase my pill sizes and that I should book an appointment with my doctor. I went to my doc got a bigger pills. The public harassment did not stop, harassment from my brother and sister in law did not stop. I continued living in house because what else could I do, if I got an interview, the interviewer would just remind me of university by showing me same signs and not follow up. We decided to get curtain, me and my dad decided to go get curtains. At the shop when we selected all the curtain rods my dad had the expectation that I should pay for them. At the moment I did not think much and let him pay for them. Once, me my dad and my brother were watching TV. Dad and brother talked out of blue “that some people do not get anything in life and should just accept below average” another time they talked about “some people brain is so fucked up what are they here to fix other people” and every time they talked they knew how I felt from my facial expretions about these topics. They would take a jab at my emotions and quickly change topics. Soon, my dad started to show me the signs that I experienced at university and when I try to talk to him he quickly change topic and asked me to go to on bigger pills. 


All this has left a whole in my chest which may never be filled, and I have no clue what to do at this point. I though about my past and found similar evidence:

1.	Once I called 911 on my dad because he would not stop beating my mother.(which we both took our statements back)
2.	Once he caught drunk driving.
3.	We have had numerous physical, verbal fights when he would not stop drinks for days.
4.	I would be leaving house to write university exam and dad would be walking into the house drunk.
5.	I have been beaten up by my dad as a child atleast once a month from grade 1 to 9, IN grade 10 that’s when we migrated to Canada from India. (never seen my brother touched)
6.	My brother was a high scorer and top of the class throughout all this
7.	Every time we go out to buy something for the house (lights, paints, curtain, curtain rods, electronics) my dad would take me with him and covertly expect me to pay. 
8.	When ever my friends’ family invited us to join them my dad would show up drunk right before we were suppose to leave
9.	My dad tried to get me to sign a blank sheet of paper
10.	I experienced that my dad has starting to condition me into doing what he wants by reward mechanism.
11.	He and my family has the expectation that I am the one suppose to fix things around the house (taps, plugs, lights, installing curtains, blinds, painting rooms, wiring etc. ) If I don’t I get guilted, shamed. My brother has never had to do anything like this.
12.	I have about $10,000 saved up and he wanted me to transfer it to his account and when I revolted he turned my whole family against me.
13.	When he came to get me at the university he fought with me the whole time.
14.	Last night he tried to turn my mother against me.
15.	In my childhood, I remember him making me polish the entire families’ shoes.
16.	In my childhood, I would wash everyone’s cars, scooter (it was an expectations)
17.	My parents still owe me $9,000 dollars, they have yet to pay me.
18.	I have been constantly reminded that I am in Canada because to them.
19.	When I was fat, mom/dad ask me to go to gym. When I lost all the weight they guilt tripped me for going to gym a lot.
20.	When I was not studying, I was beaten and called dumb. When I really started to study they were not supportive.
21.	When I am not helping the family, they are mean and remind me of it constantly
22.	When I am consciously changing my habits to support (loading dishwasher, laundry, cleaning, vaccum) they say I am acting and don’t really mean it. 


tl;dr: I feel so lonely, helpless and I am bipolar as I have not idea what to do at this point in my life. My dad, brother, grand dad, sister in law are ganged up on me and not a single day goes by without there taunting and they don’t tell me what they want from me. This environment is so toxic, I can not land a job because of my past. I am cornered and feel I will go crazy.

10,70,Should he follow through with divorce? Sexual issues based in abuse surface...,4.0,16xl6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16xl6l/should_he_follow_through_with_divorce_sexual/,14.0,1358726288.0,"**tl;dr Man in a sexless marriage with no emotional or physical intimacy wants a divorce...meets and falls in love with another woman...but then finds out the reason wife won't have sex is because she was raped at age 12. Is he a horrible person to still leave??**


Me: white female 34yrs, him: Indian male, 30yrs. Been dating 2 months. 


So I wrote out the whole saga and it took up 7 pages of a Word document. Reddit has character limits and it wouldn’t fit here, so this is the very abridged version. Hopefully you’ll get the gist. Know that we are truly and deeply in love like we’ve never felt before...


So when he gets home on Jan 5 he comes straight to my house from the airport. We sit down and talk. He reiterates how much he loves me and then gives me a key to his apartment, says he wants to be open with me moving forward. Then he proceeds to tell me a long story. 


He has tears in his eyes and his hands are visibly shaking. He begins by talking about a girlfriend he had 7 years ago. Tells how it's very different in India and people don't really date there and girls definitely don't have sex before marriage or barely even make out. He tells how he moved here to US to begin his Masters degree, and a year and a half later she moved here also to begin hers. 


And then he drops the bomb that they got married. And are still currently married. WTF. 


My heart sank and I was in disbelief. The whole time I was afraid that he'd go get an arranged marriage but he actually already had a wife. I'm a very calm person and tend to hold back and collect all the facts before freaking out in situations. So I sat there and listened how they've been married for 4 years now. But he discovered after they married that she has no interest in sex. In the four years they've been married they've had intercourse barely 5 times. At first he understood it was new for her and probably just needed time to become comfortable. But it never came. He told how they have absolutely no physical intimacy and he has tried to help her through it with no success. They've gone to doctors for hormone level testing. He's tried reading books together on the topic. He gave up for over a year and never pressured her for sex. He tried to convince himself that he could live for the rest of his life without ever having sex. I suggested that it's got to be deeper than just a lack of desire; something must have happened in her past such as rape or abuse but he insists that's not it. He was a virgin too when they married. 


He explained that they are close friends and never fight, but they have the same relationship he has with his mother with no sexuality whatsoever. He has been miserable but at the same time has struggled with deciding if lack of sex is a good enough reason to divorce. Divorce is a huge taboo in his culture and people almost never do it. I already knew this from my research and knew that divorce can bring such shame to a family that if a girl gets divorced, her unmarried sisters run a great risk of never finding someone who will marry them. We live on the east coast where he just moved in August, and the wife is back in the midwest where she is still working on her PhD. He says they have not lived together for 2 years. He had moved to another state in the midwest to finish his studies and take a separation from her. He says he has told her he wants a divorce long before he met me and that she was aware that he began dating people a few months ago. Granted that's bullshit he was out dating while married.


A week later his phone rings at 1:30am so he answers and begins to kind of freak out. He gets off quickly and is frantic, saying that it was his brother asking him what's going on with his marriage. Apparently the wife has said something to his family who is demanding to Skype with him. He practically jumps out of bed and flies out the door to go home and Skype with them. I'm hurt and angry. I lay there realizing that I need to end it. I can't go on like this; it's wrong and I don't deserve this shit. I can't sleep. At 3:30 he calls me and then comes back over to see me.


This is where it gets interesting. He comes over and is so upset, sobbing. Explains that the wife is going fucking nuts and finally told him the reason she won't have sex... She was raped many years ago and has never told a soul. I was not one bit surprised. I thought it was pretty obvious from the beginning. Now he feels even more guilt than he already did for leaving her. Says he's a horrible person, he left her when she needed him, etc. Apparently she was talking suicide too. I felt for him and understand that he feels an obligation to help her. He says he's going to see her in the morning. I agree that he should. I'm sad as hell but I love him so much and don't want him to be in pain. I tell him that now that this news has surfaced, I understand if he wants to work it out with her. He's just really confused and not sure what to do. Says he still wants me. He’s gone for several days before he comes back.


So Thursday finally comes and it was my regularly scheduled therapy day. I told my therapist that I'm expecting to be dumped later that night. She says she doesn't think so. She thinks he truly loves me and their marriage was over long ago and is irreparable. I go over to his place scared. He gives me a big long hug. Then tells me about the week. When he got there Monday night she was crazy. She was trying to chug NyQuil and wine. I know it's serious but honestly that sounds like a lame cry for attention. But she also tried cutting herself in front of him with a blade. Then she got scissors but wasn't trying to hurt herself anymore. She shredded a shawl that he had bought her years ago. Shredded the t -shirt she was wearing. Cut off chunks of her hair. He said she was delusional and speaking crazy. She started looking for the cut hair saying that like everything else, her hair had left her. She was clinging onto the ball of shredded shirt saying at least it wouldn't leave her like everybody else in her life. He said it was terrifying and like nothing he's ever seen before. 


We talked about us and what to do. He says he absolutely wants to be with me. Wants to marry me, have kids with me. He loves me in a way he never had with her. We decided that we should stop seeing each other until everything is sorted out. He wants to be with me but he is torn between doing what would make him happy (be with me) and what he feels obligated to do (fulfill his commitment to his marriage especially now that the rape has surfaced). So now I’m trying not to, but am stuck in this in-between phase waiting for him to make a decision. 


So what do you think?? I DO NOT want to hear what a terrible person I am for carrying on with a married man. I get it. I want to know **What do you think about his obligation to stay with her now that she told him she was raped 18 years ago? Was it unfair on her part to keep that from him and hurt him all these years? Should he sacrifice his happiness and suffer for the rest of his life by staying with her even though he no longer loves her and has seen what a complete relationship is like and finally has the love he's wanted all these years with somebody else ?**


If you've made it this long, thanks for reading. 

**UPDATE** We just met and talked. I planned on telling him we can't have contact until a certain date but he beat me to it lol. We decided that he will call me on Thursday after his therapy appointment and we'll see where we're at. Then we will not have contact again until the following Thursday when we go to my therapist together. At that point he will have to have made a decision. If the decision is to stay in the marriage or he's still undecided then I am absolutely done and will gracefully exit the picture. I gave him a journal to help him sort all of this out and encouraged him to organize his thoughts and bring it to the therapist with him. I do feel this is worth making an effort for but I cannot drag it out for much longer. We both agree that we need to deal with this quickly and not continue to hurt everybody involved.

11,71,My (23M) Parents found out I have a GF (20F) and that we have had sex. Now they're disappointed and blaming her.,6.0,2rdseh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2rdseh/my_23m_parents_found_out_i_have_a_gf_20f_and_that/,6.0,1420472220.0,"So, this is gonna be a long and confusing rant/discussion. I honestly need to write this out for myself and if others can read it and give input on my situation it would be an added bonus. It has a ton to do with my family background, so lemme start there.

I’m the oldest of three, a 23 y/o graduate student studying PA in the US. My family is the first generation to come to America from our country (India). I and my other siblings were born here. My parents came here some 30 years ago with very little money, but since have grown into a fairly successful couple worth around a few million in assets. 

The children weren’t very spoiled, but we have all the opportunities and luxuries we need (not desire). We haven’t paid for college/graduate school; parents paid the remainder of our bills after all our scholarships: around 10k per child per year. We have nice cars, but not top of the line BMWs or Audis. Overall a comfortable life and our parents have done everything they can for us.

They are absolutely wonderful people. I love them, and I always will. I do have plans on taking care of them when I eventually get my career started which is going to take another two-three years for school to finish. Honestly they are the only reason I am where I am today. They have never told me “no” to anything specific, they always pushed me to be the very best I can possibly be. And I see their effect on all three of us. I’m not the top of my class, but both my siblings graduated top 10 from HS and right now we all have excellent GPAs and excellent resumes. If everything keeps up we do see ourselves being just as successful as our parents, my siblings probably much more. We all would be nothing without their influence on our lives. 

They expect very little in return from us. They told us to enjoy life, enjoy our friends. But be careful of relationships. It was always implied to not date, don’t bring home girls (or boys for my sister). Never anything directed at one of us, but just here and there. Always do good in school. This was a biggie. Just excel at school, bottom line. And don’t drink or smoke.

I however, so far have dented my record a few times here and there. I’ve lied to them about my standings about school in the past. They have found out, but after I was cornered into admitting my less than par grades. Grades weren’t abyssal, just not what they expected and not what I should have been bringing in. This was early freshman year of college. Since then I have completely stepped up my game and currently am doing fairly well. I’ve never smoke or drunk before (surprising! Yes, especially for a college student), but my best friends have drunk at my house before and my parents were kinda upset at that. (best friends = for the whole house, all my family loves these 3 guys/girls. They’re very trusted and part of the family for the past 10+ years).

**However, a big incident just happened a few days ago. They found out about my girlfriend, and that we were having sex. Uhhhh.**

**I was out with my friends and my dad was using my car. Found a box of condoms in my trunk. Fuck.**

Anyway. At first I denied it, and told him it was my friends. He had my back as much as possible but things got twisted and I admitted it. Shit hit the fan.

There was no yelling. No screaming. No fists no violence. Just tears from my mom. My dad visibly upset and breaking down. I haven’t seen him like this. Ever. In my 25 years and through two family deaths my dad has been the family’s rock. Anchor. Stronghold. Whatever the fuck you wanna call it. And I saw him in the weakest position possible… It broke my heart. I broke down. They didn’t ever expect this from me. Never. I was dating a girl? Okay, not a problem. But SEX. No… In their mind a girl doesn’t give up her virginity for a guy before marriage. Unless she’s a whore. A slut. That’s their mindset. I can’t change it. I don’t want to change it. They’re who they are due to their beliefs.

My parents have met her before. But from my sisters side. She’s also my sister’s very close friend. She’s been over before. She’s sat next to my dad and mother chilling and watching TV with them. While we were going out… I never told them. She never told them. They didn’t have any idea. They liked her back then. She was a nice girl. A little goofy but she’s taking care of their daughter. They’re happy and glad she’s there. Now? Oh no.. She’s a bad girl, she’s a slut she’s going to impose these ideals upon our daughter… 
They were disappointed in me. They didn’t blame me though. They blame my GF. She tricked me into this because of my family’s wealth. She was after the money and if it was true love it would have not advanced to sex. Not yet. Not until marriage. My dad’s opinions are set in stone. They’re very very difficult to change, if at all. He wants me to first of all stop having sex. And second, urged me to break up with her. My mom agreed with the first 100%, and she said that I could find a better girl, someone who’s more in line with my family and their beliefs. Someone much more beautiful. Someone Indian.

Okay. We’ll stop having sex. My parents have done everything for me. And I want to respect them. I’ll stop. I have no trouble stopping, and neither does my GF. We’ve talked about this before, what if someone found out and what not. Sex is great and all, but it’s really not the foundation of our relationship. So now that I’ve given a semi-detailed breakdown of my family side let me switch over to my GF side of this.

I’ve known her (20F, Sri Lankan) for a little more than a year now, and been dating her for 10 months. We had sex for the first time around 2 months ago. Both of us virgin. She’s had a rocky past. Her parents are abusive. She lives with them and they still hit her. After **TWENTY FUCKING YEARS**. I’ve seen the bruises. I’ve seen her legs and her arms. No matter what mood I’m in, I instantly am filled with rage against her father. She’s still in college and currently she has no way of moving out which won’t financially destroy her. Her savings and paychecks are going towards college expenses and books when needed. Her parents have 0 care for her. I’ve heard their conversations. I can’t even express how this makes me feel. I have no power in this. She can’t live with me, I’m fully depending on my parents as well. She can’t afford her own place, and there’s no one else for her here. 

Last year around Christmas she broke up with her ex and had an incredibly large argument and fight (in this case figurative and literal) with her parents. I wasn’t going out with her at this point, Just a friend. She couldn’t take it. She felt absolutely alone. No one was there for her. She tried to commit suicide, overdosed with medicine. Thankfully it didn’t work. She was in the hospital for a few days, but released. She called her aunt/uncle in England, the only other adult influence in her life. They were taken back. They forced her parents to send her over to them for Christmas break. All I knew was: Oh cool my friend’s going to England. I wonder what she’ll bring back for me. At this time I knew nothing about her parents or her life at all. We hung out a bit here and there but nothing intimate. Nothing alone. She didn’t know much about me. I didn’t know much about her.

She comes back; the next semester starts. We have better schedules. We see each other much more often. Nearly every day. Hang out nearly every day. Start texting often. Before I knew it, we were cuddling and watching movies. Just hanging out. Talking. I didn’t know what was gonna happen. One day we were sitting in my car getting food and just talking. I’m like: let’s go in the back, I’m kinda tired. We got in the back, cuddle. I kiss her once. Awkward 10 minutes of hehehe, hahaha, I kiss her again. We’re making out. Few days later we’re a couple, all happy and whatnot. Our friends are happy. I tell my sister and brother: but shh don’t tell mom and dad.

Two months in she tells me she loves me… **FINALLY**. I wanted to say it for a week or so now. Damn. I love you too. Of course I do… Few more months go by. We’re progressing really well as a couple. Everything in sync, no actual fights just a few tiny arguments here and there about stuff we forget the next day. By now I know about her abusive parents. I’ve seen her body. I’ve seen the marks. Six month anniversary comes around. She writes me a letter. She tells me everything about last Christmas. I’m shaking with nothing to say… I just hold her and tell her I love her while she cries in my arms… I still feel as useless as possible. I still can’t do anything for her.

Few more months. We’re fooling around. By now we’ve had the “no sex till marriage” conversation. I didn’t have any plans of losing virginity any time soon, neither did she. But it happened anyway. It was totally unplanned, I honestly didn’t know what we were actually doing until we stopped… Fuck. I know I made a mistake. She knows she’s made a mistake. We’re both silent now. We go to the convenience store. Pop her a Morning After pill (which worked). Very little conversation between us at this point. I asked her if she was okay. She was. Me too. We enjoyed it, but it was much earlier than we both had thought. Now that we’ve had a taste of that we can’t stop. We’ve had sex nearly daily for the past two or so months. Obviously now with protection. 

At this point we’re at a month ago. She wants to tell my parents. I don’t give two shits about hers so it doesn’t matter if they know or not. She doesn’t either. But my parents are important… I know that they might not approve. But I love her. I do. What if they really don’t approve. Do I just break up with her? Do I defy my parents? They’ll kick me out. They won’t have any respect for me. I can’t have that. Is she that important to me? My mind is a mess. I’m conflicted in every possible way about this situation. I want to tell them, but the possibility of them not liking her and asking me to give her up was very real. I can’t tell them yet. So we don’t. It’s still a secret. She’s pretty upset with me but life goes on.

We’re at today now. Oh today is important isn’t it. My mind is again a mess. My parents have lost a bit of respect for me. They still trust me. They still see my influence on the kids. They still know I love them and I still know they love me. I’m still living here. They’re still paying for my college. I’m still living the same life… But my mind isn’t the same right now. I feel different. I know I’m not the same guy they had imagined I was. But it hasn’t hit me yet until today. I still want to be as close to that as possible. I owe it to them for everything they did for me. I want to do as much as I can for them. But I’m no longer that idea they had. We both faced reality today. And I don’t know who got punched in the face harder.

I don’t know what to do. I haven’t talked to my dad again today. He still wants me to break off sex and totally break up with her. She’s not even in the country right now, she’s with her aunt/uncle right now. I didn’t tell her yet. She doesn’t know. She’s about to soon, next week she’ll be back. I’ll tell her. We’ll have to talk.

I’ve only known her for a year now but she has absolutely been one of the most impactful people in my life. She’s so supportive and so caring of me and my sister. She is absolutely someone I can see myself with in the future. She’s not a slut. She’s not a whore. Yesterday if you asked me would I marry her I would have said yes almost instantly. Today that question just became 1000x harder to answer. One of my fears is her past… She hasn’t had any therapy, and no one but me and her other closest friend to talk to about that experience. But she’s told me many times over that I’ve helped her move on much more than anything else which could have happened. I can’t stand the thought of her doing something similar again if we do breakup.

So reddit… What are your opinions of my long, poorly written, comma spliced story? What am I to do. How do I proceed… My minds being torn apart by these two sides and I would really love to read some input… 

Thank you, even if you just read a bit. Thanks.

**TL;DR:** My parents found out I have a GF, which they hinted at me not ever getting. Oh and they also found out we have sex and they’re highly disappointed in me and blamed it on her for wanting to get money from my wealthy parents. Now they want us to breakup and I’m conflicted on what to do.

My mom and I live in the suburb with my dad. He does not allow us to drive his car. We don’t have one for ourselves. My mom has tried for years to have a career, but as an immigrant from India with basic working but not excellent English, outdated degree in zoology, and heavy distraction, discouragement, fear-inducing behavior from my father, never consistently held the few jobs she got. Until after he retired a few years ago. Now she works a job 2 miles from home, and he drives her. 3 miles is like the max he is willing to drive anyone anywhere for anything. She can’t use that money to buy a car because it has to be used for basic family/living expenses. 

I am a twenty something and I am trying to get a job but I am facing similar problems. My father thinks walking, biking, taxis, ride sharing services, public buses, driving rly cheap used cars/clunkers, small 2-person cars etc. are all unsafe. Maybe not walking if it’s half a mile in full day light. When he doesn’t want us to do something, he harasses the hell out of us to not do it, or scares us. If he is really scared for our safety, he may physically stop, but I’m not sure. I don’t feel like I have the street smarts to travel these ways safely anyway, I am too sheltered/naive. 

I want to move out, but can’t figure out how to get a job and travel there. I don’t live within 2 mile walking distance of a bus stop. I wish my mom would divorce and we could live together but I think she doesn’t believe it’s safe for her to divorce if she can’t survive on her own. 

He always claims it’s not his fault, he never stopped us, it’s our fault we don’t buy our own car, get our own jobs/careers, etc. He says other ppl come to this country with less and make it why can’t we. I’m not saying whether he is right or wrong, I’m just trying to do it. 

I graduated college with a bachelors degree in Econ and bio. My dad only prefers that I get a good high paying job and then lease a car when I get the job. I’m not having much luck with jobs. no one wants to hire someone with my qualifications and not many of those jobs exist near me anyway. Im resorting to anything now I guess even if I’m a cashier or something because what else can I do. I can’t afford to date and don’t know how old I will be once I am able to. Im a female and I’m scared of missing out on good guys and ending up with some abusive or narcissistic partner. But I also think if I get a good boyfriend he can help me escape. Once I make it I can help my mom. But I can’t date bc I don’t have transportation yet. I’m getting so emotionally tired and I can’t afford therapy and don’t know what to do anymore. My dad says it’s his life so long as he is alive, my life starts when he dies. And different variations of this he has said to me child age 5 to today.

Edit: if you comment, please be kind. My mental health is very poor and can’t handle rudeness. I have been victim blamed far too much, so please leave advice without blaming me.",2020.0,2.0,20.0,10:48:23,abuse

As I'm opening up more to the world and learning things, I'm realising the negative implications of the term are extremely negative, not to mention misrepresented. Even today people are using the term to justify genocide and extremist actions that I hate seeing. I find the association hurtful, but I don't exactly know how to deal with it.

Last year, I went to a therapist because of my anger outbursts at home, and he said I had ADHD, mild schizophrenia and could have bipolar disorder as well. My girlfriend at the time wasn't very supportive about that, and left me for someone else out of the blue around four months ago. We had gone out for four years. That didn't do me well, I started drinking a little more often, about once in three days. I smoke weed too, but never too much, around four times a week. 

My parents got worried and didn't know what to do, they took me to another doctor who gave me a bunch of meds, and revealed I had some mood disorder in addition to my other problems. I didn't have a problem with the meds tbh, but the breakup used to get to me, and the nights when it did, I didn't have anyone to talk to and I'd go out and have a drink or a joint, and I'd feel so much better and happier. As time went on, the drinks and joints lessened, and I was coping so much better. My parents didn't think so though, they'd find find the occasional empty bottle, or a loose OCB, and assume the worst. 

Fast forward to last Monday, they found a bit of weed in my cupboard and decided they've had enough. They took me to a mental health institute here and my mother asked me to sign a form of admission, telling me that everyone does to see the doctor, I don't know why I believed her, but I did. The doctors there told me I had a substance abuse problem, that somehow arose from my ADHD, and that I have to be admitted for a while. And so there lay, for three days, literally doing nothing but staring at four walls. The doctors would come everyday and tell me how weed will ruin your life, and that I'd have to sit and think about what I've done. 

My parents came and agreed to take me back home as long as I listened to exactly what they say. No phone, no contact with any friends, no going out, no Internet, and no college. And I have to be with my father the entire time, all of this for two whole months. I can't do that, I feel like my parents are being insanely unreasonable. Everytime I talk to my parents about how ridiculous this is, all I get back is how ridiculous I've been. I managed to get my phone back, I told them I need it to write, and I'm using my neighbours wifi. I really really want to get out. If they let me finish college, I could get a job and leave this place but they aren't letting me do that. They said if i dont listen, theyll have to forcefully put me back there. I don't know what to do. If anyone can help me or give me advice on what to do, it would be of great help. I live in India, so going to the cops is out of the question. Also I'm 21, so moving out is out of the question. I don't know where to go or anything but my chest feels heavy and my head keeps screaming out the longer I stay here.

I’m sorting through something messy, uncomfortable, and dirty af in regards to my life experiences and the current fire tire in America. I came to this conclusion, I do not identify with white privilege.

To quote a man adored by birds, “Let me be very clear,”…I am not refuting the existing of white privilege or that I have not been affected by it in some way, I’m saying that I don’t identify with it. In the literal sense, I do not have strong links to it.

To define white privilege as it has been taught to me- a position of power, a position of privilege, not being the center of attention, not taking up space, and defending the marginalized when a non-marginalized person is demeaning or threatening them.

As I was sifting through the chaos of these thoughts and trying to understand the conflict within me, I came across a comic from the Star Tribune: (http://68.media.tumblr.com/2dc6fce7f645f9e981a71dea7a40a723/tumblr_mq36j454y91r55d2io1_500.jpg)

The contrast is abundantly clear but provided me with the questions I needed. The questions I haven’t been able to put into words for the entirety of my life. What if there was another scenario?

What if there was a third “talk,” depicting a white parent pointing a gun at a white child?

If you want to understand what I mean in more detail, I was in a federal court in December. After 10 years, I was able to read a victim's impact statement for injustices against me that will never be served. Although, I did help solidify a lengthy sentence for his current crime by providing historical context. (https://www.advocatesrising.com/statements/2016/12/29/to-my-step-father-the-defendant)

If you have read that and are now back, I’m going to add more context to my background. I’m a white, bisexual, female. My descent is Norwegian. My great grandma came from Norway on a boat, when she was 16. I’m a first-time graduate and did so entirely independent of my pos parents. I was never talked to about college, and when the conversation occurred, I was told that it was unreachable for me. I thought I had to join the military to get a better education, so I did. My body did not approve. At some point, I ended up in community college and a university but was ashamed of myself the whole way. I never thought I belonged there. Before I turned 18, I had moved 33 times and went to 15 different schools, and –every-single-one-, lost my vaccine records. Yeah, I’ve been vaccinated beyond acceptable. Just like me, lost in the system. I’ve had around 25 different jobs, the first one at 16. I’ve been homeless. I’ve dug through trash to find cans/money for food. Now, at almost 30, I have achieved the “American Dream.” I have a home and a car, both achieved through a miraculous life insurance policy, (we weren’t related), two handsome boys with four legs, and a stable job. I’ve also achieved the “Millennial Dream,” constant subconscious dread about extensive student loans and the inability to rest in the search for a meaningful existence.

I’m going to go back a little further in time than in my statement. I won’t cover it all, just snippets. When I was seven, my mom, my brothers, and I were on the run from a different abusive “stepdad.” After traveling for only a little while, my mom realized he was following us. She went to the police for safety, but there was nothing they could do. She had no proof. From then on, my mom video recorded us while we slept to gather evidence. Eventually, we got him on camera, but he wasn’t alone. We watched the playback of him and two of his friends hovering over my brothers and I while we slept. My mom confident that would bring us protection took the footage to the police. It still wasn’t enough. They couldn’t see his face. Fearing for our safety, my mom abandoned everything we had left and took us to a women’s shelter. I remember vividly, that was my first memory of a poc. As I sat on my mom’s lap, I gazed across the room. A little girl of color sat on her mom’s lap. We both looked at each other for a long time. My only thought, I wonder if her daddy beats her, too.

My next encounter with a poc was when I was 8, Michael. An intelligent, charismatic Vietnamese boy who lived across the street. I was captivated by his love of oysters and respect for his family’s customs. I would’ve done anything for that kid, and when I could, I did. I gave up my elephant ride at the circus because he was so passionately fixated on it and when a classmate called him a g---k, I got my a---- beat by my white principal for going after him. Did the other kid get in trouble? Nope. A white person beat me because I lunged myself at a white kid and called him a cracker, and the kid who actually used derogatory language and insulted a poc, nothing.

When I was nine, I was invited into the home of my little brother’s doctor. It’s been too long to recall the specifics, but they were from India. They guided me through their extraordinary religious poses, taught me the significance of the paint they adorned on their bodies, and they allowed me to wear their beautifully ornamented outfits while dancing in a peacefully choreographed celebration, unique to their culture.
Between eight and fourteen, every school that I went to. Every time I was the new kid. I was instantly befriended by a poc. I’ve taken this to heart now that it’s because people of suffering recognize people of suffering. Through my teenage years, I kept close to Pamela and Betty who had no care for my hand me down clothes or that I lived in a trailer park. We lived there together. We stayed away from the violent gang activity together. We cried over Selena together. When my mom was wasted and abusive, they invited me to their home, and I got to experience every bit of what it means to have an extended, caring family.

It wasn’t until I was fourteen-eighteen that I was forced into what I now see as white privilege culture. Another move, forced by the pos my victims impact statement was for, to a small town. Every city I lived in before was predominately poc. Now, there was only one family of color. Thankfully, they lived across the street from me, and you bet, we became friends. I couldn’t handle being near the rest. As I sat in class listening to them about dating, college, shopping, vacations, cell phones, cars, and getting grounded over bad grades, declaring that I wanted to scream and vomit all over them, violently, is an understatement. I wished so desperately those were my only worries. I wondered what kind of life I could have, what my grades would be like.
Instead, I wondered what would happen when I went home. Would my mom be beaten to death? Would we have enough food to eat? Are my brothers and I getting separated again? If we did get separated, would we be forced to move back in with that pos, again? All for the sake of “Oklahoma family values.” Will I be able to walk home safely from work or will tonight be the night I get arrested for being out after curfew? Would that pos put a gun to my brother’s head and pull the trigger, this time? Will we have to move again, tomorrow? Was I going to make enough money to help pay rent or electricity? Was our house going to be set on fire?

Through typing all of this out, I’ve removed blinders off my white experiences. White people abused me. White people oppressed me. White people made me fear for my life, every day, constantly threatening me, taking every opportunity to tell me I’m worthless and that I should kill myself. White people tried to kill me. It is has been exceedingly rare for a white person to sit with me in my pain and discomfort, then or now. (Obviously, this excludes my wife). White people called me a liar, and they still do. White people told me I was going to hell for loving a woman. White people said I was overreacting and making up lies because I couldn’t actually appreciate my life as a gift. White people told me that if I would just accept what was happening, that if I stopped fighting, everything would be okay. White people feel comfortable touching me without my permission. White people force me to accept their narrative. White people ostracize me for speaking the truth.

So where does that leave me? With a severe psychological disorder, PTSD, among many other physical fear responses I can’t control. I’m working on them, though. It’s only been in the last few years that I have reached the point of not sleeping in my clothes for safety, and not locking the doors repeatedly every time I wake up from night terrors. Working on my interactions with people has only been a possibility within the last year, and that last pos”stepdad” had to harm more innocent kids last year, throwing me back into all that trauma all over again. Even further, when I tried to get involved in the case to help, a white person had the audacity to ask me “what good I thought it would do now to come forward” and a white lawyer defended that pos’s right to a reduced sentence out of safety concerns, and requested him to be relocated to a safer prison. You know who was there for me with all of this? A police officer of color. That same police officer of color took my statement of what happened 10 years ago, after finding out that small town police department shredded my first statement. They shredded it two years before my statute of limitations was up. Even further, it was that police officer of color who walked me through all of the evidence on my mom wanting to abandon me for that pos. It was that police officer of color who offered me support from that point forward.

Over the last 10 years, I haven’t been involved with people at all. It’s agonizingly challenging for me to be around people. One of my greatest endeavors of the last year is becoming friends with a group of like-minded people, who were inspired by a man adored by birds. Two happen to be poc that I admire, greatly. When I met them, I didn’t think they were equal to me. I thought they were better than me. Smarter than me. More caring and intellectual than me. Here I was, barely feeling like I deserved to get an associates degree, and they’re getting their Ph.D.! Herein lies the overall problem, I don't remember to think of myself as a person with white privilege because I barely remember to think of myself as a person of worth.

Without them realizing it, every interaction I have with poc empowers me. The confidence I wish to aspire to, I hear in every speech given. In their writings, their work, in their movies, their art, at a rally, a protest, or a solidarity march. Their natural, authentic self, speaking with boldness, conviction, and truth. That’s who I want to be. That is who I look up to.

I want to help. I want to say, “Those people hurting you are not my family. Those people hurting you are not my country. You are important. You are equal. You are my peer. You are my confidant. You are intelligent. Your life is worth it. You are worth it. You are beautiful. You are brave. You belong here. You are home. You are my family. You are my country. You are my diversity. You are my unity. You are my vision for the future. You are my definition of love. You are my strength. You may not realize it, but you are every bit an ally for me, as I am for you. For these reasons, I would sacrifice my life to protect you and so much more.” 

To the main point of this piece. This year, 2017, is the first year I have given myself permission stop shaming myself, to take space, to consider my life is worthy, work with my PTSD and get involved, have friends, not be afraid, and just be myself. Whoever the hell that is. I'm trying to learn how to exist and talk about abuse and love people and validate them for who they are. That's my skill set.

When I interact with other people, I sift through several filters. First and foremost, abuse. In what way is this person feeling hurt, fear, anger, sadness, and/or oppression? The second, how is this affecting them in who they are: sexism, racism, misogyny? This doesn’t include my own layers, does this person even want to talk to me? Why are they talking to me? What exactly do I have to offer them?

If my first filter is supposed to be white privilege, that means I would have to think of myself first, and I don’t know how to do that. I’ve never done that. I don’t know if I want to do that because it’s not about me.

These are the questions I’ve come to: 
• White people abused me, oppressed me, ignored me, and didn’t protect me. Does my abuse by white people mean less because I’m white? 
• I’ve never belonged or been able to take space at the white table, now that our culture is awakening to the explanation of privilege, I can no longer sit a poc table. Where do I go? 
• After being brought up in terror and programmed as worthless, do I now have worth and power from an entire group of people, because externally it appears that I belong to this s**t system? 
• Where does my abuse and oppression end and my power begin? • What if I never had power and I don’t know what that looks like outside of abuse or how I can obtain it?

Not everyone wants to deny. Not everyone lives in comfort. Not everyone is on that far end of the spectrum. Some of us want to help and have no idea how to get there. If I hold capacity for a poc to lash out against me because of the cruelty in this hellish world and somehow manage to deny the psychological fear/ hijacking of my mind, can a poc have capacity for me? Not just call me out, but show me exactly what I can do to obtain that power and not dehumanize me in the process?

4,36,Should I take up the household expenses of my family home or go live separately and probably risk alienating my father?,1.0,5mlv9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5mlv9x/should_i_take_up_the_household_expenses_of_my/,3.0,1483842146.0,"A little background. I (M/30) am from India. I am living with my family which is usual here. I have been paying my share of expenses for a few years now. I dropped out of a professional course last year which resulted in years of wasted study time. I earn low income working online, just enough to cover my household expenses, personal expenses and some amount towards investment. I am looking to start a business but I am scared to make the leap.

My father is asking me to shoulder all of the household expenses (which would be around the same amount I earn each month) or get out of the house. It is his house so he can do that. He has retired but is otherwise capable of working and is working on his personal projects.

My mother is trying to shield me from this. Firstly because I am her son and she wants to keep me in a cocoon, which I completely dislike.  She also hates my father due to his abusive nature towards her and me (a little). This is a reason I share with her and I don't like helping my father in any way.

If I go to live on my own it would be as an growing up / adventure type of thing for me. But my father is very likely to interpret it as if I have forsaken my family as I would be choosing to live alone instead of paying the expenses at home.

What should I do:

Pay the money at home? If yes, then how much (as % of total household expenses)?

Or

Go live on my own and risk alienating my family and still end up paying a similar amount (because of added rent and duplicate expenses)?

EDIT 1 : In our culture it is common for parents to support children for some time after they turn 18. My father did the bare minimum till I turned 18 and I have been earning and studying and taking care of my personal expenses since then. It is also expected for children to support their parents when they retire. So if I go to live alone when given a choice to pay and stay, it would be bad from the societal point of view.

It is important to note that my father spent considerable amount on my younger sister (F/24) for her education, mobiles, a 2 wheeler and all other expenses (which are considerably higher than mine) while he did only the minimum for me and I was expected to and did buy all these on my own. But now that she has completed her education and is earning considerably more than me, I am expected to full bear the household expenses while my father specifically said that he will not be taking money from my sister not now, not ever, never. This partiality pisses me off because I sacrificed a lot when we I was a child and we did not have money. But when we did have money it all went to my sister.",2017.0,1.0,8.0,08:07:26,abuse
5,37,Really need help dealing with suspected mental illness with father. He is tearing our family apart it is really affecting my mother. I don't know of what to do anymore,6.0,2vy2o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2vy2o1/really_need_help_dealing_with_suspected_mental/,6.0,1424005660.0,"

Hello. I don't really need to know know where to start with this. Ok so let me give you a brief overview of our situation. My mom and dad came to America from India in the late 80's. They had an arranged marriage and only knew each other for only days before being married. They have never really had a loving relationship. He has always had issues with family. His side of family mostly suck horrible. His father is a terrible manipulative asshole. I'm sure my dad did not have a great upbringing. Over the years he has been betrayed in some way by most of his siblings and uncles. They have stolen from him. Had big arguments. Been kicked out, and manipulated by them when he first came to America.  So he definitely has trust issues.

While me and my brother where growing up he always had temper issues over stupid little things he would flip out on. He never physical abused us or anything. Only a smack or something once in awhile for misbehaving. He does love me and my brother very much and does care for us greatly. But he treats my mom pretty bad from an emotional standpoint. He usually isn't physical abusive to her either. Once in awhile he totally loses control.

Usually he is pretty nice. We never really bonded with him growing up. He works really hard everyday and has provided greatly for us. He took a small lotto store and turned it into a great business. Enough to live a very comfortable life and pay for pretty expensive colleges for both me and my bro. But alot of times we look at relationships our cousins and friends have with their dad's and feel saddened. I don't wanna say he isn't there for us, if we ever have a problem he will do his best to be there. (ex whole I was growing up I had Lyme disease and it greatly affected him. He would cry and take time off work to take me to various doctors. Wake up in the middle of the night and just cry. ) but would not show up to things like plays, school events, sports and stuff(he would try but always get tied up at work). We don't really have a father son relationship. We don't talk all too much when we are home and he doesn't really have a relationship with my mother, but it seems like he cares about her too(though he hardly ever shows it)

My mom is the nicest most loving awesome person in the world. She is always there for us emotional. But over the years my father's nature has broken her down. But she is a very strong woman. Lately she has been telling my and my bro that she doesn't know how much more she can take tho 

Basically the problem is that he has these insane mood swings. Something will tick him off, usually something stupid and small. He latches onto it and acts very irritable and angry. Usually during this time some huge argument happens that causes lots of problems. Lately the igniting point has been my mother's family. They came here from India in 2008. As I mentioned he has trust issues with family. My mom's side of the family is very nice. They are awesome caring people who have put up with my dads crap for years. But sometimes they can do something that pisses him off (ex last summer we bought a house and we where moving. My one uncle got home from work and stopped by while we where packing. He didn't offer to help, since he just got off work. My dad exploded and started a huge fight with me and my mom about it. I actually had to hold him down at one point. This grudge lasted for a few weeks and them we finally convinced him that he was wrong and he apologized) this example has happened alot over the years, starting from something small. Other times it has to do with mom at work and he flips out at my mom for something stupid like misplaced paperwork. These angry moods last a few weeks them he feels bad and apologies and is happy go lucky and nice for a few months. This usually happens once or twice a year. Sometimes more. 

But lately it's been happening more frequently. People can only take so much, you know? And it is really taxing my mother. She has been having anxiety attacks and stress problems now.  My uncle who runs one of my dads lottery stores is thinking of quitting over my dads latest episode. Currently he won't talk to any of them. One thing I didn't mention yet is that my dad always thinks he is right when he gets into these moods. And when we try to show him how ridiculous he is acting he gets defensive and gets upset saying we are always going against him. That is currently happening and I can't take it anymore. I don't know what to do. It's affecting my school work and I'm having trouble sleeping. We want to bring this up with someone and get him help. I think that getting him to a therapist would help us talk these issues over. The main reason I am writing this is out of concern for my mom. I am really worried about her. She is acting depressed and sad alot.  I want to stop this and figure out how to help my dad b/c we do love him very much. 

Sorry for the novel. I didn't even include all of the issues ugh. Basically we believe he has some kind of mental illness(bi polar or something). I made a meeting with a counselor at school. Other than that I don't know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",2015.0,2.0,15.0,18:52:40,abuse

Perhaps the biggest change that I have felt after growing up is coming in hands with reality. 


My family was pretty conservative but they never forced it onto me. Both my maternal and paternal relatives are socially conservative. 

My maternal grandfather was a doctor and was well off. He was posted as CMHO in a small town in Rajasthan, almost a village. 
Zee News had just started as a small news channel and my mom got an offer to work as an anchor there, very lucrative indeed. But for that she would have had to go out of town (maybe even state, I don't know for sure) for some sort of training and for that reason my Nanaji didn't let her go. She didn't question either. As a child she wanted to study Science  and become a doctor just like her father but then again my Nanaji didn't let her because she would have had to commute daily to a different town as at that time there was no school which taught science in the town. Two years later he got transferred to another town which did have schools teaching science and both of my uncles took onto studying science even though one was barely passing. My mother on the otherhand was stranded in a useless course of social science and later took onto doing a PhD in political science. Pretty useless. 



My dad on the other hand came from a very economically constricted family. They lived in a very small village barely scraping by with daily needs. He always had a knack for studying or so I am told. He left his village at the age of 16 and came to the city of Sikar to study further. Apparently his life was full of struggles where his father didn't want him to study but instead work as unskilled labour. I would not go into much detail but the family situation was indeed fucked up. When he was giving his civil service exams his mom got sick and had to undergo a life threatening surgery, the family, of course, couldn't afford it so he gave up all the scholarship money he had been saving, asked for loans from friends and got her operated one day before his exam. He did get selected though but not the post he wanted, I won't reveal what post he is on because I want to stay anonymous. But even after that the family situation didn't get better. He was forced into a marriage even though all he used to earn was 3K a month during his training period to feed a family of 8 siblings and two parents where the father smoked weed and did nothing to provide for his family. 



My parents' marriage wasn't very ideal to say the least, they had constant falling aparts, confrontations with family where apparently my father's family wanted dowry but my father refused to ask for it and then my mother was constantly nagged about it. My Nanaji helped them a great deal financially when he was in training though. My mother was a professor in a small college but my family didn't like that at all. 



All this paints a picture of a very conservative family but somehow I never had such confrontations. I was an only child and was kept far away from all this. It is surprising how my father who had an entire life of living in this environment managed to keep me away from it and also from himself. I always used to think the world is an ideal place where being good to each other is the norm except a few nutcracks here and there who created a divide. I went to a very expensive school and never realized that there is a difference between a Christian, a Muslim or a Hindu. Never did I ever think of women as 'women'. It is probably hard to imagine what I am trying to say. It was like there was no difference between a woman and a man or between a Hindu or a Muslim, they are all the same. But as I joined coaching insititutes I soon came to realization that a penis can create a seperation I had never seen. That someone's faith can change so much about a person's character. Sometimes when coming back home the Auto Rickshaw driver would ask me my surname and it sounds pretty cringy but I don't really have one. My parents decided that it will be better I just had a two worded name and not adopt their surname because we were of a lower caste. So when I would tell the driver my second name, he would get a little confused and ask me if I were of this x caste and I would not know the answer. Soon I came to know which caste I belong to and the next time the Ola driver asked me, I told him quite normally that I am a Kumhar. And it was so astonishing and degrading that his attitude changed so drastically, as if I am some lower form of being. 



It was so surreal and unbelievable. Once my dad had a cook who had a hairstyle which resembled Shah Rukh Khan's and when I told him about it I thought he would see it as a compliment but instead he felt offended and said, ""Mujhe us mulle se compare karega kya?"" 


All this was talks of stories and movies for me and as a 16 year old when I realized that all this is real I felt very disfranchized. 


My dad had a Muslim friend who is into some pretty shady business as I recently learned but as a child I was so verbose with him. Every Diwali he would carry me on his shoulders into Aatish market and buy me a shit ton of crackers. But now I cannot see him the same anymore. I cannot see him just as a person. There is this identity that I have subconsciously associated with him that yes he's a Muslim. When I heard about the stone pelters of Kashmir I thought ""Okay, yeah these guys suck."" but now I see them as ""Okay, yeah those Muslim guys suck."" 


Everything could have been so much better if there wasn't this identity associated with them. Why cannot everyone just be humans? This realization to reality has corrupted me, perhaps ignorance is bliss, yes it is. Now whenever I read someone's name, I first and foremost link them with their religion, caste, sex and create a prejudiced mental image. 


Now I have to tell myself proactively that all religions are equal, are sexes and genders are equal, everyone is a human being, a person's character is defined by his work and not the name he was born with. But earlier I didn't have to, it came inherited, I didn't have to proactively tell myself otherwise. 


When we teach ourselves, our younger siblings, cousins, children that everyone is equal and their social identity doesn't matter we also teach them that deep down it does. It does matter and that is why we are taught otherwise. We have to constantly run a check that his religion doesn't matter, their sex doesn't matter, their caste doesn't matter because it doesn't come inherently. It teaches us that there is something inherently wrong with our society and we are part of the problem which is why we have to force ourselves to not be when instead all we should have been taught is that everyone is human and so are you. 



A similar situation is narrated by GoT actress Maisie Williams that when she was told about femenism, she was startled to know that there has to be a construct where women are given equal rights, that a person will be labeled as a femenist when they fight for so. That being a feminist is a unique label when it should be a normal person and a sexist. 




As a kid I was proud of our society that it is so diverse and intertwined, but I am not sure if I can say that anymore. 



And unfortunately, I am perhaps forever stuck in this web where I have to tell myself to be humane.",2020.0,2.0,20.0,17:01:04,dowry

They blow most of their life savings on fulfilling the *unfair demands/dowry etc* by the boy's family. Some of them would end up in huge debts because of such expenses.

How can a guy with any **self respect** can demand upfront token(money etc) from the girl's family ? And most frustrating part, why a girl's family will ever accept such demands ? Shouldn't that be a huge red flag for them ?

Both of our mothers are putting a strain on our interracial, interfaith wedding plans.",110.0,2qy6g2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2qy6g2/me_26f_with_my_fiancé_26m_engaged_4_months_both/,70.0,1420086200.0,"My [26F] fiancé Pavan [26M] and I have been together for 14 years. We met in 6th grade, where we quickly became best friends. The summer between 6th and 7th grade he confessed that he liked me ""not like a *girl* *friend*, like a *girlfriend*"". It took me a few weeks to come around to the idea. When I told him that I thought I liked him too, he grinned ear to ear and bought me an ice cream sandwich. We’ve been madly in love ever since. 


We agreed in our teens that we did not want to rush into marriage, though both sides of our families are accustomed to get hitched fairly young. We made this abundantly clear to friends and family who initially were supportive, but began to apply more and more pressure as the years went on. So this past August (after both graduating college and being firmly established in our careers) for the 14th anniversary of our proclaimed like-likeness, Pavan popped the question. Four months into our engagement, and our mothers are making our wedding planning a huge headache.  


Pavan’s family is from India. His parents were born there, but he was born in the States. They are devout Hindus and happen to be the kindest people I’ve ever met. The whole family is deeply connected with the fairly large local Indian community and strive to maintain and promote their beautiful culture and traditions. Typically, it’s really frowned upon to date someone who isn’t Indian.  For that reason, Pavan and I tried to keep our relationship a secret from them, and said we were just friends. They knew better. At 15 or 16 his mother asked me to come into the kitchen with her and she animatedly began teaching me an Indian recipe. When I asked her why, she said “It’s Pavan’s favorite. A wife should know” and winked at me. Since then I’ve been embraced not only by his family, but by the majority of their community as well.


My family is Puerto Rican, and my siblings and I were all born on the island but came to the mainland as small children. My family is fairly Americanized, and don’t blink an eye at an interracial relationship. Because we were attached at the hip for nearly all of middle school, my parents weren’t shocked to hear that Pavan was my boyfriend (though I doubt they could have imagined he would continue to be my boyfriend for another decade and a half.) Pavan has always been extremely polite and the very definition of a gentleman, so naturally my parents adored him. He even studied Spanish in high school and college in order to better communicate with them. It’s also important to note that my parents are also “convenient” Catholics who are not shy about sharing their opinions (though never in an offensive or overbearing way.) 


After announcing our engagement we were flooded with congratulations (and several “about time!”s) from all sides. Not to mention all the comments about what lovely brown babies we will have. We were able to bask in the glow of love and support for about a week before the calls started coming. Apparently, both sets of parents (namely both of our mothers) felt that there was no time to waste and encouraged us to immediately begin to plan the wedding. Or rather, allow them to start planning the wedding. Here’s where it got interesting.


Pavan’s mother wants a traditional Hindu ceremony, spanning at least three full days. Among the planned festivities would be lots of temple visits with prayer and sacrificial offerings, a full parade down the street of my parents’ home, several “giving the bride away” and dowry rituals performed by my male relatives, and a number of symbolic rituals that involve fire, all officiated by a Hindu priest. Her vision includes elaborately embroidered saris, fingertip to shoulder and toe to calf mehndi (henna), lots of gold and jewels, floor to ceiling decorations, endless buffets of Indian cuisine and a guest list that includes nearly 500 people.  Not to mention the expectation that my parents will pony up the cash for the majority of it.


My mother of course wants a traditional Catholic ceremony with lots of Puerto Rican influence. She wants my childhood priest to officiate at their church. Her ideal wedding includes mass, several scripture readings, a homily, and communion - all in Spanish of course! I’m to be dressed in a flowing white ball gown with a bouquet of orchids.  My father will walk me down the aisle and place my hand into Pavan's to officially ""give me away."" And a huge reception with traditional Puerto Rican dishes and a towering coconut rum cake topped with a doll made in my likeness. Her guest list seems modest in comparison, a mere 250 of our (read: *her*) closest friends and family. And while it’s traditional for the bride’s parents to pick up the tab for the ceremony and reception, they expect Pavan’s parents to pay for our honeymoon (to where else but Puerto Rico.)


While Pavan and I are both atheists, we acknowledge that it is difficult (if not impossible) to divorce our cultural heritages from the religions we were raised to believe in. And while we embrace and celebrate our own and each other’s ethnicity and culture, we are adamantly opposed to rituals that imply that a woman is property to be exchanged into a marriage. All that said, we are wholly unprepared to plan a wedding that equally represents our races, beliefs, and desires without seeming to prefer one side of the family over the other. We’ve tried to envision a perfect union of the two cultures, but it just doesn’t come together. My mother in a sari. His father dancing to bachata. My aunt digging into a curry. His grandmother taking communion. Sanskrit mantras. Spanish vows. Our worlds have never felt further apart. Our mothers are insistent that plans start to be made, but we have no idea where to even begin.  How can we navigate through this and create a wedding that is meaningful to us and our families? 

**EDIT**: Wow, thanks for all the great advice and well wishes.  A lot of folks have been asking about the budget and how much our families will be contributing.  The answer is that we honestly don't know yet. Because we don't know what we want the wedding to be, we have yet to have a conversation with our folks about money.  Both our folks live very comfortably, (we do ok as well) so as long as we keep the plans within reason it shouldn't be a burden on anyone financially. Pavan and I plan to sit down today and make our wedding wish lists.  We'll compare the two, then plan to ask both sets of parents over for dinner in a few days to discuss our wants and hopefully find a good balance that will make everyone happy. Fingers crossed!

&#x200B;

We're Fucked. It's not news but still, we're fucked. My feelings like this start with my life long disgust of Indian roads. Anyway, looking into a more serious thing like not a single rape case has been given justice in this country for the time I can remember. Everyone just sucks related to the justice system ( or just people in general?). We worship women Devi a few times a year and the rest of the year they are just slaves of our own making. Are they still just objects of men's world? Heck, even women in power act like Indian men. Terrifying, isn't it?

What kills me inside when the rapists escape the punishment. Police don't take FIR. Forensic/CSI reports don't get submitted. Judge fucking says ridiculous bullshit, bow to power. Rape victim family and witness gets killed by accident before the hearing. Who are these people we vote, we elect, we kill our countrymen on the other sides for?

If hearing a rape news one's blood doesn't boil, that person is not OK. Mentally.

&#x200B;

Comedians becomes journalists.

Journalist becomes \_undefined.

Roads are still shit.

Healthcare is non-existent.

Air Quality is fucked.

Life expectancy is far below expected.

What is Mental Health?

(1+ out of every 10 people is mentally troubled.)

The justice system is fucked.

Taxing, Banking is for Capitalists. It's a mechanism built for sucking poor people dry.

The new is Old Joomlas. With various flavors of biryani or momo.

Media is spineless, corrupt and run by bastards.

Farmers are dying of poverty and decades of neglect.

Everything we eat is with preservatives, pesticides or chemicals.

99% of Indian people don't understand the personal space, privacy of other people at all.

(just get self-conscious for a moment in public lines and get ready to feel weird how close people to you)

Sexual Abuse is just as infectious as new Corona-virus here.

Religion is alright but Religiousness = madness.

97% percent of Indians are sexually frustrated. It's a national problem none want to talk about.

276+ million people in India are below the poverty level. The near-total population of the USA.

Dalits are treated as Dirt.

Sex is not a verb or noun it's a mindset of India.

( How the fuck this country has more population than a few world Continents combined. This proves how suppressed we are to teach and talk to our population about this ancient secret method of reproduction here like area 51)

&#x200B;

Privacy is a joke.

( Last night one fucking chemist just took my prescription photo in his phone, which I just realized how the fuck is this normal? Why I didn't say anything! ) As these little things, we got used to are not normal. I got asked by an HDFC banker to login to my account in his office PC just so he can check some things. Like hell this is normal. What the fuck is wrong with us? Why we're like this, a bunch of peeping toms?

&#x200B;

Apparently, all we worry about is Ram Mandir, Pakistan, Muslims, Momo, Biryani, Joomlas, Babas, Bollywood, Movie Actors and British looted us.

It's fucking 70+ years of Independence, we couldn't make roads properly yet. All media does is make cancerous news headlines and spread communal violence.

&#x200B;

How can we tolerate this for so long? Are you just going out of the country just when you think you can't take it anymore? Are we just pretending to be blind, deaf and brainless when people like Patra and other mambas spray venom all over?

How can we watch these TV channels just doing what they do everyday things like publicly shouting curses, insults, racism, discrimination, lie, polarize and million other cancerous things?

&#x200B;

When was the last time you thought I like this city, town, village, peoples, nature, air, water, schools, transport, your local river, local produce, asked you kids ( IT  specially) are you happy in school, the college the course you're doing, are you happy son/daughter?

When my head won't feel ashamed a foreigner comes to our country cleans the road and we won't laugh at them?

&#x200B;

I'm not ok man. I'm not OK.

Maybe you're not ok too, maybe a slight.

it's alright, you have a life I know.

&#x200B;

Not like me wasting life sitting in my chair. I wish you never feel bad for yourself, but still shouldn't we all. The clusterfuck of the mess we're running in loops. It is what it is, the country we live in today. All due respect to Mahatma Gandhi, he should've taught more action than toleration. It seems nothing is sufficient enough to fight this cancer of these clusterfucks and unfuck ourselves in this modern times.

&#x200B;

Edit: Whoa! Gold & Silver for a rant. Thank you kind friends.

* We will analyze and use the data to publish the list of suspected rapists. If anyone feels that a rapist is missing in the list, you can anonymously get them added.

* The police will thereafter arrest all suspected rapists and due process will be followed in the court of law. It is upto the rapist to prove otherwise.

* The Government understands that women may have problems due to them being victims of rapes more often. Hence special fast track courts would be set up to provide them justice. Here we will assume their innocence unless proven otherwise.

* Some anti-women groups would call the above as specifically calling all men rapists. It is not. It is just providing quick access to justice to women.

I asked her to stop and now she's mad.,0.0,enz38i,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/enz38i/my18m_gf20f_is_always_talking_about_things_i_dont/,9.0,1578918123.0,"I am an engineering student and my gf studies law in the same university. She is a senior of mine and we generally get on pretty well. She is kind, considerate and always goes the extra mile.

However, she is extremely passionate about law and spends time reading articles and papers on Jurisprudence, legal developments in India and Laws on crimes against Women. She always discusses this with me, including her plans on what to do after law school (she wants to be a litigator). 

All this is fine, but when we are just laying in bed she keeps on talking about legal principles and laws and I don't understand most of it. I hinted that I would like to have other conversations but she can't take a hint (she has said this herself... ""Tell me directly , I don't want to spend my time picking up on hints"") 

So yesterday I got really annoyed and told her to just stop repeating herself about domestic violence laws and rape laws because it's just super annoying. She went silent for sometime. After an hour she comes up to me and says "" I know you don't understand much of what I am saying, it's not something you study or are passionate about. But I am considerate and when you constantly talk about engineering... Which I don't understand or appreciate, I always listen. Even when you have said the same thing multiple times or told me a story multiple times. I expected the same from you. I won't talk about law anymore. ""

Now, this is true. She does always listen. I thought it was because she found it interesting. But if it annoys her so much, she should have just told me to stop. I would have appreciated it. I told her this, she just smiles and says ""I don't find it annoying, I just find it hurtful that our expectations of each other don't match. ""

She's making me feel like I am unreasonable, yet I feel like the fault is on her. I don't know, I need advice. How to I approach this topic and am I being the asshole? 

TlDR: GF always talks about law, I asked her to stop. Now she's hurt and says that she would do for me what I wouldn't for her. Am I the unreasonable one?",2020.0,1.0,13.0,18:07:03,rape

### Highlights

* **Background:**  In a public interest litigation filed by the Justice for Rights Foundation in the Delhi High Court, a plea was made for separate guidelines to regulate content on online streaming platforms. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) informed the Court that the Information Technology Act is a robust enough legislation. On February 8, 2019, the High Court agreed with this submission and dismissed this PIL. 
* **Industry proposes Self-Regulation:** In January 2019 at the India Digital Summit in New Delhi, the Internet and Mobile Associations of India (IAMAI) along with some prominent online video streaming companies created a code for self-regulation. As per press reports this has been presented to MEITY and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) for endorsement. We have in the past cited concern on this measure. 
* **Giving credit where it is due:** We wrote to MEITY appreciating the position it took in affirming the sufficiency of the Information Technology Act for online video content streaming even though some provisions within it require reform. We have also called on for additional steps including seeking a correction of the order (given it cites the non-existent Section 66A) and asking a copy of it to be furnished in similar public interest litigations. 

### Background

Three interesting events have taken place bringing us to this particular intersection. 

*One:* On October 11, 2018 a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed by the Justice for Rights Foundation in the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi (W.P. (C) 1164/2018) requesting the Court for guidelines on regulating certain kinds of content on the online platform. This included web based shows such as Sacred Games, Game of Thrones etc., for vulgarity, pornography, abusive language, as you can imagine, the list goes on. This is not limited to certain adult-based content but even the use of the phrase 'Holy Cow' in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ([Read the PIL here](https://barandbench.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Delhi-HC-Netflix-Amazon-online-shows-Petition.pdf)).

*Two:* On January 16, 2019, the Economic Times reported an agreement among certain companies and the IAMAI on a code for the self-regulation by online content providers. We explained the deterrent effect this would have on your online viewing experience ([Read here for more](https://internetfreedom.in/we-urge-a-rethink-on-the-proposed-self-censorship-for-video-streaming-platforms/)). 

*Three*: On February 8, 2019, a division bench of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court consisting of the Hon'ble Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Hon'ble Justice V. Kameswar Rao delivered a verdict on the PIL filed by Justice for Rights Foundation dismissing the petition. This was possible largely due to the positive submissions by MIB and MEITY. 

### Appreciation with a side of caution

The Hon'ble Court affirmed that while there is no separate provision for regulating online content, the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 were not only merely applicable but an adequately armed with Section 69 to block illegal content. It also contains an entire chapter of offences which can take care of illegal content. While we are concerned with some of them, this is an incremental victory. It prevents a heavy, licensing style system from emerging in the video streaming space which would threaten our viewing choices online. 

A large part of this result is due to the submissions of both the MIB and MEITY which pointed that there is no need for further guidelines when sufficiently stringent provisions are already in existence. Agreeing with them, the Hon'ble Court instructed that if the petitioner continued to consider content provided on certain platforms prohibitory, it should take it up with the relevant statutory authority. That's legal for 'tough luck'. You can find the order of the Court [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W7g9fLcgG8vYBJuDag0NQY-OZru1npo6/view?usp=sharing).

This is a positive outcome due to the submissions made by two government ministries. We have called on them to cement this with taking the following actions: 

* **Incorrect reference to Section 66A:** The Hon'ble Court order has referred to Section 66A of the Information Technology Act which was struck down as unconstitutional. Here  government ministries should ideally approach the Court and request for a correction of this error. 
* **Utilise the Order:** After such an application has been made and a corrected order is available it may be used in similar PILs which are pending in different courts over India. This will prevent any inconsistency and help maintain our online freedoms. 
* **Avoid according sanction to the self-censorship code:**If the IAMAI Self-Regulation Code for online video streaming platforms was to receive validation, it would result in it being accepted as an industry-wide norm. Cut to, the pre-censorship of your favourite shows. This would defeat the very beauty that lies in the uninhibited nature of online viewing content. Your shows would just be one magnificent 'bleep' like *Udta Punjab* and its 94 cuts. It is for this reason we urge both MIB and MEITY to maintain its position which it took in this case. 

We will be sending a letter for these follow up actions and also seeking a meeting with their offices. You can find our letter to MIB and MEITY [at this link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16ce4AZnFeya06YZm-qSLPhNTPlzVlWwlWljEhEMEUNc).

28,158,[Serious] A student committed suicide after mental and physical torture from Engineering college authorities in Kerala.,352.0,5mybd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5mybd4/serious_a_student_committed_suicide_after_mental/,120.0,1484005229.0,"This incident happened four days ago, but you are unlikely to read about this in the news because the college's owner have heavy political influence. Any negative news about this college almost never comes out of the campus as any student who dares to report such things will immediately be suspended/debarred/not-allowed-to-write-exams.

The last time a negative news came from this engineering college was in 2010 when some students protested because two college officials(male) went inside ladies hostel at night and misbehaved with girls. The officials claimed that they were going through the bags of all girls to inspect if anyone have brought any mobile phones or laptops. Yes, phones are banned in this Engineering college. The students who protested the next day were debarred! After this incident, no one dares to protest no matter what happens.

I am an ex-student of this college and I can confirm that everyday was like going to hell. It is a private college-network. They run multiple colleges under different names at different locations (Nehru College of Engineering and Research Center, Thrissur, Kerala, Jawaharlal college of Engineering, Palakkad,Kerala, Nehru colleges, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu etc) The college where this incident happened is **Nehru College of Engineering and Research Center, Thrissur, Kerala**.

For most people, college life might be the most enjoyable time of their life, but not for me or any of my classmates. It was a mental torture to go through this college. I am glad that it is over now. I can mention some of my 'memories' of my college life

1. You are not allowed to talk to anyone of the opposite gender. If you talk and any ""disciplinary inspectors"" sees it, then they will consider it to be romance/love, you will be suspended immediately and your parents will be called. If you are lucky, you can get away with a fine and few weeks suspension.

2. You are not allowed to share benches with a person of opposite gender. It is in the rule book!

3. We have uniforms and Id cards. If you are caught with even a one-day's worth of beard, your ID card will be snatched and you will have to pay fine of Rs100 to Rs500. If you are caught without the ID cards next day, you will have to pay more fine. These fines are not really meant to make students better, but they are just collecting the fines for the sake of making free money. Considering atleast 100 students getting Rs100 fine per day on average, they are getting atleast 2.5 lakhs in fine every month. I doubt if they are submitting this data to the income tax department!

4. Compulsory attendance. Even if they do not teach anything for the whole day, you are forced to sit on the bench quietly, everyday. Leaves are not allowed unless you are very ill and can prove it with medical certificate. Taking a day off for any other reason will result in Rs100 fine(per day) and a meeting with the director. Attendance is taken every hour and if you miss even one class an automated sms will go to your parents, half day's attendance will be cut and you will be fined.

5. If they do not like you for any reason and they are unable to directly take action, forget your internals. They can fail you in every retest too, as it is totally under their discretion.

6. It is 6 days class every week from 9 to 4:30PM. Second & fourth Saturday are gladly holidays, but you will be given assignment on every second friday(and fourth friday) to write CMA. Full form is something like Chairman's Memorial Assessment or something like that. It was started when our founding chairman passed away few years ago. In CMA, you will be given five big questions of each subject, and you are supposed to write article sized answers in different booklets(which you need to buy from them) for each subject and this needs to be submitted by Monday 9:00AM in person. For any reason you are unable to come at that time, your internal marks is gone. These questions are nothing useful or creative. They just give ""explain xyz"" and you are supposed to find it in the textbook and copy it. Every second saturday and fourth saturday it is a ritual for everyone to circle-copy these things. Many professors have said that this is a waste of time but management is not allowing them to change this even if they want to.

7. If for some reason one day you got an unexpected holiday like due to a strike or something, dont think that you got a holiday as they will convert next real holiday into working day to compensate this unexpected holiday.

8. You are not allowed to bring 'outside books' to college. You must use the book made by the college only.

9. There are cctv cameras everywhere watching your every step.(This can be considered as good or bad..I dont know.)

10. Hostel is compulsory in first year for anyone who is not coming from their own home. Hostel life is way too strict too. I don't know how it is in other colleges, but we had roll-call every day just like prison camps. You are supposed to stand in a line at fixed time every day, and they will ask to say out loud your hostel roll number. Hostel curfew is at 6.30PM. Hostlers can go out of the campus with the written permission of the warden inbetween 4:30 to 6:30. Most hostlers do not get this permission and is hence trapped inside the campus full-time until the next holidays when they can go to their own home. Mess food is compulsory for hostlers, although the quality of food is poor. There is no chance you can go out and eat. Also, bringing food inside hostel is against the rules.

11. There is mobile phone radio Jammers in Girls hostel. It is an electronic device which makes it not possible to use Mobile phones within a certain area as you will not get network signal.

12. We had absolutely no rights as adult 18+ citizens. We were treated worse than school children. We had to get signatures from parents for every small things. The parents have to come to college every semester to review the performance, and so that the school--teachers can complain about us. Even the leaves for medical reasons required a phone call from parents, a written letter from parents and a medical certificate from a reputable doctor.

13. We were not allowed to celebrate anything inside the campus, like cutting cake for someone's birthday etc. My senior friend and his class was fined because they celebrated a classmates birthday by cutting cake inside the classroom.

Damn, I got carried away with these old memories.. Let's get into the topic.

This time, a first year computer science engineering student named Jishnu committed suicide after not being able to bear the torture. He was a pretty creative student who had won several technical competitions and had even featured on newspapers for a device he invented. He was also a freelance web developer.

According to his classmates, Jishnu who allegedly glanced behind and was asked to stand up by one Mr. Praveen, the invigilator in the examination hall(This 'professor' was fired from previous two colleges for misbehaving with girls). Jishnu was scolded before his fellow students and was then taken to the Vice Principal's room where he was mentally tortured for more than an hour. His answer sheet, in which he had almost finished his test, was torn up. He was told that he had been debarred from writing exams for 3 years. He came back to hostel, disillusioned, alone and lost, with his future threatened and he found himself incapable of addressing the situation. He committed suicide.

It is also alleged that the P.R.O of the college also physically tortured him. There were bruise marks and his leg was swollen on his dead-body. Although this guy holds the position of public relations officer, he is the son of a politician and he owns half of the shares of the college. He is well known to take students to his room and physically punch them like a goonda. The disciplinary inspectors are also nothing but goondas hired under the name of disciplinary inspector. They have no qualification other than a big tough body. (I have not experienced any physical torture, but many have and it is a well known fact in the college.)

They have cctv cameras everywhere, if what the college is saying is true, then why not release the video footage of the copying incident, or the video after Jishnu got out of the principal's office? Latest reports says the university investigative team found the college management’s statement of 'caught copying, hence committed suicide' to be false. ([Source](http://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/kerala/ktu-officials-find-college-contention-of-copying-false-1.1643951))

This news remains hidden from the mainstream-media till now. Today many students and local parties protested in a kindof bad way, they shattered some window glass and such stuff, which I do not approve at all.) and some local news are now covering it. Even then, many media groups refused to write the name of the college and instead used the word 'popular college'.

*Why students still join this college?*  I also joined it with lot of dreams and aspirations. I wanted to be a great Engineer and I wasn't forced into engineering by anyone. The thing is, no one outside the college knows about all these bad things. It is kindof a secret which only the students know. They even advertise 'Wifi campus' although there are no wifi points which are accessible to students, plus mobiles & laptops are banned. Only the positive news get spread in media and due to this, this college has a quite big name in Kerala. Many students come from distant districts to study here! More than half of the seats are filled with merit students who got selected after writing the Kerala Engineering test, so they have no other option. Also, once you join, there is no turning back. If you want to change colleges or drop out, you will be forced to pay the entire 4 year's fee!

One good thing I can say about this college. There is absolutely no ragging from any senior students... But, well...instead you can get mental torture from management. Infact, students of different years are not allowed to talk to each other. Seniors are scared to talk to juniors, as they can face suspension if the junior complains about anything. There is one case where a senior just asked the name of a junior girl, she didnt like it, so she went and reported it. The senior was suspended.

And, do you know what? I would call this a medium-strict college. I know of other colleges in Tamil Nadu which are 10X more strict, and for those students, this may seem like heaven. I guess these are the legalized concentration camps of today's era.

This is the first time in over 7 years where some students have gathered courage to come together to protest this. If it doesn't get enough media attention, then they are likely to get silenced in a week, then de-barred, and the next protest wouldn't happen for many years until someone else commits suicide.

When Rohith Vemula committed suicide in 2016, the initial few shows which Arnab did was absolutely fascinating. Pinning down the college officials and the local political leaders who led to his unfortunate suicide, he demolishd them on live TV, demanding from the Govt what everyone wanted: Justice.

Within 12 months, under allegedly Govt pressure, this whole narrative dramatically shifted, and in a cheap, disgusting move, Arnab kept on hammering the caste angle, somehow trying to prove that being a dalit had no role in Rohith's suicide.

This was a shameless twist of greed and immorality by Arnab, and this was the reason why Kunal Kamra created this drama in flight. He is not a fool to take panga against entire Govt machinary, neither an attention seeking pseudo liberal.

He questioned the ethics and morality of being a journalist, and I see absolutely no wrong in that.

## TL; DR:

On 5th February, 2020 the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) announced the launch of its Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it provides the basis for the creation of the Digital Content Complaint Council (along the lines of a similar system in place for TV) to oversee content creation and distribution in the online video streaming space. Although there are only four signatories (as opposed to nine in the case of a previous iteration), there are rumbling that the group is seeking government endorsement of this initiative. We have written to the IAMAI and copied the letter to both the Union Ministries of Information & Broadcasting; and Electronics and Information Technology highlighting how this will lead to self-censorship to the detriment of internet users, creators, producers and competition within the market. Based on these grounds we have asked the industry body to roll back the code and asked government authorities to refrain from endorsing the framework.

## Background

This post is to update everyone that there is a risk brewing in India’s online video streaming space. And said risk could see us sleep walk into a scenario where online content in India, mimics its formulaic television counterpart. On 5th February 2020, at its annual India Digital Summit, the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) launched its *Code for Self-Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers*. It follows up an earlier *Code of Best Practices for Online Curated Content Providers* the industry body had  put out in January 2019.

Unlike the previous code which had nine signatories, the latest iteration has just four signatories namely, Hotstar, Voot, Jio and SonyLiv. Prior signatories including Netflix, Zee5, AltBalaji, Arre and ErosNow were conspicuously absent at the new code’s launch. Other major players like Amazon (Prime) and Google (YouTube Premium) have stayed away from the process since its inception. Considering India has more than 35 online video streaming providers, the Code is not really representative of the entire industry’s position. So then why are we concerned if it is only being carried out by such a small number of players?

## Our Take: This is a precursor to self-censorship and for online streaming to go down the path of TV

Simply put it is the first step towards broad basing self-censorship as industry practice in India’s online video streaming space. If that is indeed the outcome, it would adversely impact internet users in India, creators, artists, production companies and so on. It is also likely to harm competition, innovation, investment and would facilitate industry capture by a few firms over the ecosystem.

The framework essentially builds on the original code of best practices through some key changes. First and most importantly, it seeks to establish an independent enforcement authority called the Digital Content Complaint Council (DCCC) to oversee a signatory’s content related practices. This DCCC mechanism is eerily similar and largely derivative of the [**Broadcast Content Complaints Council (BCCC)**](https://www.ibfindia.com/sites/default/files/Guidelines--Term%20of%20broadcas%20changes.pdf) (under the Indian Broadcasting Foundation) which essentially governs content on non-news and television channels in India.

We all know what that has meant to Indian television and how that has led to a largely homogenous content ecosystem, inundated by typical saas-bahu programming devoid of much creativity or pathos. Moreover, how often do we watch our favourite international content on TV and get bummed out that a large chunk of the programming has been edited out? In this context, the online video streaming space was a breadth of fresh air for Indian audiences who were fans of global and local storytelling. Further, it provided opportunities to local storytellers who had until then been rejected by traditional television, theatrical and radio media.

## The legal basis and policy need for this effort is questionable at best

In this context, it is disconcerting that even though there is no legal mechanism which empowers the DCCC, its ties with the Government are undeniable. The proposed DCCC is meant to be chaired by a retired High Court or Supreme Court judge. Also, the DCCC is designed to include three members from national level statutory commissions like the National Commission for Women (NCW), the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)  or the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). Its composition would also facilitate incumbent business capture as the DCCC is meant to include three industry representatives and two online curated content providers (likely to be signatories to the Code). Considering the opaque manner (with no public/stakeholder inputs) in which the Code has been developed, and the public facing impact such a privately designed framework can have-- the legal validity of this effort remains dubious at best.

Second, such codified structures essentially provide the Government a parallel avenue with little to no legal accountability to apply pressure on businesses to censor people’s views and beliefs. It erodes channels for dissent and satire-- and is arguably incompatible with the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression under the Constitution of India.

Third, like the previous code on best practices, the new code for self-regulation talks about “prohibited content”. What is particularly dangerous is that the newest draft has been modified in a manner which makes the grounds for censorship vaguer. This would afford the DCCC with more discretion to remove certain speech/content which would otherwise be legal under the Constitution of India and also applicable laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860.  This is compounded by the fact that the DCCC does not envision membership of stakeholders from research, academia or free speech backgrounds, to act as a safeguard for people’s right to receive and impart information. Therefore, it may be concluded that this Code is merely a liability reduction initiative which is being pushed through at the cost of plurality, diversity and creativity-- all cornerstone’s of the right to free speech and expression.

## Our letter to IAMAI

In a [**letter dated 17th January, 2019**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9LKE-1DkhtFY3ZWWXpRdnRuVEpwWmMzYW1kR21yejA3d2g0/view) we had previously written to the IAMAI voicing our objection to the initial Code for Best Practices. We argued it was a slippery slope which would act as a precursor towards self-censorship in the Indian online content space. Our beliefs are reinforced by the latest Code for Self-Regulation and we have [**sent a representation to the IAMAI**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b3eJQghsUwOJEYU1ri0ah2roO0BVSju0/view?usp=sharing) requesting them to roll back the effort. In addition, we have shared a copy with both the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB), to brief them with the issues of endorsing the framework.

This list can be improved, by expanding each point a little, by adding links, by adding new points and by grouping some of the points together or listing them in order of chronology. On each of the following points we can make memes/detailed explanations and distribute on social media.

1. 2002 Riots complicity.

2. [Haren Pandya murder](https://caravanmagazine.in/politics/haren-pandya-narendra-modi-murder-case-supreme-court) Haren Pandya was a popular leader of BJP in Gujarat and a potential rival of Modi. He was assassinated while he was on a morning walk. His security was mysteriously withdrawn by the Gujarat government headed by Modi just days before his murder.

4. Sanjiv Bhatt is in jail. If an IAS officer is in jail in India, most likely he would be very honest. [https://www.firstpost.com/india/ips-officer-sanjiv-bhatt-sacked-shame-then-frame-trend-part-of-vendetta-politics-of-gujarat-2400796.html](https://www.firstpost.com/india/ips-officer-sanjiv-bhatt-sacked-shame-then-frame-trend-part-of-vendetta-politics-of-gujarat-2400796.html) The case of Sanjiv Bhatt is a prime example of the vindictive politics of Modi. Sanjiv Bhatt may or may not be innocent, but it is clear that  Modi can stoop to any level to ruthlessly destroy his opponents. Sanjiv Bhatt was sentenced for life in a 30 years old case.  To put this in perspective 180 custodial deaths happened in Gujarat in 16 years, not  a single cop was punished Read more at: [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/180-custodial-deaths-in-gujarat-in-16-years-no-cop-punished/articleshow/69881991.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/180-custodial-deaths-in-gujarat-in-16-years-no-cop-punished/articleshow/69881991.cms)
5. In 2005, Sanjay Joshi, Sangh's blue-eyed boy and Modi's rival, figured in a controversial CD. He was immediately removed from all posts in the BJP. The video was later revealed to be doctored; a police officer later testified that the CD was given to him by controversial police officer DG Vanzhara. But, by then, Joshi had fallen from his perch.

35,190,An open letter to Justice A.P. Shah on the online video self-regulatory code,186.0,f34zc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f34zc2/an_open_letter_to_justice_ap_shah_on_the_online/,25.0,1581600006.0,"TL; DR:

Last week the the Internet and  Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) announced the launch of its Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. This code industry wide code is signed by just 4 online video streaming providers and is intended to apply to the entire sector. It will require self-censorship practices which are there in the Television sector to be implemented for online video streaming services such as Arre, Amazon Prime, MX Player and Netflix. The code also creates a private body called the Digital Content Complaint  Council (DCCC) to judge complaints and impose penalties. As per [**press reports**](https://www.livemint.com/industry/media/hotstar-voot-others-sign-up-to-form-complaints-council-for-ott-platforms-11580907470733.html) it will be headed by Justice A.P. Shah who is a steadfast defenders of civil liberties and democratic values. With a view to place the several concerns of institutionalized self-censorship and chilling effects, we wrote him an open letter yesterday.

## In detail

In the past [**we have repeatedly warned**](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/) of the dangers of a dangerous self-censorship system for online video services that is being championed by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (""IAMAI""). This system is called the, ""Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers"" and we have [**in detail explained how this will cause tremendous damage**](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/) to artistic creativity, user choice and innovation in the video streaming sector. This essentially institutionalises a dangerous TV style self-censorship system that will have a chilling effect on the diversity of content and programming.

This ""Self Regulatory"" code also creates a judicial body with what is called as a, ""Tier 2"" for adjudicating any complaints on the content of the shows which are aired on online video streaming services. This body is called the Digital Content Complaint Council (""DCCC"") and when the intial complaints to the signatories of this code (which are online streaming companies) are not settled, it hears them as a judicial case. It also will determine complaints sent by government departments and also can take suo-motu action. Such powers are generally modeled from the Broadcast Content Complaint Council (""BCCC"") that is a body for television broadcasters in India. The results of such practices in the TV sector are for everyone to see (*or, due to censorship not see*).

As per [**media reports**](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/) the first Chairperson of the DCCC is the distinguished jurist and the retired Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, Hon'ble Justice (Retd.) Mr. A.P. Shah. We hold Justice Shah in the highest regard for his intellect and courage in being a consistent voice for democratic rights - [**especially media freedoms**](https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/x3Es2gcvZvuZbYqwiWMQuN/Justice-AP-Shah--Judge-of-the-brave.html). Due to the lack of response by the IAMAI we, yesterday sent an open letter to Justice Shah highlighting our concerns and prior correspondence. This is in our continuing effort that self-censorship practices that have made TV broadcast an arid medium do not migrate to the internet. Our letter to Justice Shah is a good faith effort. While we have the highest faith in his ability to adjudicate and hold this position while protecting free expression. However, the larger, industry wide model that is being institutionalized and is likely to be cemented that will last beyond his term is injurious.

A. The most glaring instance of the government’s failure to support labour standards is the Ministry of Labour’s proposal to fix the national minimum floor wage at ₹178, without any defined criteria or method of estimation.

B. This could lead to a dangerous race to the bottom by individual States, in a bid to attract capital and investments. This is rightly being called ‘starvation wage’, especially given that the Ministry’s own committee recommended ₹375 as the minimum. 

C. Another concerning issue is that the four codes exclude over 95% of the workforce employed in informal units and small enterprises, who in fact are in greater need of legal safeguards

D. There is no clarity on who constitutes an ‘employer’, an ‘employee’ or an ‘enterprise’, giving the owner greater discretion to interpret the provisions while making it more difficult for the worker to draw any benefits from them.

E. The code on wages legitimises and promotes further contractualisation of labour, instead of abolishing it, by insulating the principal employer from liabilities and accountability in the case of irregularities on the part of the contractors.

F. it is proposed that ‘apprentices’ be no longer considered employees, at a time when evidence indicates that apprentices are made to do jobs of contractual as well as permanent employees. 

G. And if all this were not enough, the wage code also brings back the draconian provision of “recoverable advances”, a system that the Supreme Court clearly linked to coercive and bonded labour, wherein distressed and vulnerable migrant labourers could be bonded to work through advance payments. This is akin to modern forms of slavery, also encountered in rural labour markets.

H. Similarly, the eight-hour workday shift has been done away with, and multiple provisions of increased overtime have been inserted. The code also gives ample alibis to employers to evade bonus payments.

I. seeking justice against unfair practices of employers has become even more difficult now as non-payment of wages will now not be a criminal offence and penalties in case of non-compliance have been reduced. The government wants to provide a “facilitative” rather than a regulatory and punitive environment for the owners, with “facilitators-cum-inspectors” replacing the “inspectors” who used to ensure implementation of various labour laws to aid employees.

J. The code even has a provision on “employees below fifteen years of age”, which can be construed as legalisation of *child labour*.",2020.0,2.0,14.0,23:26:28,justice

>On March 17, 1970, the Sain family in Burdwan was witness to violence that would go on to become election lore for many years in come in Bengal. Complaints registered with the police said that CPI(M) goons first set the Sain's house (Sain bari in Bengali) on fire. Then they barged into the house and killed three members of the panic stricken family. The eldest son's eyes were gouged out, another hacked to death and the third chased across the neighbourhood and butchered in a neighbour's house he tried to hide in. The young tutor of the Sain family's small children, who was present in the house at that time, was stabbed to death.

>A year after the carnage, the eldest son, then blinded and defenceless as a result of the previous attack, was literally chopped to pieces. Beyond the police records, gruesome details of the attack dominated political conversations for years. How the inebriated, murderous CPI(M) mob celebrated the murders with the corpses lying around, how they mixed rice in the blood of the massacred victims and tried to feed it to the women of the family. Yet, the CPI(M) overthrew the Congress government and came to power  a few years later. Allegedly, one of the accused in the case, Nirupam Sen, went on to become the state industries minister.

>On March 17, 1970, the incident happened a day after the United Front government was toppled. The Sains who were known to be Congress loyalists were attacked and two brothers Pranab Sain and Moloy Sain were brutally murderd in front of their mother and later their mother Mriganayani was forced to eat rice which was stained with her sons blood. Even a tutor who had come to their home at that time Jiten Ray was also murdered. """"After the murder and attack the CPM supporters took out a procession from our house,"""" recalled Swarnalata Jash who is a prime witness in this gruesome murder. On that day hes six month old son's 'Annaprasan' was going to take place and even the killers had tossed her son Amrit to kill the six month old baby, claimed, Swarnalata Jash.

Ahmadiyyas are persecuted by Shias and Sunnis world wide and not recognized as Muslims but are in India - except by the AIMPLB. This is outrageous and a mockery of our constitution. It may be a private institution but should abide by the law of the land. The AIMPLB also look down on the Shia community of India and deny them higher position in the community and organisation.

> This is an organisation of Sunni fundamentalists which does not take into its fold Shia and Ahmadiyya Muslims. Its duty is to protect Muslim personal laws which are based on Sharia. It supports the antediluvian system of triple talaq, child marriage, and opposes gay rights. It objects to any change in the divorce laws to confer parity to Muslim women. This board issues fatwas against reforms in Islam and all kinds of progressive ideas. The misogynistic law board should be abolished for the sake of Muslims. Muslims need no other laws but modern civil laws based on equality and justice.

40,200,"124th Constitution Amendment Bill : 10% reservation for ""financially poor"". An anti-poor, exclusive reservation for few of the upper-castes",62.0,ev3hww,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ev3hww/124th_constitution_amendment_bill_10_reservation/,32.0,1580233422.0,"[The Wire](https://thewire.in/government/ews-quota-consultation-law-ministry)

[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/lok-sabha-clears-124-constitution-amendment-bill-to-give-quota-for-general-category/articleshow/67441684.cms?from=mdr)

 The reservation is for 'Financial-poor' of the following communities in the 'job and education  :

>The major castes to benefit from the proposed law are **Brahmins, Rajputs (Thakurs), Jats, Marathas, Bhumihars, several trading castes, Kapus and Kammas among other upper castes.**


* Deception in name : They are calling it reservation for 'financially poor' whereas it is all about the benefit of upper caste against rest of the population.

If it is for 'financially poor' than why include caste on first place? make it for all of the poor of the country.

* Exclusion of dalits & ""Creamy layer"" in Sc/St reservation : BJP/RSS invented the term 'creamy layer' to further progress their oppression of dalits in a much more fundamental level such as constitution itself. 

The reservation is given to dalits to lift them out of their 'slave' status in society and the country, It has nothing to do with their 'Financial situation', If govt. is so worried about poorer dalits not getting benefits than they should make a separate reservation for poor-dalits based on their 'financial situation'  which is apart from their 'social status'  

The majority of poor people of the country belong to dalit community then why they are excluded from this new reservation for 'financially poor' ?

This new reservation defines poverty as having income of  less than 8 lakh rupees per year. The poverty line defined by indian govt. is 32 rupees per day or  Rs.11,680  per year. So on one hand govt./RSS/BJP is calling dalits who are benefiting from reservation but earn more than **Rs.32 per day as 'Creamy Layer'** whereas an upper caste who earns less than **Rs.2191 per day is considered as 'Poor'.**

On other hand only 15% of upper castes are poor (that percentage in dalits is 80% ).

*  The bill was rushed under 20 days without even having either proper discussion or exposure to public :

>from drawing board to law within a span of just 20 days.
Not only this – instead of getting cabinet approval for amendments in the office memorandum of the Bill,  Narendra Modi made use of a special privilege the prime minister has under government rules of business while the Union minister for social justice approved the cabinet note over the phone. In addition, on the request of the latter’s ministry, **the Lok Sabha speaker gave special preference to the Bill and waived the conditional requirement of seven days to introduce it in parliament** , documents obtained by The Wire under the Right to Information Act have revealed.

Contrarily, govt. is still refusing to publish the population census which will tell us the new population percentage of dalits in india.

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2) G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF’ Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

#### E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project

* The E-Courts Project was conceptualized based on the ""National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary - 2005"" submitted by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India (set up in 2004).
* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 7) World’s largest cavefish discovered in Meghalaya

A team of experts from the UK, Switzerland, and India have discovered the world’s largest species of cavefish in Meghalaya’s Jaintia Hills.

#### About

* The cavefish, similar in anatomy to an endangered mahseer species, is around one and a half feet in length and was found inside a remote cave in Jaintia Hills.
* The fish has no eyes and is white due to a lack of melanin pigmentation.
* As they live in a nutrient-limited environment most of these species are small.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

### 9) Amendments in Arms Act, 1959 and Arms Rules, 2016 notified

* Shooting is an important Olympic sport in India. The Indian shooters have excelled in international competitions. Keeping this in mind, the Ministry of Home Affairs, vide its notification issued under the Arms Act 1959, has made provisions to provide adequate firearms and ammunition to the shooters for their practice.

Fueled by my family beliefs and being a ideal kid I always believed that every party except BJP is a corruption ridden party who only gets vote by manipulating minorites and uneducated poor people. In 2014 like many people I was in awe of Modi. I genuinely believed that he is a intelligent, hardworking guy and that he can help this country reach great hights. 
Soon i started going to college, meet new people, saw new ideas and came out of the bubble that i was living in  throughout my school life. Slowly and steadily all the smoke screen in front of me was getting cleared. 
First time I felt that i made a mistake was when BJP chose Adityanath as the CM. I was vocal about it with my family because i believed that my family would be accepting of my difference of opinion but it was otherwise and i was surprised. For the first time in my life i saw a hint of toxic mindset of some of my relatives. With time i was getting more and more critical of this government, first social and later economic policies and I started arguing with my family more and more about it alone about it by giving them real verified facts. Their best counter to me was whataboutism, calling our generation misguided and if nothing worked calling me part of ""JNU gang"", leftist, tukde tukde gang, Anti-national etc. It countinued for 3 years and it all boiled down to one day when i was extremely Ill and one of my of relative called me a supporter of kashmiri terrorists because i tried to defend basic human rights after section 377 got abolished. I just gave up that day and cried for hours and promised myself to never talk to them about politics ever again or ever giving them my opinion.
 Since then i stayed silent and because of my silence I started seeing their true colours. The amount of hate they have for that particular community has made me angry and depressed.  They love the ""justice"" this government is giving to the community they despise so much.
Tonight i went to one of my relatives place with my dad to congratulate them about something and there they asked my dad to find a new home someplace else because according to him the place around them is getting infested by the community thry hate so much and before i  could even process this his wife added that this country should never ever had been secular and all  the people they hate should had been removed out of this country in 1947 only.
I really wanted to argue and fight with them this time but i stopped because my parents believes that doing thsi is detrimental for our family and i should stay quiet and bear with them because they are elder to me and be a good kid. Right now i have no one in my life with whom i can to openly talk about my opinions and this is making me feel depressed and frustrated. 
So, i came here to rant.

* I'll have 1-2 friends as company & they can be alternate drivers. 
* We will be driving sober with sufficient breaks. 
* None of us are druggies / smokers. 
* There will be night halts en route to soak in the local flavours / food / sights. 

I have made longer road trips while I was in the US, and I understand that both countries are totally different experiences. I'm very comfortable and adjusted to desi roads and traffic conditions (Delhi & highways around) so my kulcha- and dish-bhakti-ki-bhavna are inspiring me to do a road trip here. 

I have driven Delhi - Jaipur, so I'm familiar with the road quality. I want to know if anyone has driven the entire stretch / majority stretch on this route. 

& if anyone has done so, my questions are:

1. Road quality: how drivable are the roads between Jaipur & Mumbai?

2. Road safety: how safe are the roads in terms of robbery / accident risks, etc? 

3. Any other questions I should be asking, and the answers to those. 

4. Your suggestions on how to make this more enjoyable.

20,131,[NP] A small write-up as a tribute to the Amazing Police of Chennai,10.0,1ywxrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1ywxrm/np_a_small_writeup_as_a_tribute_to_the_amazing/,6.0,1393383849.0,"So , I am really very new to India and I had to go to this place called Chennai which is in Tamil Nadu. Several people warned me about how horrible it would be for someone with no knowledge of Tamil. They also warned me to be //as Indian as possible// with my accent , but I am way too bad at faking one.

The fear what my fellow colleagues had imparted in me began to become true. I had travelled by bus and reached Chennai at 5 in the morning. Always wanting to travel in an Auto-Rickshaw  , I boarded one outside the bus station. There began the horrors what I was warned of. He charged me a whooping 500 INR for a distance of 6-7km. I could not negotiate with him as I did not speak any Indian Language except Hindi and hence paid the fare , unwillingly.

Fast-forwarding the story to the evening:

After the meet , my bus was scheduled to leave to Bengaluru (My Base) at 11:15 PM and I had a lot of free time plus Corporate Car and Driver (EXHAUST ALL THE RESOURCE!!!) 

Somewhere near DLF IT SEZ , I stopped for tea and I had my phone in my side-pocket. A gang of people abruptly crowded the counter when I was about to pay my bill and flicked my phone before I could even realize it was gone. My phone costs about 50-60k INR which is absolutely a huge sum of money and moreover it had all my contacts and my ticket to back-home. 

Not expecting any help , I went to the police to formally lodge a complaint. Luckily I had someone translate the robbery. They took my phone number and IMEI details. I came back to Bangalore and today I recieved a call from Chennai Police saying my phone was found and they would return it back to me after I showed them a Proof-of-Purchase.

I was told to forget about my phone amd that the Indian Police system did not entertain such cases .. But , It was amazing how in 5 days the Police found my phone!

Yesterday my gf and her bff were smoking in Chembur area at their usual place. They noticed a stalker and they ignored. As they're very much adjusted to being visually stalked. Gf had some doubts and stood up to get a clear view and saw the guy was masturbating, she started shivering and notified the bff. They immediately got up and left that closed down 'tapri' and took another path. The man got up, and was stalking them from afar and started following.

This is where they stopped a Uncle on bike and informed him about the incident. To their shock, the uncle scolded them why are they roaming here and asked them to buzz off from the area. The stalker was still following them, so my gf called a male friend, while other one called 103. The police asked their co-ordinates. The stalker was keeping a sharp eye on pedestrians, while they decided to lure him by settling down at one place. He again started masturbating, my gf was getting panicked by each moment, while her bff calmed her down. Finally they came, the big blue van full of constables. The man ran and to their surprise, he was a handicap, so they shouted that ""him him"" the police caught hold of him and beat him. At first my gf was even terrified to look at him until constables slapped the guy multiple times and he started apologizing for what he was doing. Here comes the imp part

They asked to file a complaint so he can be detained, but my petrified girl couldn't. They told to give him some beating and leave him off. The police insisted on complaint bt they were terrified as it was their first time in this situation. Police took names and numbers of victim as well as perpertrator and thrashed him good.

The male friend arrived and scolded them as they didn't lodge a complaint. He said ""today its you, tomorrow what if he tries this on a small girl?"" But I cant blame them, their were terrified as fuck, even while narrating this, my gf was tearing up and fumbling.

Guys, pls tell your female friends to pursue legal action against such pervs. This must not be his first time and definitely not the last. I'm waiting for her to normalize a bit then i'll have to make her understand the importance of pursuing the legal action against him.

I'm very sure her reasoning for not doing so would be something like ""what if later on he throws acid on me ? what if he does anything to me while I'm alone?""

I'll keep notified if something happens

TL;DR : stalker was masturbating while watching her, called police, but refused to lodge complaint

How do these people are signals and skywalks get away with sexually harassing people for money? Surely someone would have made a complaint against this. I’ve seen these people harass foreigners which makes me so sad because it degrades our nations name. Also I’ve noticed that the twitter police accounts and the ips officers are really active on twitter and help the people a lot(major props to them) but they will never look into these issues. It is so irritating and disgusting. 
The worst part is that they make the lgbtq community look bad. During normals convos whenever the topic of transgenders come up, we naturally assume that we are talking about the “chakkas” who dress up as a “female” and harass the people.

TL;DR; Accidentally read girlfriends emails, thought she was cheating, turns out she is getting sexually harassed at work and is going to quit today.


My girlfriend and I have been seeing each other for just over 2 years and living together for the past 3 weeks. We've had a few ups and downs, we both cope with problems fairly differently, I usually prefer to talk through things and she has traditionally been closed off and sometimes blunt/rude.


I have had a few bouts of mental health concerns, primarily to do with anxiety and depression. I'm on a CBT course for it at the moment and throughout the course of our 2 years it's come up in discussions and she's been supportive, although because of our varying approaches to handling things it's not always useful. I'm by no means crippled by it, but I thought it might be useful context for the problems I'm having at the minute.


We've been through a lot, travelled around the world, driven across India. We challenge each other and I think overall I am a much better person for having known her. Beginning in the new year we had already decided we were going to move in together and things had been really great, we were connecting in a way I hadn't connected with someone else before. We have since discussed this change and we've come to the conclusion that a lot of our low points were caused by misunderstandings and not appreciating/understanding each other, which living together seems to have resolved.


So, on to the real meat of the story. She has been working at the same place for 8 years and career wise has done very well, she seems great at her job and has progressed very quickly up the ladder. I was logging on to my emails on my phone browser as the app wasn't functioning. She had at some point in the past used my phone when hers was out of battery and it logged straight into her emails. I didn't realise, did a search for what I was looking for in mine and found about 50 emails to and fro between her and a guy at work called David.These were about a year old and mostly between him and her while she was away trekking around South America for a month.


For a bit more background, she had been very keen to keep work and personal lives separate. Her coworkers never came to parties, didn't mingle with her friends, never met me. I was also under the impression she didn't talk about me at work. I knew she struggled at work with something, but had always assumed it was pressure. Sometimes I wondered if it was something wrong with me, and told her as much. Was she ashamed of me or something? Hence the previous mention of mental health bits, sometimes this anxiety caused me to fall into a bit of a downward spiral.


So she's got these emails from David, who is her boss asking about me, asking her if she loves me, if I've said I loved her. At the time of the emails she said she wasn't sure and that I had never said it. This wasn't true. There was talk of ""us [her and David]"" and guilt and some other fairly explosive things.


I immediately ring her and ask her what's happened with David, she said she needs time to explain and she wants to meet me. So we both leave our given offices rather abruptly and agree to meet at home.


We start talking, she was sorry, that she understood if I was angry but that I might not have the full story. She revealed she and David had slept together a few times way before we met (also of note is that David is married) and that he had developed a bit of an obsessions with her. She tried to keep me out of the her work life because she didn't want me to get hurt. She explained that he constantly quizzed her on our relationship, whether they could go back to sleeping together, pressuring her into answering her. It was relentless and whatever I had read was only a small part of it.


It was a struggle that first night, she spoke of moving out, I had told her that if anything had happened since we had met that I wanted to know. She promised nothing had and she was only ever responding to him because he had a tendency to make her life harder if she didn't.


We spoke a lot, talked about things in a way we never had before. I struggled because I wanted to be angry at her for keeping something a secret, making me feel like I wasn't good enough for her, and bringing her anger from this over into our life. I was annoyed, and recounted all of the times we had fallen out in the last 2 years and how much we could have just avoided it had I known what was causing her so much pain. I was conscious that I couldn't be too angry at her, I believed her, and wasn't sure what I would have done in the same situation. 


So we made up, I had a breakdown, we made up again. She went out 2 days later with a friend for a few drinks and we both knew I wouldn't be OK when she got home, we talked for a long time and tried to get to the bottom of everything. We agreed we would talk more often, tell each other whatever we were feeling and muddle through. I was struggling piecing together all the information; what I had read in emails, what she had said, the arguments we had over the whole relationship, that one time I wondered where she was and couldn't get hold of her for a few hours. I was tormented by the memories of seeing her texting him while we were out, she worked hard outside of work and when I saw her texting David I had assumed it was work related and brushed it off. Part of the problems I have are related to racing thoughts and the inability to clear your brain, so all of this information was driving me up the wall. The past 4 days my mood has been swinging fairly wildly from being content and happy to being silent and lost.


Today is the first day she has been back in to work since (she took Friday off) and I think the plan is that she is going to quit. I'm a little angry because I don't think he should be able to get away with what he's done, but she is quite compassionate and doesn't want anyone to get hurt.


I am fairly certain I believe everything she said, she has always told me she hates liars, and apart from this one very big cover up she has never lied to me before (sometimes she a little too honest). But the niggling persists, I find that not knowing the details is the hardest part. I have asked her a lot of questions and she has answered, but there are some that I think I can't ask her.


I hope all that made sense, I can't talk to anyone that I know about this as they all get on well with her and I wouldn't want them to think differently of her. I have had the benefit of some very intimate heart to heart conversations with her I believe her, but without that I think some of my friends might be too quick to think that she did cheat.


So that's where I am now, I'm just confused as to how I should handle it, usually googling helps with relationship advice but this is a fairly niche problem and has a fair bit of nuance. When I'm happy things with her are better than ever, we are more intimate and definitely more dedicated to making sure the other is happy. The problem is the low points, I feel like I'm lost with no outlet for my frustrations. I would love to find David and confront him, but I know I can't do that because it could damage her career (He is quite well respected in his field).

[EDIT: Added extra line breaks]

EDIT: A few clarification from a reply below as I realised I may have skipped over a few points;

Harassment is definitely a word she used, it's daily and she'd labelled him psychotic.

I didn't ask her to quit, she said she had always want to, going as far as to apply for new jobs a few months back, but not following through on an offer because I convinced her to stay (obviously completely unaware of the real reason she wanted to quit). The reason she wants to quit is because he is making her work life miserable.

I also should explain my use of the word breakdown, I'm by no means a violent man and my definition of a breakdown is a slump from which I need some help getting out of. She completely understood as I explained that I still trusted her it was just that I was being somewhat tormented by my anxiety.

I understand that I need to support her, I was hoping that posting here would give me some objective views so I can put aside my own insecurities to help her.

I have tried to encourage her to report him in the hope that he is punished for this rather than her. To my mind he should be the one quitting, I have suggested she go to the Citizens Advice Bureau to get an understanding of what she should do, but I think the past few days have been so overwhelming for her that she just wants to put it behind her.

Throwaway account. 

I need help in finding good therapists in Bangalore for helping out a survivor of domestic violence. Money is currently not a barrier. 

The person invovled is the sister of a friend. She was mentally tortured by her mother-in-law for the last few years. 

A bit of a background :

My friend is based in Bangalore. However he is originally from the northern part of the country. His sister got married to someone from the same state and her husband works in one of the 4 big metros. However the woman was forced to spend most of the time in the family home and only a couple of months a year with her husband. The mother-in-law has a very tight grip on her son and her son does not go against her wishes (he has turned a blind eye towards all ill treatment meted out to his wife). My friend's sister was forced to cut off all her ties with her family and only after a grovelling apology made by her parents was she allowed to get back in touch with them. The couple have a daughter (who is 1 and a half years old) and the matters came to a head a few months ago when my friend's sister wanted to go home but the mother-in-law did not agree. However she managed to go home after her relatives made a hungama and attracted the attention of people in the mohalla. 

Once she got back home she realized that there is no point in continuing this and wants a divorce. However she is scared of the whole process. We are thinking therapy will be important. 

I am aware that there is Vanitha Sahayavani - which is the Bangalore Police initiative to help domestic violence survivors. How reliable is it?  One worry is if there will be push to file a case or a legal recourse before my friend's family is ready for it. We are more concerned about getting the woman in the right frame of mind.

So after 10 days of traveling with a 'tour package' with my GF we have realized we were victims of a huge scam that costs us thousands of dollars.

My gf and I arrived on Delhi after midnight. We were very tired, our flight was delayed and we had been traveling all day... We got a taxi at Delhi airport to take us to our hotel. He stops on this road that looks dark and closed. He tells us he can't take us to our hotel as the roads are closed because of the protests. So we need to go to a tourist center where they will help us find accommodation. Everything seemed odd but we were extremely tired and we were aware there were protests going on those days. 

At the tourist centre, some men with very good English explain to us that the government has closed the city  due to protests. He even googles the protests and shows me how some people have died. He also tells us there's not many hotels available and the only ones with rooms were very expensive. So here he tells us he can help by organising a trip for us. 

He basically sells us a very expensive package which included driver, tickets to Taj Mahal, boat ride in Varanasi, accommodation, etc etc. He gave us 3 options and we picked the one with the lower price which was still quite pricey. In retrospective, I know there's a lot we could've done different. This is very hurtful for us. The money is a problem but what hurts the most is that we had some plans in India like going to Goa which those guys at the tourist agency strongly recommended not to go to. They just wanted us to pay for the package. Now we're in debt for thousands of dollars because we were vulnerable, saw no other option and we were in a completely new different environment. After so much traveling we just wanted a solution.

I feel so much anger and sadness. 

It seems this scam has been going on for years as we found this link:

It seems like even the police here are very corrupt so I feel completely helpless. Even if there's nothing that can be done. Thanks for reading and please pass on this message to anyone traveling here. 

TLDR: Got scammed into buying a very expensive tour package. Now I'm thousands in debt. Learned that this scam has been going on for years.",2020.0,1.0,2.0,05:58:06,victim

Full story below.

Hi Reddit,

Please allow me to tell my story. It might be a bit long, but probably worth reading. Please, this is a sincere request.


**Background:**

I'm a 20-something Indian male here. To give you some background story, I lived in a community with fellow Americans, so I find myself not a typical Indian as such - in views, habits etc. At times, I feel I'm a mixed culture kid - my views, attitude about things are quite 'east/west' at times.
For the sake of story, my name will be Arthur.

**The beginning**

When I was 16, I met a girl in an international conference. She was from Ukraine. Let's call her - Yulia.
I was instantly attracted to her.
I was nervous, but I asked her for her email and we started talking.

We talked for several hours online and more and more I realized that I'm falling in love with her - she was smart, beautiful and quite my type.
She too responded me with the same feelings. 
But in summer, something suddenly changed. She started becoming offline often, and I saw her photos with some guy on a Russian social networking site. Something didn't felt right, and I asked her about it but her behavior started changing - she, for instance, accused me and told that its because of me that she is getting bad marks at uni and all the stuff with that guy is gossip.

I wasn't too content. I asked her friends, researched (stalked?) further and found that she is with him. I had some medical complications and I had to be admitted to hospital - before that I requested to talk to her for a few minutes. It was her birthday. I waited, but she didn't come online and later I found she had her first kiss with that guy.
Something deeply hurt me, as it felt like a betrayal of a sort.

She came back in summer, apologized for all her negative things, and then in 2 months she slept with that guy. Her first.
Still, I talked and talked. In some months she told me that she loves me. 
And after some other BS, I broke all connections with her.

I had to take a lot of mud from my family, since they're more conservative Indian family and according to them all Ukr/Russian girls are like prostitutes. Whatever!

She found another guy in between and that was it.

After finishing school, I worked for couple years at some interesting places. Met lots of people etc. 
And then I had an opportunity to do a project - in her city in Ukraine or in Moscow. 
Even though Moscow paid better, I chose her city.

**That Summer**

Year 2011:

Summer 2011, I went to her city - its in Eastern Ukraine.
I called her, she cut the call. 
(somehow by luck, she never changed her number in all these years)
I again called - told her I am in her city!
She came, we met, we went to her home, we talked. 

She was hesitant but she then told that she has had two guys in all these years. Somehow, I felt pissed off - since I was sort of thinking she is much more into me, and that she's sincere enough to think that love means commitment to one person and not to go into other guys at the same time.
In 4 days, I - despite being a shy guy, within two days picked up two girls and slept with them.
I felt at 'peace', having 'equaled' the things. I have never ever told her this thing, though she knows I kissed the first girl. This thing never mattered after that.

And then I went back to her.
That Summer changed everything in my life. I decided to be with her, whatever happens. In a movie-like style, I had my flight in Kiev, and I went to the airport, put my baggage, called her at 4 in the morning and asked her: Will you be with me? Will you support me if we are together? Do you love me?

Ditched the flight, went back. And started planning for moving to Ukraine.


____

**...the end?**

I was about to enter university at the same time. But instead, I decided to move to Ukraine. 
I had to go back to India.
I had a big argument with my family, and secretly I earned enough money and documentations. My family knows that there exists some girl named 'Yulia', but I never introduced her to them ever.
My visa got rejected, but applied again and came in February 2012.

It was wonderful, but I was frustrated because of huge language barrier (she speaks near-perfect English as well, but people here of course speak only Russian), because I had no support as such, because I/we had to work really hard to earn money, and because I still had memories from the past.
She gave me lots of love. Lots of care! 
In the heat of argument, I slapped her once...
Called her bad words and so on.
After few days, everything became perfect again.


Near June we had similar issue. My problem I realized was that when we had argument, suddenly she became too silent and avoiding me, and this pissed me off big time. She had cooked a cake for me, I threw it out. And I slapped her, second time.

Still things became fine.
In September I came back, on a Student Visa, and things started becoming much better.
I had university, and I had to work like an English teacher. She also had university, but she was already in Masters and had somehow better schedule than I did.
I also started working on a start-up. 
We didn't earn too much, but we lived in her parents' flat, and we were doing ok, and were extremely happy together!

Summer 2013, we traveled around Ukraine.
During travel, there was one instance where we had some arguments and again, she went on her 'no-talk' mode, and I became on my pissed off mode. No fight as such, and we overcame it.

Meanwhile my Russian became really good, and I could connect easily with people here. 

This year, in October, we had real issue.
My university load is increasing, and this hampered my ability to work too much. Still, I earned ok. 
I pushed her to move abroad for her postgraduate studies. She probably didn't want, but I sort of pushed as she never told me a clear No. (in fact a lots of times, yes)
Then she went to a conference in Lithuania.
I missed her so much. She always asked me to care for her in housework, which I lazy asshole never did. But during this period I tried doing everything better.
Everything was going ok. But then she came back, and suddenly something changed.

I had cleaned the house, but probably it wasn't up to her standards.
I started cooking, but this wasn't too much for her.
She started becoming negative in everything.

I made a schedule, so that I can know her schedule much better and cook food accordingly when she comes tired. She mocked me for it, saying it won't change anything ever.
The fact being I had just returned back to Ukraine after summer, and hence my earning wasn't too high. It was nonetheless 80% of what she earned. In November I was getting a big client - I had even asked her for things she'd like to buy, and wanted to take us for a good shopping spree, but sadly that money later on got spent on I moving from place to place after being kicked out.

And then we had big fight. She put a lot of venom on me, telling I have done nothing ever for this house, nothing for her, that I means zero, she hurt me and I slapped her. And she challenged me if I slap her again then she will leave me. 
Nonetheless, I slapped her. Fourth time in 2 years.

And then she left. Went to her parents.
Her dad asked me to leave the flat.

I wrote to her online. I said, look I apologize. I read more on internet and sought some help from acquaintances. I realized I might have anger problems there. I started working on them. I asked for a meeting with her parents

She said, ok, look we must behave like a good husband and wife. 
I said, yes dear. We'll do it. I asked her to hold me together. Together we should show them that maybe we have flaws but we can overcome them.

Her whole family came. Blamed me, accused me. Cancelled the flat contract. Spilled some more mud on me, and gave me some time to collect everything and get lost. 
She just sat there. Spoke once to tell them that actually she earns so much more. 



_________

**Now**

This ordeal that started literally shattered my life. I have no friends as such. One of my best Ukrainian acquaintance told: ""look, man, hitting was NOT the reason she left you..."" I didn't get it. He seemed to hint that reason was probably much more than that, maybe a guy? maybe something else?

For me, love happens one.
For 6 years, I have loved her. 
Made huge life decisions for her. And now I am left alone.


I still thought that I'll change myself and improve. Earn more, become much better guy, and be with her - in 1 month, 6 months, 1 year whatever. But I love her. 'We love to succeed', we used to tell each other. I am not used to hitting girls or hitting anyone. I am not an aggressive person, as such. But in any case, whatever trace of flaws is left, I will make myself better.

Slowly her nature started changing. From Nov 2013, till now. She is becoming more aggressive. Earlier, it wasn't certain what we'll do. Then she said she didn't want to meet me. Now she hates even if I wrote her!


In past two months, I sought so much help from acquaintances and reading on internet. I try to do everything better. In the hindsight, I saw my mistakes being anger and housework. 
I never slapped her, as in, to apply force or to hurt her, but rather to startle, if you understand. 
Still, I understood its bad - its not in my culture, its not what I was taught, its not who I am, and its plain wrong.

I started working on both of them.
Learning to cook, cleaning, things I never liked but I learn because I want to be a Man. A guy who supports his girl.



One week back, we had some talk online.
She was annoyed and everything, asked me to fuck off.
But then I told her: ""Yulia, whatever happens I will become a nice guy like you want(ed). I love you, and I'll become a better person.""

She said: :'-) I believe in you. I wish you become one.


To one of our acquaintances, she wrote THREE days ago, that she didn't have a boyfriend. She said, she loves me, but she doesn't think of rejoining. 
""how abt next boyfriend
have u got sum idea abt it?""
""not at the moment""
""u will b able to luv again?""
""maybe not. 
but there won't be someone to hit me for sure""

""i want to recover
i won't stop loving him. at least at the moment i don't think i can.
but i see that i'm recovering
i see a slight step towards it
i don't want to see him or meet him or talk to him
i'm sure he's not that kind of person
who can communicate with me after break-up""

This acquaintance is a psychiatrist and said that probably Yulia is sort of self-victimizing or something. I don't know.

Same night she wrote -
""I Love You.
Not that it will change something.
Just it will be fair to tell.""


Yesterday we had a talk. I needed to take my travel bag from her place. Firstly I told her: girl, I am ready to do anything in this life for you. She said: not gonna happen. You had your chance.

She didn't want to meet even for 10 seconds. 
And then she told me she has a boyfriend.
Ripped my heart through pieces.

Somehow I am not even able to believe this, but I don't know. She is a sincere girl, and not some casual person, but she also doesn't lie as such.

I talked her online, and she told she has a boyfriend. That within 3 hours from now, I should meet with him at their place. I have tears in my eyes. I have cried everyday since we were separated. I just feel so sad...


I love this girl so so much. She said she loves me. 
But... 

The only good thing is that I don't feel like 'suicide' or something, and want to turn my depression and this pain into energy. I really love her, but I don't know what to do!

Reddit. Please, please help me. Comment, criticize, judge, advice... please.

**Update**

Reddit. My life is fucked.
I had my bag etc at her place. I went to collect it. She also said her new boyfriend wants to meet me.
I went. Her door was locked. I was in freezing -27 C, standing outside. I called her, and she told her door is jammed. She said, her dad will come 'soon'.
Right at that moment, her dad messaged: ""If you ever contact my daughter, I will make problems for you."" Right.
I called her, told her: I need my bag, I am ready to wait. Then I asked if she is alone. She said, of course no!
She said she would throw my bag outside the window. I pleaded her, no! it'll break it. 
2 minutes later.
She said, where are you? I said, why? near your door. 
She said: well, I am throwing your bag, I don't care. Messaged: ""you can collect it :-)""

I collected my bag, lying in the snow. Broken.
More so, a broken heart. 
I thought she told she loves me. Even recently. Two days ago, she said she has no guy.
And today she is with him, sleeping with him. Right.

I am full with feeling of revenge, depression, and just screaming and crying my fucking heart out. I am in this country alone, $248 with myself. Don't know what to do.

1,3,[23/m] and my girlfriend [25/f] left to Egypt to focus on her spiritual life.

I tried to be understanding, I'm a spiritual person too, and the way I see it, she's giving up something she cares about for added focus. Much the same way the muslims give up food doing ramadan.

Anyways that being said it did make me feel lonely and unloved, especially since practically the only time this girl shows affection is in bed, so long distance is extra hard on me. She said I could see other people but that felt empty and shitty so I haven't been doing that. I've started to get a little angry about it, and so a while ago I called her and told her so. I told her I needed her, and felt a little tossed aside like an old dishtowel. I told her if she wants to be with me she should be with me, and if she needs to be alone then we should end it because I can't do this anymore.

She said at first that I should be understanding and not internalize it, that I was being selfish and victimizing myself, but eventually she softened up. At the end of a long talk we agreed that we'll meet up in Egypt in a couple of months and go from there to India together (we both work online and use every opportunity to travel). So I was somewhat comforted.

Then last night I got an email from her saying that she was disturbed by the fact that I needed her, and that we should still meet up in Egypt, but that I should go to India alone to focus more on my spiritual life because I needed to let go of my attachments and focus on my spirituality. 

I haven't answered yet because this pisses me off beyond words. First of all because I've had enough of this long distance shit, and second of all because if I go to India alone I don't want to stop in Egypt. If I should be moving on I should be moving on and not stopping by to open old wounds. I don't think I want to be with her anymore, because it's just become depressing and frustrating, and I'm beginning to feel like if I stay with her it'll just be saying goodbye constantly, and I'd rather be alone than have a halfassed relationship. I can deal with dating, and I can deal with being alone but not this middle ground. What the hell do you guys think I should do?

PS, I know the first thing to come to mind for you guys will be that she's just wanting to fuck some other people, and I want to assure you that's not true. I popped her cherry (when she was 23) and it took me a long time to get her to loosen up sexually. She's kind of a puritan, and I really don't think this is the case.

0,9,Mentally abusive father has stopped giving money to the family. What should I do?,31.0,ass1li,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ass1li/mentally_abusive_father_has_stopped_giving_money/,16.0,1550717384.0," 

So it probably is going to be a long but the story starts from here...

My mother has been married to my father for 27 years and we live in India.

My father has been has always mentally and emotionally abused (though never physically) my mother since their marriage.

He never gave my mother freedom to live by her choice and never provided her with any kind of money. He always threw tantrums and always fought with my mother when she wanted to visit her sisters, her mother or even any of her friends. He never paid for the interior design of our house. It was all done by my mother.

Even though giving minimal amount of money for groceries, he never bought my mother anything and my mom had always had to beg for the essentials of the house. She started her own interior design freelance after that.

It was all mental torture for my mother until she decided to cut off from my dad permanently 3-4 years ago when my father started asking money from my mom because she was earning well.

As we live in India it is very difficult even talking about divorce.

As me and my brother got older(both 20 & 25) we understood more and more about the struggles of our mom.

My father cut off paying for bills 3-4 years ago and only pays electricity, maintenance bill of the home and the mortgage of the house.

All other bill payment responsibilities fell on my mother's shoulders and she is now struggling month by month to pay it.

My father gave me money monthly for my college and my education fees until yesterday when he threw dry waste on my mom because my mom picked up alcohol bottle from the dustbin and kept it on his table ( yeah he drinks everyday).

I confronted him about this and we had this huge fight.

Today he has cut off my monthly travel expenses and threatened to cut off everything. He debited everything from the account.

What can I do? What is the way forward for my mother, brother (earns decently through job but still not that much to be independent) and me?",2019.0,2.0,21.0,08:34:44,victim
2,45,"Please help, my family is contemplating suicide",212.0,f1nyry,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f1nyry/please_help_my_family_is_contemplating_suicide/,62.0,1581355682.0,"I come from a family of four where I'm the eldest child and I have a younger brother (19) who is diagnosed with severe autism. He also has problems with his knees, so he can't walk properly and uses the wheelchair.

I'll explain the background about my brother. He was diagnosed at the age of 2 where he couldn't show signs of speech (a major red flag). The doctors advised my parents to give him therapy for improvement. We admitted him to special schools, brought in special needs teacher, etc. He did home schooling for some time but the improvement was nil. He always got stuck on numbers and basic three and four lettered words. By the time he turned 13, he threw tantrums about not wanting to be schooled by tearing notebooks, screaming and breaking pencils. My parents stopped teaching him after that, seeing that there was no room for improvement. Add to the fact that the involved professionals were only focused on getting paid well and not focusing on quality and improvement of the boy. The only good thing to consider is the fact that he can understand what we speak, and he shows what he wants by hand gestures (not official sign language). Since he grew up with me till I moved to another city for college, he behaved properly and acted in a way that was acceptable to (at least) us. I was very strict and scolded him if he created mischief and trouble for our parents, so he would keep quiet. He also adjusted if we faced any troubles.

Fast forward to today, his violence has gotten worse. By worse, I mean extremely worse beyond imagination. He hits, claws, kicks, throws plastic furniture on my parents. Every kind of physical abuse. Both of them have scars all over their hands. They do hit him back for self defense, but he gets much more abusive and violent. When my parents cry, he laughs at them. He throws groceries, tears clothes, bed sheets, curtains, all kinds of textile, etc. My parents buy them again, only for him to continue this wasteful cycle. Told him time and time again that money doesn't grow on trees but he doesn't care anyway. This is also shameful to write this in a public social media site, but he gazes lustfully at me and my mom and we don't go near him at all. It's disgusting. I know he's my brother, but I can't accept that kind of behaviour displayed to me and my mother. He also indulges in excessive masturbation during midnight (he got caught doing that when we went to check up on him in his room).

I live in another city for work, while the expected logical choice is for me to stay with my family and work from there. That's where the problem lies. Since we both grew up together, he would stay quiet even when I went to school. But now, my parents want me to resign work and stay at home to look after him 24/7. This created a strife within my family because they also suggested similar in the past. They told me to drop college to look after him. I do go home for the holidays and stay for some time. He sits quietly while I am at home and watches TV. However, if he ever tries to raise a hand on my parents knowing front of me, I hit him. I am perfectly aware that what I'm doing is participating in abuse but I cannot just sit quietly and let my parents get beaten like that. He was the one who started this first. Sometimes I take leave outside the holidays but I cannot take leave too often. I need to work because we have financial issues to deal with too.

Since the holiday season is over, me returning here somewhat boosted his abusive behaviour even more. He attacks my parents for talking, sneezing, coughing, etc. He only wants silence and on top of that, he expects this ridiculous cycle of his to be followed every single day without any objections:

-Dad should cook breakfast, go to office, come back home for lunch, buy restaurant food, got back to office return home in the evening and cook dinner.

-Mom should only cook lunch. Vegetable chopping should be done in front of him. But he will eat only restaurant food for lunch and of there's a favourite dish of his, home cooked food also included in his plate.

-No leftovers must be remaining. They all go into the trash.

-He will only watch sexual content shown on music channels on TV. If any educational or news content was running, he'd glare, get up and hit my parents.

-He pees and poops in his pants on purpose to see my parents suffer. A baby would be better in this regard because it learns. My brother is only regressing at this point and is worse than an animal.

Additionally speaking, we have relatives in name only. My parents' relatives and friends ostracized us from their circles and treat us like unwanted beings. Even my friends chose me as a target for them to bully because I have a brother like this and didn't try to understand and support me (except in college and work). What's so wrong about a challenged person? They're human beings too, they just need more special care and attention. Our neighbours drag their children and run away from us as if we're the Addams family. It's not like autism's contagious. Those people running away at the sight of us know this too. Relatives only tried to take advantage of us but we didn't relent so they resorted to slander and humiliation since they weren't able to successfully scam us using this boy as an excuse. As a result, we're really isolated from the rest of the world. We have no one to help us at all.

Now it has escalated to the point that my parents are thinking of committing suicide. I literally shouted at them after hearing this. I can't keep my cool. Very often I told them to take them to a new therapist but that suggestion falls on deaf ears. Also suggested them to admit him to an institute but they don't want to because they think he will die or get killed from neglect. There's a limit to spoiling him. It's because of the past experience where the professionals only took money and didn't really do anything to improve him. I know I've written some mean things about him but I hate him now. I hate him for the fact that he's abusing my parents and making all of us helpless. I hate how he enjoys making us suffer.

Trust me, I even was about to call the police to come and take him away but before I could do that my parents stopped me. My friends are telling me not to go home too often because that would lead to give up on my career. I am stuck between continuing my career and looking after my family. To my parents, the only solution to control his behaviour is for me to give up my job and look after him 24/7. Then why did they make me study? Am I selfish for wanting to do work?

What am I supposed to do now? What is the solution to this problem here? He is showing no signs of changing for the better. He's creating stress for everyone.

TL;DR: Autistic brother abusing my family and I am helpless with the situation. Need a solution to deal with this.

**EDIT1**: Thank you for reading and giving answers and support! I am grateful and right now, I'm looking for a list of institutes for him. Hope my parents agree this time.

**EDIT2**: forgot to mention he had first epilepsy at the age of 12 and the last time he had one was 3 years ago. His abusive behaviour reaches its peak whenever there is a full moon and new moon. We are puzzled as to why this happens and it's not a coincidence. Observations regarding this were made for 1 year.",2020.0,2.0,10.0,23:13:02,victim
5,58,Mom found my joint today. I'm terrified to go home after work,187.0,eiv2ey,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eiv2ey/mom_found_my_joint_today_im_terrified_to_go_home/,138.0,1577978366.0,"So, I made a joint yesterday and when I was packing for my office I misplaced it and went out. But when I checked for the joint and it was not there, I went home again and said I forget my id...mom asked u forget your ID or something else..then she showed me the joint  I made and asked if I planned to smoke it.
I didn't knew what to do and took it from here and flushed it right in front of her.and left home for work....
Now I'm wondering what will be it like when I go home today. I'll try to update tommorow.

Edit 1:
About to reach home.!

UPDATE: 

So, the BIG talk. I kept silence for the most part and listened carefully.before making any assumptions know this> my parents are very simple and humble people. they care about the self image among the society, which is to be fair is not a particularly bad thing.We all are in some way self conscious.Also dad used to smoke cigarette in early days of his service as a sailor(Indian navy) he quit not too long after. So he knows a thing or two about smoking habit.

anyway they gave me a long ranting and few life advises (hard to differentiate at that moment) 

i managed to sum up the conversation in points put forwarded by them.

read them out and try to be rational. we(or i ) don't have to agree with them nor disagree completely


since when were u smoking? : this was a trick question since they have heard rumors (some of them were true) and already suspected that i smoke(till this point only cigarette) but i answered honestly and told them since last year of college which was 2 years back ( it was not the truth but , but before that i only smoked occasionally)

how did they felt about it  : they told me they (papa) were shocked to kno this. since they absolutely hate those who openly smoke/drink ,they didn't expected me to ever indulge such a habit.(i don't smoke in open or in front of strangers ) and told me how disgusted they were knowing there own kid falls in same category.the told me that they could barely eat anything as they were mentally disturbed coz of me.

""Ab hamare jine ka kya mtlb h"" : this was a masterstroke. they made me think that their entire purpose of staying alive was to see me prosper in life but since i have this devilish habit of smoking and drinking (yes i told them about it too....not in details tho. made sure the understand im not a big time drunker and my last time was 7 months ago) i cant prosper or have a healthy/happy lifestyle ( somewhat true to some extent). 

Why I'm being the slave to such degraded act? : i stayed quit for this one. they wanted to kno y im not being able to quit.do i crave for it? will i go to extreme extent to bye/smoke weed anytime in  the future( like a hardcore coke addict do are visualized).

I might show physical retaliation someday.   : they were very sure at first that i will go to the extent of abusing them in order satisfy my craving for the weed(or something else im hiding from them). but i assured them it that wont be true. Also told them about weed effects to which my dear mom pointed out "" yess i have noticed your eyes were red and face swollen many time ( chack mate !/self-gole)."" also told them how common it is among the teenagers now-days( which backfired ).

followed by a question where the fuck i buy this shit from : they did not used those exact words but the feeling was the same. I told them this particular joint was from the very old stash i hid in the home and recently found again. they inquired about where do i found money for this. which lead us to our next segment.

Economics of the addiction : they made many points on how addiction of any kind not only limited to weed or cigarette results in loss of money which in tune could be used for batter issues. they told me about how will it affect my financially and health wise. told me to spend on luxury life-style was still understandable but not this ( we are a middle-class family and hence luxury is something we try to stay away from until and unless it fits in the budget which is mostly low ).

 What if extended family found out? > i hope you all kno how this one went im not gonna explain<

Blamed weed/addiction for every failure in my life: i was never a bright/smart kid, average at everything , could not clear numerous government exams i gave, took more then 5 years to complete 4 years of college, do not have a girlfriend, reducing hairline, my mom said how ugly i look because i have been into this disgraced habits. this i felt on personal level.

Number one reason of broken marriage : yes this one. they are super worried about the impact of this habit upon my future married life. they also raised concerns like , low sperm count(yes we actually had that conversation) ,etc......<i dont wanna talk about it>

They knew about marijuana more then I excepted : they pointed out where they found about weed plant and how often it is available in the wild and where it growes in quantity.(shiv bhakto ki yatra | kavadya ki yatra refrence) but they always will continue to hate it as to them it is same as poison. and its okey. 

Numress reference within society, family: you kno the usual pointing out the examples within our circle.

finally to end the any further discussin i told them 3 (out of 7) of my hiding spots.

AND FINALLY the GRAND PROMISE: i will never do it again.( with my fingured crossed).

so that was it. ill update this update with some final comments/edits.

My friend opened about depression recently. I talked to him and came to know about abusive nature of his family. I was patient and listened to what he had to say.  I am myself diagnosed with anxiety and depression, so I know how tough it is to wake up each day with nothing but loads of negative thoughts in once's head. I want to do the right thing (read below) and need your help guiding me. This community has always paid importance of mental well being and I appreciate you all for it.

1. After he opened about emotional and financial abuse his family is putting him under, I advised him to either cut off completely or if its difficult to go that route, to at least start phasing out their negative anecdotes and only help financially given he is not affecting his own financial well being. Is this advice warranted? Or am I forcing my thoughts about his situation on him, instead of letting him decide what's best for him?
2. As much as I would have appreciated him opening up to me regularly, I simply don't have enough in me to listen to him regularly. It takes a toll on my mental well being, thus I suggested rather talked him into going for a therapy session. Also since he is afraid about opening up to anyone, I made him write his life events so far on a paper and told him to take the paper when he visits therapist. Is my limited emotional availability given just a few days after he opened up to me, the right thing to do? Also is the paper exercise something therapist would like or maybe it's a bad idea?

Thanks to you for reading on up until this point. Please do help me help my friend and communicate your learning from similar situation maybe you were once in.",2020.0,2.0,3.0,12:07:08,victim
7,73,You. Yes!!! It's You. Do it.,65.0,ekjgwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ekjgwb/you_yes_its_you_do_it/,6.0,1578289299.0,"It's high time already! It's so bad that a lurker has to post this. Have always been one, so as to never degrade the content quality of the sub. But, assessing the current political situation has made me impromptu promptly write this.
I'm not here to be a keyboard warrior by bashing the fascist leader and gain karma out of it.
Instead, I'll lay down a plan to tackle the current regime. It only deals with their propaganda power since it has time and again proven that propaganda plays a major role in convincing people to support or commit atrocities. This is the pillar that provides support to the oncoming fascism. Let's BREAK them into pieces. 

1) Since, lack of karma has refrained me from writing things in other subs. As a sound citizen, we need you to get our situation to be heard globally (like the HongKong protest). Henceforth, Fella redditors with high karma and eloquent writing skills. Do post articles, videos, engage in group discussions happening in global subs like world news, Politics and many more. Subs that has their presence in the front page.
Use your meme knowledge, post and repost memes to subs like memes, dank meme, meme economy and so on.

2) WhatsApp is the breeding ground for BJP propaganda. Inorder to counter this, we need you to post videos highlighting the hypocrisy of this party. Especially the ones that OFFICIAL PEEING HUMAN uploads. Tweet him asking for an offline download link of his vidoes. Or do download it by illegal means ( anything illegal for greater good is good).
Do not post link to the videos. Mid-life crisis unkills and aunties won't open the link and watch it. Even if they did, not gonna watch more than 5 seconds. They are brainwashed in thinking Modi is the superman that's gonna save their arse from monotonous life. Do not send them to a liberal's den. They identify themselves as Bhakt due to the sheer propaganda and will refute to believe any of it. Hence, remove the doctrine slowly. Administer the truth little by little in their silly heads. Truth is, if they can be brainwashed to an extend that can support this regime without giving any batshit about the trend of the country. They can be rewired to think in the right way as well. Sharing offline videos in WhatsApp groups will definitely make them watch it accidentally atleat once. Since, they are prone to clicking it on their Phone Gallery.  Apparently,most of them don't care to even delete it later.

You will obviously face criticism from your family, friends and acquaintances by sharing the videos in their WhatsApp Group. Calm your nerves down. Do not engage in a rebuttal with them. Keep posting every hour every day. Things will change. People who blindly supported the party's claims will progressively begin to think about it. They may not change their stand an overnight, a week, a month or forever. But will definitely cross think about the situation. And will not start shouting slogans praising this fascist regime.
Do add photos and videos highlighting great leaders,celebrities,experts of any field expressing their opinions. Do quote Golden words said by past leaders and dictators regarding the fascism.
Share pictures of scientific data and statistics highlighting the economic growth, unemployment     trend and so on. 

Might seem like a silly thing to do. But things like these are definitely the ones that pulled them in supporting BJP in the first place.

3) Eloquent writers of this sub. Please Write messages that serves like a WhatsApp forward messages. (You know, like the share with five groups to charge your smartphone to 100%)
Mods, please make an active thread on it. Allow us to copy and share it in the other online medias.
Use your wit and style, to enhance the power of the message. 

DO NOT LABEL an ignorant or a brainwashed mind as a bhakt or sanghi. I trusted Modi by the party's propaganda thinking they did good for the nation. Unlike the mainstream propaganda, I fell prey to the pretentious Quoran who bags the number one place in followers count. He sold lies without telling lies. He never lied about the policy and regulations government made. Instead, he bent and twisted the facts in favour of the party. He sold hopes after every failure of the government's action. He's a prime example of an educated moron. He highlights the fact that an educated mind is not equivalent as an intellect's mind.
Sorry it turned into a rant.
Wanted y'all to know,how a budding mind like mine fell to his black magic. His educational credentials is what makes growing and educated minds fall for such propaganda trap. If I hadn't stumbled upon this platform, I would've remained a Bhakth even now. 

Change starts from your home. Don't involve in a verbal abuse or quarrel with your hardcore right wing conservative family,if they are one. Instead, keep mumbling about the country's situation then and now like a casual talk.
Let their mind process it.
Educate them about history like How Hitler rose to power and how our country is trying to be the 1930's Germany.

Unlike the Nazi's  who had control over the media back then i.e the newspapers and Radio which was and is only one-sided where the true mind couldn't express the truth. Our generation is blessed enough to have countless online presence and mode of communication is much easier and two sided.

Brainwash the minds into thinking right.

Do not outcast them into a different sect. This will only create chaos. Their sadness will be disguised in the form anger. This will make them loathe our ideologies and ultimately send them into the deep pit of what propaganda machines dug.

Rather,listen to their side and make them understand. I don't know how many of the downvoted answers/ comments were genuinely by people who just needed to hear the other side of the story aka the true and filtered one.
If they are hell bent on being a bhakth,just ignore them. 

You know,brain is a fragile thing. It's shaped by the things that it's surround itself with.

4) Post Documentaries, articles, paragraphs from well renowned books about our world history or anything that seems relevant to the current cause

Fellow redditors be ready to smash the upvote buttons in sending them to the front page. 

It's far-off better than highlighting tweets or images that creates only segregation in the society.

Let's walk the path of Ahimsa and Truth.

""In a gentle way, you can shake the world.""
""Whenever you are confronted with an opponent, conquer him with love.""- M.K Gandhiji

""Peace  cannot be built on exclusivism, absolutism, and intolerance. But neither can it be built on vague liberal slogans and pious programs gestated in the smoke of confabulation. There can be no peace on earth without the kind of inner change that brings man back to his 'right mind'.""

First of all my DMs are open to talk vent or rant. Long post but hopefully you’ll find some inspiration at the end of it.

- I dropped out of engineering myself, you can check my post history to a couple of years or so ago. I dropped out of engineering in my third year at pretty good college. Restarted it in my second year when my parents refused to fund any other discipline of education. I did my engineering at a shit private college. I was sad and depressed too and all I did was come home, sleep, pass the day, etc. fast forward to today, I’ve spent a year at top 3 International university after being invited, and I’m heading to Estonia for my masters, completely free and even a decent stipend to take care of my expenses there. It was a long journey, but I struggled like the rest of you. 


- **To all of you who are depressed, unmotivated and in bed all day, I would recommend doing something as simple as taking a shower**. A warm/cold shower (however you prefer) is so underrated and can help you just get ready enough to do do something more, or at least get you out of bed. There have been so many times that my feeling of ‘bleh what a day’ turned around after a shower.


- **Cut out the porn and the jerking off. It’s going to push you into a deeper hole without making you realise that it’s happening at all**.
Masturbation is fine, so is porn. Just don’t indulge to pass the time is all.


- **Small achievements can go a long way. Try and learn how to make a nice omelette for yourself. Re-arrange your cupboard maybe? Re-order your bookshelf? Clean the dirt off your shoes? Water your plants? Any of these is something positive you did for yourself or your household. Congratulations. **


- Depression is very complicated, so there’s no fix all solution as there are infinite reasons that can lead you to this road. I’m going to try and address those who feel unproductive or feel they can’t do much professionally or education wise:

- **A lot of the times, we get depressed because of conflict in fulfilling what’s expected of us and what we actually want to do, my only advice is this: Everyone dies**. **Yes, taking up a job which isn’t mainstream might seem embarrassing in the moment, maybe your parents are upset or worst case disown you. But we’re talking about getting you out of the mindset to take your life or wasting it away.**
**You may push yourself to do something that people/parents or society want but not you, then everyone will die, and you’ll be stuck with your choice for 30-40 years, unhappy. **
I’d rather you risk 5-7 years of discomfort, take a risk, or start at the bottom somewhere and grow and learn. Get beyond the confines of the education system if you suck at it. Live life on your own terms. 

- Also, It helps no one if you want to be a high paid exec but spend your day binging Brooklyn 99 or reruns of Big Bang Theory. __Either adjust your dreams to your effort or your effort to your dreams. A disconnect will only get you down further.__

- Story time: A friend of mine, girl, ran away from her house after she was verbally and physically abused by her family for not getting a job. She was 23 at that time. She had around 19k in savings, walked around and found a job as a night desk attendant after a week in a local chain hotel reception. She managed to find a place to stay with 5 other people in a very (VERY) small flat, so she could pay less rent, she ate shit food and lived in shit conditions, but she learned and grew on the job, by waiting tables and cleaning and doing additional duties. She grew and now she’s managing the hotel and running a bar owned by the owner of the chain on her own and earning more than most people I know at 28-29. This woman would call me almost everyday depressed and crying, to see her where she is now makes me very happy.

- **So yeah, her family hated her, her relatives hated her for being a receptionist** and a dishwasher and a waitress, she risked A LOT for 6-7 years, but she decided to work her ass off out of that situation. 

- **Doing productive work isn’t too hard. You just need some momentum. Try and have no zero days. If you’ve got a shit ton of work piled up, resolve to do some portion of it.**

- Do enough that the future you (of tomorrow, of next week, of next month) can thank the past you for being an awesome bro/sis and doing your part of the load. So no zero productivity days. Feel free to DM. 

**PS: Redditors can at the very most sympathise with you and tell you that everything is going to be okay. Very few would be more generous than words of support. Everyone will move on with their life and in the end, it’s only you and your hustle. Solution takes time and you’ll probably be out of the rut, but it’ll take time. Be patient.**

12,126,Indian parents forcing me to break up/giving me daily anxiety attacks - please help!,91.0,amy7xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/amy7xu/indian_parents_forcing_me_to_break_upgiving_me/,91.0,1549284879.0,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

This is going to be a super long post but I really really need some help here. Let me start with the explanation of my situation first:

&#x200B;

I'm an Indian girl who was raised in the Middle East, so I had a pretty non-conservative upbringing. I've always seen my family as progressive - putting my education and my career above all else, being able to major in what I want to, my parents being okay with me identifying as atheist. I'm currently 24 (25 this year), and finishing up my first year in my Master's program in the US - I did my undergrad here too. However, between my undergrad and grad I moved home for about two years, which is where I met and started dating who I consider to be the love of my life.

&#x200B;

He's my first boyfriend, yes, but we started dating at age 23 and have a pretty mature relationship, while not taking ourselves too seriously. Before meeting him, I was recovering from a pretty horrible emotionally abusive fwb situation. I've also been diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. My parents know about my diagnosis, but they don't really believe in it - I had a pretty ugly argument with them about my former suicide attempt (because my fwb attempted to sexually assault me, which of course I didn't tell them about because no sex before marriage). Since I've met my boyfriend, however, I've become more confident in myself and can deal with my issues better and in a healthier way (aka not resorting to alcohol or self-harm anymore). I like what I've grown into since I met him.

&#x200B;

Now here's my issue:

1. My boyfriend will be starting his Master's program this year, at age 25. I'll finish one year before he does. My parents believe that 27 is the ""right age"" to get married, but at 27 he would just be graduating so his situation won't be completely stable at that point. They think 28 is ""too late"".
2. My parents have a friend who had complications in her pregnancy at age 30, so they want me to have kids before that - even though I have no interest in kids until I'm in my 30s.

So basically, even though they claim to like him, they've been cold towards him from the beginning. When I was home for winter break, they had a 3-hour long talk with me where they straight-up told me we can't get married. They want me to break up with him by May, and then meet someone ""older and settled"", and then get married to him IN TWO YEARS' TIME.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend and I have spoken about it, and we want to be together and get married. He knows all about my parents and I know he'll stay and fight, but I hate it. I hate that my parents won't accept us, I hate that my boyfriend is getting hurt by this, and I hate the insane amount of pressure on me. Don't I get a say in my own life? When I told them I didn't wanna break up with him, my dad basically threatened to call his dad and get our engagement fixed. We wanna do it at our pace!

&#x200B;

I've always been close to my family but now I dread talking to them on the phone, I dread bringing him up, and I'm dreading seeing them in person next. I don't want to lie to them but I don't know what to do. They refuse to listen to reason, they refuse to listen to the fact that I love him and I want to spend my life with him. They refuse to acknowledge that I'm an adult and that I can make my own decisions - ESPECIALLY about someone I want to spend the rest of my life with. They say love marriages are okay ""but not with him"". They refuse to accept the fact that I'm okay with getting married at an older age, and that I don't want children until I'm older.

My anxiety levels are at an all-time high. Until recently I was underweight and managed to gain weight when I was home, but now I can barely bring myself to eat most days. I throw up everything I eat because of the stress, I can barely sleep at night. I randomly start crying for absolutely no reason, and I'm not a crier. I'm going to class and killing myself to maintain my 4.0 GPA (which is another requirement of theirs) while working 20 hours a week at my job. I'm pretty sure I'm going through a depressive episode. I've tried contacting mental health services but no one has gotten back to me yet - it's been a month since I first called them. I haven't hurt myself in years but I keep thinking about it now, and I'm really scared I'll act on it.

I did my engineering in something which i didn't love very much, got the branch and it too late to undo the mistake. I wanted  to work with computers but my branch wasn't exactly made for that, neither i could afford one to learn and look for jobs in IT. If it wasn't for the scholarship, I couldn't have afford to pay the fees for college. 

I thought ok and I'll look for jobs through government exams and ibps since I didn't really like working as someone from a core branch anymore and what could lift my family out of poverty other than a stable job which they offered. 

Fast forward 4 years later, I still haven't gotten a job. I can't look for jobs based on my degree because of the 4 year gap and I don't remember shit I studied.

And there comes my alcoholic and abusive father in picture, who acts supportive for one day and then gets drunk everyday, curses me and won't let me eat or sleep or study. This has been going on since last 4 years and I've been only tolerating, hoping one day I'll get out this shithole. My mental health has been shit and I've thought about taking my life everyday but it won't do anyone good. I've lost weight, It's barely above 50 and i can't eat more than 4 rotis in a day. I don't feel hungry anymore and every idiot who comes home says ""wHy DoNt YoU EaT, YoU LoOk LikE SkeLeTon"".

Now my father don't even need to be drunk to fight and curse everyone at home and blames us for his failures which he has been doing since last 24 years. It has gotten worse and I'm not sure I can survive this any longer. I can't even leave home because I don't have money or anywhere to go. I feel clueless about what I should do.

I was hoping to buy a computer and learn being a front end web developer and look for relevant job, hoping they won't care about the long gap. And data is also affordable now and there are lots of websites who help you learn for free but my broke ass hasn't been able to afford a get a cheap working computer or neither I'll ever get any support from home.

18,163,Bad tenant story,6.0,au0lt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/au0lt2/bad_tenant_story/,14.0,1550987575.0,"Hello randians,

Just remembered this story that happened 3 years ago. 

My dad has been renting out an apartment in Delhi since 2005.He is always careful about the choice of tenants (young families, educated bachelors, etc.. you get the gist).  In 2015 he rented out the apartment to this young guy from Chennai. Good paying job, recently married with one child. Basically as secure as it can get in terms of a tenant. 

At the end of a year, the tenant had to move due to professional obligations and gave the standard 2 month notice.
Except that the day that he was supposed to check out, he requested us my dad to come in at 2 pm for the apartment verification but suddenly called him in the morning and told my dad that he had to leave earlier as the movers were in a hurry. He said also “I’ve tried my best to clean everything but there is some minor damage. Please be gentle “
Since he seemed like a trustworthy guy, my dad agreed and said that he will do the apartment check at 2 pm as agreed and inform the tenant in case of any damage.

Now, I always helped out my dad with managing this part of the renting.  When I entered the apartment, I was shocked with the state of the apartment. The tenants child had scribbled all over the walls, drawers in the kitchen and bedroom were damaged, the kitchen shelves had not been cleaned for a year and were swarming with cockroaches and there were cobwebs and ants everywhere in the house. The utility area had 2 feet of water piled up due to a leaky washing machine which was now swarming with dead cockroaches and rat shit.
I called up a cleaning agency who put the estimate at 35,000 for cleaning up the place and painting the walls.

When I finally called up the tenant to inform him of the damage, he lost his cool,said he was being cheated, abused me with a collection of colorful swear words and hung up. Over the next 2 weeks, I tried to be reasonable with the tenant, I shared the photos of the damage, the bills shared by the cleaning agency and also the explanation on how i was forced to spend my personal time on making sure all this was done since no other tenant would want to rent this apartment in the current state. Each time I got a response of being called a cheat and further threats of legal notice.

Finally, fed up with this arguing, I consulted a lawyer friend who advised me that I was in the safe (considering I had documented the damage with photos and  dates, the tenant in the mails had agreed to the damage, plus the bills I shared were reasonable and were not exorbitant). He advised me to go on the offensive and threaten a counter suit asking for damages to cover lost personal time and also harassment by the tenant (the mails with the colorful language all played in wonderfully here).

Long story short, after my threat to file a counter suit, i got a nice apology mail from the tenants wife and she also was in agreement to the amount to be deducted.  The matter was closed in a days time.

So, dear randians, share with me your horror stories of the worst tenants !

19,169,"A Housemaid's Colony: My father's short story about his time working in Andhra, education at the grassroots level and the ups and downs of Indian life in general",16.0,ar1kgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ar1kgn/a_housemaids_colony_my_fathers_short_story_about/,3.0,1550295259.0,"In RS Rao Nagar, Secunderabad, which is a part of Andhra Pradesh in India, there lies a place called ECIL colony. There are many colonies across the breadth and length of India. So what is so special about this colony? You must be wondering! As usual this was started by one of the quasi-government companies for the convenience of its engineers and senior managers, who were the cream of the elite in the society. Plots were allotted to individual employees and they made houses according to their will and capabilities, sometimes beyond that also.   
Mr.Ram, one of the very first home owners in that colony, who is still staying in his house for most part of the year introduced my good friend and colleague Vishnu, to this place and helped us get a portion of a palatial two storied villa, on rent. He was kind enough to drive us around and show some beautiful places not far from our residence   
I myself and Vishnu, were forced bachelors in Secunderabad as our families were settled in Bangalore. Our fortnightly commute to Bangalore, in Kachiguda express or Gareebrath trains kept us sane, in that country side.  
In the middle of the day, when we checked in to our house everything looked grand and green. We had a housemaid attached house; or it would be right to say we had a housemaid and her family staying at an outhouse, in our compound. She herself, her husband and two kids stay in and look after the house and its garden. So, we were lucky to get her services to maintain our portion of the house also neat and clean.  
The monotonous job routine was made bearable by the entertainment of bachelor cooking and discussions about the stupidity of outdated bosses who still think, bossing is all about putting hurdles on the way of progress of their subordinates. In between Anchamma (our maid) brought her LP School kids for tuition, to us. Although I used to be a professor of Marketing for MBA students, once up on a time, I didn’t feel my ego hurt, to teach those kids. The 6-year-old boy and his 4-year-old sister used to share a small piece of broken pencil and wait patiently for their turns to write. Although I know about poverty and how millions suffer in our homeland, working many years in MNCs abroad, maybe I lost touch with grassroots level reality. It came as a shock to me. I went with my friend and bought some books, pencils, eraser and slates for the kids. Seeing the happiness in their eyes, made me feel like, I won an Oscar. Every evening when we reach home, from job, both kids will be waiting at the door. The boy will salute me, as if we are in the army and the little’ girl will be lurking behind, with a shy smile. We used to share little snacks with those kids, sometimes. I can still see the smiles on their innocent faces, when we keep the food items on their little palms. May be that motivated them to look forward to their study times.

The housemaid’s husband was a smart looking tall man. He is very quiet and she used to order him around and made him do errands around the house. He loved his wife and kids and obeyed all her orders, as if she is his mother. In the evenings he used to come drunk and some times make a scene. She scolds him and to vent her anger sometimes beat her children. In the mornings when she come to clean our house, we used to tell her, please don’t beat the kids; they are too small. They have no one else, but you to protect them. Her eyes well up with tears and she says, we have no money and whatever I save he spent on drinks; how else can I show my anger?   
Most mornings, before starting to the factory, me and Vishnu will do yoga, on the vast balcony or I will go to gym, with my junior colleague Venkat, who was staying nearby. I was always a fitness freak. Venkat is the only one among my friends, who is more obsessed than me, about fitness. I am glad to let you know that, he has graduated in to an Ironman, triathlon enthusiast. Every evening Vishnu will put on his tape recorder, with old Hindi songs and sing along. That was our major entertainment. I used to strum on my old guitar, when I am alone. Although, I love the instrument and very passionate about all types of music, I was never good at it, to play in front of anyone.   
Mr.Ram, our well-wisher, used to drop in sometimes and give us good advises. In the third week of the month he dropped in, late evening and asked us, where do we sleep. We told him, that this job we are considering as a stopgap arrangement and do not want to do any long-term investments there. Hence, we just had our beds and some mats. He told, no, no, that’s not good. You should have a cot at least. I have some good quality wooden cots at home. You can take that; we are not using them anyway. Its solid teak wood etc. We told him, we do not need cots. If we need, we will buy later. But he insisted and we couldn’t say no to his loving persuasion. Thus, we both got a cot each, from him. He even helped us to carry them to our home. We were surprised that, still there are some good human beings.  
On 30th of the month, we got our salaries, did some grocery shopping, had a discounted dinner at Subway, as they had half price offer for Paneer sub. on Mondays. When we reached home, Mr.Ram was standing at the gate, with a beaming face. He commented, it looks like my new neighbours got their salaries today. We happily confirmed that and invited him for a cup of tea.  
During our tea, he told, “Young men (although we were not that young), you can pay me for the cots, you bought from me; anyway, you got your salaries now.  
We looked at each other, in dis-belief. Hesitantly Vishnu asked him, “Sir, how much we have to pay you? we do not have a problem, we were going to ask you”. He said, “You can pay me well; they are very good wood. New ones will cost a fortune. Pay me Rs.4000/- each”. We had shock of our lives; we never asked him for that. He only insisted and gave us, as if it’s a free gift. It’s of course useful. But such an old piece should cost only a small percentage of what he asked. Anyway, we paid him what he asked. But we knew well, that we were taken for a ride, very artistically.

On Sunday mornings Vishnu will make breakfast, after yoga. Mostly it will be Upma and when the water starts boiling, he will shout, “Anjamma ……..curry leaves”. The maid will pluck fresh curry leaves, from her kitchen garden and come running or send it with one of the kids.   
Our neighbouring house was very noisy on weekends. The housemaid there and her husband usually sleep in the small room outside the kitchen. As we are staying on the first floor, we can see all the happenings around. And in the weekends their friends (maids and their husbands from nearby houses) gather there and they takeover the house completely. Drinking and all types of fun and frolicking takes place.  
Once we saw the maid and her husband of our neighbouring house was fighting with each other. The man was shouting at his wife, “Why the hell the old goose and the fat pig coming back, to disturb us? Now I have to find a place to stay for my nephew.  
The lady was pacifying him saying, “Do we have a choice? Its their house. They will be here only for a couple of months. Then they will go back. We will adjust somehow.” We were wondering, what is happening and didn’t had a clue, what they are talking about.

Eventually we realized that most of the houses are occupied by housemaids and their families. The owners of the house are old people, who are in Germany, US or Australia. They were all highly placed managers, who spent most of their lives savings to make their kids Engineers and doctors, who went to universities abroad and eventually settled at their places of job. The parents were asked to join them for deliveries of their daughters or daughters in law and to look after their kids. Once in a while when the parents couldn’t stand the hard work and abuse or crave for some privacy and to see their friends and relatives back home, they are sent on parole. At that time only the houses are occupied by the real owners. Most of the occupants are care takers and when they stay for longer duration, they assume that they own the houses and expect that the owners never will come back. If they ever comeback, it becomes a nuisance for them.   
I remember, during our Gulf days, many friends, who stayed as bachelors for different reasons, used to say sadly, we all are vending machines. We have to keep sending money to our wife and kids. We will starve and save all the money and buy all sorts of gifts and carry home, when we get leave. The lucky ones go once a year and the not so lucky ones go once in 3 or 4 years.  
Wife and children love their visits and enjoy the gifts and funds transfer. But if they overstay, everyone starts murmuring, when will he go back? What a headache, wife cannot go shopping with friends, children cannot come home late. Frequent movies and trips with friends are restricted. Its not that they don’t love him; but they are used to the freedom and the entertainments that the monthly funds transfer bring. But this loving husband/father is outdated and has old school values. Its difficult to stand that for longer.  
May be the homemade and family are grateful that they got the job and the security that comes with it. But the freedom that they enjoyed in the absence has gone to their heads and they took it as a right. And the poor house owners who paid their salaries without fail became a nuisance. Everyone thinks about own happiness and freedom and don’t have the inclination or time, to think about the ones, who’s efforts they are enjoying.

The last news I got about our Secunderabad neighbourhood was that, Mr.Ram, who arranged the accommodation for us was discarded by his kids, who were settled abroad and is now languishing in an old age home, somewhere. His wife was lucky to die before that. What a tragic end to a highly educated individual, who was a responsible father, husband and a good human being. India and Indians lost many things, in the so-called progress and quest to copy the Westerners. But the most tragic loss is the loss in values of family and social relationships. I personally feel, we copied only the negative aspects of western life.  
I sometimes wonder, what those two little kids grew to become. Hope they made it big in their lives. Maybe I should go back and see them one day. The biggest take away from my Hyderabad sojourn is friendship with two great human beings, Vishnu and Venkat, which I hope, will last till my last days.  
How many people pass through our lives, at different phases; some of them leaves a mark in our hearts, some remain as a lingering pain, some as a pleasant memory. But all those people and the little emotions they create in gives meaning to our lives.",2019.0,2.0,16.0,11:19:19,victim

It's frustrating as I have to report them as spam everytime and each time it's a new number. 

Today however, I was left a voicemail by a certain Mark with a clear desi accent. I was really upset at this point and called the number back and abused him with the most foul Hindi words. He sounded a bit hesitant but was trying to keep up. I hung up and he called me again. Back and forth again and then I hung up. I felt very bad for what I did, angry at someone just doing his job albeit not worth doing.

This time I called him and sincerely apologized for my outburst. He said it's ok and apologized too. I told him it's not him that I am personally angry against and also told him to find a respectable job. He said ""nahi mil raha.."". It was heartbreaking so I told that he and I are perhaps the same age, and we both are doing what we do to support our daily existence and our family and it's nothing to be ashamed of. I told him to instead put his hard work, on anything other than this soul sucking job. Told him to be brave and not feel bad about himself. There was a silence where I think he was crying. I asked him sorry again. He couldn't tell me where he was from. 

I really felt bad and I feel what he must be going through. I wish our system groomed bold, brave and strong personalities rather than pushing youngsters into the 20s with burdening responsibilities and terrible jobs such as these call centers offering loans to folks abroad.

I honestly feel like I lived most of my life just trying to get by, you know where nothing stimulates yor brain and you watch life just passing by in front of you. I don't feel the need to do something and  my primary goal for the day is to go through with it, come home and go to bed. 

I am very introverted, and with that very shy. My parents have had some serious issues from the very beginning of their marriage. Apparently my mum tried to poison herself because of the torture given by my grandmother. There were fights, big ones even if they were triggered by the stupidest of issues. All of this took a toll on me and I don't know what exactly happened. I completely got shut off and I couldn't be like other kids. I used to struggle in Maths, no matter how much I tried to get better at it. I have also observed that I don't have good cognitive abilities to properly function, like a dumb silent kid who is just there with the crowd. 

I initially thought it was ADHD but I didn't do anything about it. So many years of my life, struggling to understand and comprehend simple concepts, school wise and otherwise. I struggled to even calculate tender change and splitting of money. Anything related to reasoning and logical, I would be very bad. I don't know how to explain this but my mind couldn't follow basic instructions and infer from them. 

As a result of my non participating, I did not have friends. Nobody could see what was happening to me and I could have used some help. Between all of this happening at school and home, I did not know whom to ask for help. I was sexually abused by two people for about two to three years. I did not realise what was going on, but I sometimes did enjoy it. 

Now that am adult, I am struggling to keep my life together. I am a very average looking guy with average skills and I am not making enough progress career wise, I would say no progress at all. My parents still fight to this day. They are great parents nevertheless, I love them very dearly. 

With all the shit I am dealing on my own, I have to deal with them too that makes me even more depressed. I still have nobody to talk to. My mum says why should she be in the house with them fighting all the time and especially when I am not going to get married and bring a daughter in law and our kids in to the household (I am gay btw and they know it) They still haven't completely accepted me and are in the hopes of me changing my mind. My mother brings the marriage issue everytime in a conversation. I just smile and shake it off but internally I feel crushed. With the insecurity I have not been tried to have a relationship with anyone. I have stopped trying to find someone altogether. 

All I wanted was mom and dad to be happy. Every waking minute of my life is dedicated for that. But I think I am losing the battle. I try so much to not think about suicide, seriously I have no skills and getting shit pay, I am not attractive and I am too shy with obscenely low level of confidence. 
I see all my friends who studied in the same class as me, travel the world and working for apple and Twitter and Amazon. And here I am who cannot even write a proper program to save the life of me.  

I am trying so hard to get better, trying to relearn everything that I have learned, picking some skills, exercising. But I am also fighting this feeling that wants me to kill myself. I really wish I could do. 

I am sorry if this post annoyed you but I thought I could share something so personal anonymously and try to get some off my chest. ",2018.0,1.0,9.0,22:49:21,victim

My cousin sister lost her parents early but very fortunately had been in a happy marriage. She lives at her in-laws hometown 500 kms away. 3 years back her deceased dad's brother(very shady AH) requested her to take a loan on his behalf. She met a local lender through a neighbor, and got him the loan in her name. It was for an amount for about 3 lakhs. This uncle had no security and the lender gave the amount only because this neighbor convinced her that the BIL's family is very respectable in that area. The uncle paid the interest on it for a year. He borrowed another 4-5 lakhs from the lender to start a business making the capital 8 lakhs. The business did well but few months later he had a heart attack and was unable to pay any interest. The lender threatened to expose the loan to my sister's husbands family. That would destroy her life so sis contacted all her friends(mostly NRI) to cough up the interest payments. She did this for 1.5 years paying exorbitant amounts to the tune of 20 lakhs. By this time, the crook uncle kept telling her he had financial issues, would barely send any money. All this time, he ensured he sent his daughter to study in an upscale college for graduation/post-graduation, while he and his wife led a lavish lifestyle(double-door fridge, leather furniture, AC, inverter, etc)

I have no clue how my sister pulled all this off but a few months back, she was on the verge of suicide. Her friends intervened and made her inform her husband. Thankfully, BIL is somewhat level-headed and wants to do the right thing, so he reached out to the few trustworthy relatives from her side, which is how I came to know the story. BIL called the uncle and told him to take responsibility for the loan. I went with my sis, BIL, uncle to meet the lender. The lender spoke very politely to us(since BIL is now involved) and said she herself borrowed the amount from several others, and those folks want to keep the loan(promissory note) in my sisters name only. She wouldnt relax the rates of interest either. Sis/BIL/uncle paid the interest for 2 more months. In the meantime we all met to figure out how much interest the uncle has to give back to my sis. Here is where the uncle and aunt backed off - they virtually absconded from here. I and relatives tried our best to get this couple to the negotiating table but in vain.

BIL contacted this uncle's business contacts and told them the full story. It seems that this uncle had cheated a few of his business contacts as well and owes them money - 5 lakhs here, 3 lakhs there etc. At this point, BIL just lost it - he blasted the uncle through whatsapp and text, calling him asshole/criminal/etc, demanded that he comes to talk. Sis and BIL kept in touch with his business partner, trying to work out how to handle the mess. (BIL's family has good contacts but he cant share this problem as it will totally destroy sis' face in his house)

Around this time, my sisters boss gave us the contact of the local inspector. BIL called the lender, discussed all the transactions and turned in the audio to the police. The police agreed it was illegal of the lender to collect so much. Sis/BIL made it clear they wont pay a penny more to the lender. Since sis did not get a penny from the lender(everything sent to the uncle), the lender cant sue her now for the capital(thats what we think). The lenders husband and MIL had blasted her for getting into the lending business(this was conveyed to us by that neighbor) so there is little chance of her harassing/suing my sister. Issue #1 solved!

Issue #2 was to get the uncle to sign an agreement that he owes my sister 20 lakhs in interest payments, since her friends are now asking her. Sis filed a complaint on him and the police called him and the lender for discussion. At this point, the uncle complained to the police in his hometown that BIL was ""torturing"" him through phone. The inspector called my BIL, who met the inspector and told the whole story. BIL signed a letter saying he wouldnt contact the uncle henceforth and the complaint was closed. The uncle then visited the inspector in my BIL's hometown(where the complaint was made). He was asked to come back with bank statements and the lender was informed as well. The objective was to find out how much he has to pay back my sis.

For the past month, the uncle has been telling the police that he is sick, unwell and postponed the date 4 times. My sis and BIL are at a loss what to do here. They tried to make a settlement with the police since going to court will take ages but the criminal is refusing to come citing poor health. My questions:

* If the police were to make him come, will they need the complaint turned into an FIR?
* If FIR, will the issue become full blown legal and out of police hands? Here the proof of my sisters payments rest with the lender producing bank statements(since only 8 out of the 20 lakhs was online transfer). If it becomes a court case, this will involve bringing in the lender to produce proofs, which is even more complicated.
* Can the uncle file back FIR of cyber-abuse against my BIL, even though the police complaint was dismissed? This could make things even more messy and prolonged.
* The only reason they are looking at a police settlement is to bring closure, as they desperately need the guy to send them some amounts to pay back friends. And they need to carry on raising their small kids.


TLDR: Sister's uncle and aunt borrow 8 lakh as capital(proof available) which wasnt paid back. My sis paid around 20 lakhs of interest(borrowed from friends) to the lender. The only proof of her payments are with the lender which lender is unlikely to produce. She has admitted the interest rates in a phone conversation for which sis has the audio. Sis filed a petition with the police. The police called the uncle to sign an agreement promising to pay her back, but he claims the interest cant be 20 lakhs. The police asked the lender to come with her bank statements, and the uncle to come and sign up a payment plan. Uncle is not coming saying he is ill.",2018.0,2.0,6.0,20:35:26,victim

I searched for answers on the internet, and found many conflicting studies on whether alcohol is good or bad. It seems that as long as one doesn't get addicted it won't be a problem. But hearing news

I don't want to come across as the timid ""good guy"" or as an uncultered pleb in-front of my coworkers. Are there any benefits to drinking other than a perceived pleasure you would get when you are drunk? Would I miss out on anything if I don't drink?

Mobile. 

Some key background information: Before I started at my current customer service position one year ago, I worked directly with child sex abuse victims and their families. Abuse advocacy will always define my politics and morals. I am a survivor and am close to survivors. My best friend of 7 years, who is also my boss (we both started here at the same time) is also a survivor. We tell each other everything.

Helpful abbreviations: BBF = boss best friend, OB= old boss who recently transferred departments, “Lev” = new coworker. 

Honestly, I am not sure where to start because there is a lot to unpack. 

Lev started in our department with a cohort of all new customer service representatives. OB was in charge of the hiring process, so we did not know anything about the new group’s backgrounds before they started. Lev immigrated to the United States 20 years ago to attend university in our city (BBF and I’s alma mater). He worked in California as a school counselor for 10ish years, then moved back to City. BBF, me, and the whole department agrees that he is the sweetest guy ever, and he is kicking butt at his job. He has nothing but nice things to say about everyone and everyone has nothing but nice things to say about him. 

Lev was rear-ended early last week and when he couldn’t get a ride with the other new rep, “Pete”, on Monday, I offered to drive. He spent over an hour on the bus Monday with no complaints, but he lives close and I figured carpooling would help me be more punctual in the mornings while also paying forward some kindness. 

Yesterday when I drove him to and from work, he has told me about his life, wanting to settle down and start dating, how close he is to family, God, and believes the most important thing in life is honesty and not bottling up feelings. He doesn’t smoke or drink. Dude seems pure as snow. Coincidentally, my friend who is closer in age to him, has been asking me if I know any singles, so I told her about Lev. She asked if he had a Facebook, so I googled him.

What I find is the last thing I expected. 

Several news articles about how he was kidnapped, tortured, and forced to leave his home country due to his job as a political journalist as part of a UN asylum program. Heartbreaking to read about my kind coworker. 

Then it got worse. 

He is on the National Sex offender registry for 288(c) in California. Basically, child molestation with a child between 14-15 by an adult 10 years or older. It is a lifetime registry. Looking at the dates, it seems to be the same time as he was a school counselor. 

I immediately sent the links to BBF and we talk through our emotions from the shock. Lev and I are the only ones scheduled to work late on Wednesdays, and BBF arranged for me to switch. We have a casual work relationship with OB so we messaged him... he had no idea, about any of it. 

Now I am sitting 5 feet away from Lev’s usual cheery, complimenting, and seemingly pure self. I feel kind of sick. While OB, BBF, and I staunchly support a reformative justice system, conscientious of biases against immigrants, etc... we all think it is best if I do not continue offering rides. It is a lot to process in a short period of time. I have never (knowingly) worked directly with a child sex offender. Because of my background, I am reacting more strongly to this than I did with other coworkers I know with criminal pasts. I also feel conflicted due to him being a victim of violence himself.

How do I process this? What is the best way to get out of providing rides without tipping him off that I know about his past? What is the best way to feel comfortable at work?",2020.0,2.0,20.0,08:48:24,victim
1,39,My friend (33F) is going to get murdered by her ex-boyfriend (?M) or drink herself to death and I (27F) don't know what to do to help her.,9.0,f9nj7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f9nj7l/my_friend_33f_is_going_to_get_murdered_by_her/,11.0,1582719521.0,"Hello everyone, this is my first time posting so I apologize if I have any mistakes in this post.

My friend (33F), let's call her Dee, lives in Sacramento County, 3 hours away from me (27F). Dee has been dealing with her abusive recent-ex (?M), let's call him Al, for years now. I believe 2-4 years was the length of their relationship--I am unsure because it was on-again-off-again, and she didn't talk about him a lot. When they were together, Al verbally and psychologically abused Dee: he urinated on her to get a rise out of her when she wouldn't react to his anger, and then stabbed the sides of the mattress with a knife while she was laying on it to intimidate her. There were many incidents of him getting drunk and kicking down doors, punching holes in walls, and being verbally abusive. I learned about these incidents after they had already broken up.

Some background on Dee; as a child, Dee was sexually abused by her mother's boyfriends. She grew up in a misogynistic household with her two brothers--one older, one younger. Dee also grew up around alcoholics. She herself is a late stage alcoholic, she gets tremors and has seizures when she stops drinking. She has attributed her alcoholism and depression to childhood trauma. From what I understand, Al also has a drinking problem. She told me that Al has been arrested for two DUIs and aggravated assault. She once stayed awake for three days straight because she was afraid Al would break into their apartment and hurt her during one of their breaks. Also, Al has expressed wanting to die, saying that suicide by police would be a good way to go.

Whenever I talk to Dee on the phone, she is usually intoxicated, even during the morning and early afternoon. When I ask Dee, ""are you drunk right now?"" she answers by telling me that she is stressed out about her ex and is afraid that he will harm her. She is currently living in the apartment that she once shared with the Al, he moved out and Dee's friend moved in. Dee says she doesn't have enough money to change the locks so I went ahead and bought her some chain locks for her doors to add *some* protection, but those are probably easy to kick in.

During our phone conversations, Dee tells me that she's having a hard time, but refuses to seek help. She says it's ""too humiliating"" being a victim of abuse and doesn't want anybody to know. She doesn't have health insurance, doesn't qualify for state aid, and so will not seek therapy. She also has a very stigmatizing view of therapy, saying ""therapy is for p\*ssies,"" ""ew, no, never,"" so I don't think she'd get help even if she could afford it. She has expressed wanting to go to rehab, but again, she doesn't have health insurance nor a court order, so it wouldn't be covered by the state.

Dee claims that she went to the police station to seek a restraining order against Al, but that the police were very dismissive. Apparently they said she didn't have any evidence, which brings me to my next concern. Today, she sent me several voicemails that Al had left her over the past few months, they were vulgar and threatening and he even says, ""this is Al,"" in a few of them. I asked her, ""did you show this to the police?"" A question I have asked her many times. Every time I ask this question, she doesn't give me a straight answer and instead dances around my question. I finally had enough and called her out on it (screenshots). She claims the voicemails would make no difference and a restraining order would probably make her situation worse.

I am starting to have a very hard time because I fear for Dee's life. I worry about her well-being, but at the same time, I am frustrated with her lack of action. For months I have listened to her empty promises to herself to make positive change in her life, but the situation seems to be getting worse. The last time I face-timed with her, she looked hollow, like a skeleton with sagging skin. On social media, she constantly posts tons of inspirational quotes and pictures. She posts pictures of herself with a big, shiny smile, going out drinking with her girlfriends as if she doesn't have severe problems that need attention. It hurts me to look at these posts because I know the truth, she shares all the ugly stuff with me because I am also a survivor of familial abuse and she knows I won't judge her. I too have had suicidal tendencies, and in my gut I think she *wants* to end her pain by ending her life--either by alcohol, or by violence from her ex, \*\*I don't know if this is projection on my part but she has even said as much in text messages and phone calls (refer to screenshots)\*\* I think she doesn't want to live in pain anymore, she seems to be seeking death.

When I speak to my therapist, I am basically told to send Dee positive vibes, but is that really all I can do? I spoke with my lawyer friend who says Dee didn't make an honest attempt to get a restraining order because, in order to do so, she should have gone to family court, not the police station. I've tried to get Dee's brothers involved, but they are totally in denial about the severity of her situation. When Dee stayed up for three days straight, living on alcohol and looking like a zombie, I asked her brother to go check on her, and he was like, ""she seems fine to me!"" She also doesn't seem to have a strong friend group around her, her friends just go out drinking with her and don't check in on her or stay with her. On top of everything, as long as I have known her, she also copes with casual hook-ups that seem to negatively affect her mental state later. Recently, she has been having casual sex with a coke dealer and has been dabbling with the substance.

Dee is such a beautiful soul, an amazing artist, and an extremely intelligent person who never had a chance to spread her wings. The people around her damaged her, they sucked the life out of her, they stole her light, and it enrages me. As someone who deals with the consequences of childhood trauma everyday of my life, I understand how deeply the abuse affects you. However, I also know that healing is *my* responsibility and I try to do what I can everyday to make progress--I acknowledge I have access to some resources she doesn't have, so I can't imagine how hard it must be for her. Regardless, I am not sure Dee is trying to survive and I don't know how to make her care about her life.

My question is: what can I do at this point to help my friend?

TL;DR: My friend is afraid that her ex is going to harm her, but won't take any action against him. She also suffers from late stage alcoholism but doesn't feel like she can heal. She speaks of dying and drinks her money. I am having a hard time because I don't live nearby and I don't know how to help her.

She comes from an extremely wealthy family in China. Her family was extremely kind too. My family isn't super rich, but we haven't wanted for much. The two of them met in another country while my brother was deployed there, and dated for quite a while. Everything was perfect for them. My brother talked about how much he loves her, how amazing she is. She would take our family out to dinner and try to fight to pay the bill. With this the family was basically telling him, ""You need to lock that one down! She seems to be a great person and love you!""

Well they moved from the country they met to America after getting married. Her parents, who were her primary providers in every way, shape and form, essentially cut her off (not because they don't agree with the marriage, but it's just their view that she's now an adult and shouldn't be taken care of anymore by them). So she started having to make ends meet in America after having never worked a day in her life. This is where things have started spiraling. She usually buys designer clothes and bags, jewelry, shoes, etc.. This lifestyle is unsustainable for most people in the world. She has a lot of resentment towards my brother because of his inability to provide these things. She also has a strict belief in ""what's his is mine and what's mine is mine"". She works full time, doesn't pay anything towards rent, groceries, or utilities. 

Things took a turn for the worst around a year ago. She actually blocked my brother from all of her social media, but told him she ""deleted the accounts"". She started acting really sketchy. She would disappear for weeks at a time, not respond to anything, and when he was inquiring about where she was when she got back she'd go crazy and tell him it's none of his business.. She was pretty stupid, and didn't block out everyone from social media who was associated with my brother. My best friend actually saw a picture that she herself posted on instagram of her, legs wrapped around another man, kissing him passionately, in what looked like some nice ""date attire"". My best friend just forwarded the information along. It made it to my brother. He went through her phone and found out that she was having 5 simultaneous full-blown affairs. She was telling each and every guy that she was in a visa marriage, and waiting for her two year check-in with the officer to renew her status for another 8 years, and she was already saying ""I love you"" to each and every one of the guys. This completely blew my mind as one relationship is hard enough to manage. I assumed this was a cut-and-dry divorce, but my brother unfortunately has bipolar disorder, and chronic depression, and it's really hard for him to commit to something like divorce.

So here's where it gets even more complicated. My brother will call me and tell me how she is throwing stuff around the apartment, calling him names, attacking him verbally and physically (where he has marks to show).. at the same time she will be texting my father, mother and I in a group text essentially ""telling"" on my brother. An example would be one time where my brother was on the phone with my father telling him how he had to leave the house because she was attacking him, and he couldn't defend himself without risking hurting her and getting arrested. This was a long drawn-out 45 minute call. While that was going on, she texted us all ""HELP!!!! Ian (not his name, we will call him that though) is slamming doors and yelled at me! I can't take this anymore I don't know what to do!!!!""

So she constantly reaches out to us to complain about him. She's told us things like that he won't have sex with her (which is because she's cheated so much), that he won't clean up the apartment, etc.. 

Anyways, I guess what I'm asking is how can I deal with something like this? It's starting to interfere with my life on a weekly basis. My brother won't do anything about his marriage, his wife won't stop messaging me, and if I block her things blow up even more. I can't block my brother but I've told him multiple times that I'm tired of hearing about his problems with her, if he's never going to fix them. Do I offer him to stay with me for a while to get his life together and transition? I get the idea that maybe he feels like he's stuck in life, and a divorce would prevent him from affording his apartment, etc..

&#x200B;

TLDR: My SIL is horrible, my brother is chronically depressed and bipolar. He won't end things and neither of them will ever stop complaining about each other. I want to figure out how I can remove myself from this situation, or help him out of it?",2020.0,1.0,28.0,08:38:47,victim

When I was 14 I dated this boy was 13, he was good looking. That's all 14 year old me cared about. However he was really abusive, he would tell me he was gonna hit me if I didn't stop doing something and then hit me if I didn't stop. He would stop when I called for mine or his parents. One day he let me have it with punches chain punches while I was curled up in a ball and I just cried and he stopped, started crying and said he was sorry. He stopped being physically abusive for the remainder of the relationship but just started being really mean, he eventually broke up with me before my 15th birthday. 

My parents got me into therapy which was really helpful

I didn't see him again. 2 years ago I ran into him. Long story short we're back together. I know I know, trust me I know. I've heard it all from my family and friends. After he broke up with me he told his parents and they got him professional help. I've personally reached out to his ex's to ask if he was abusive towards them or displayed abusive behavior, they said no. I've reached out to his therapist and he confirmed that he had went regularly for 5 years (and still sees him occasionally) he also got counseling, He has not displayed any abusive behavior. I also know that he was 13 years old, that doesn't excuse his behavior but he's had time to mature and grow from that. I've asked him now why he used to do that and he always says he never had a reason, he just hit me. There never will be a reason for it. Then he tells me he's sorry and reassures me that he'd never do that again. 

Okay so when I first started dating him again it was for different reasons, he's really talented at pretty much everything, accepting, so sweet, tells the funniest jokes and yes he's still very good looking. He just fits me so well, I kept telling myself no that I couldn't fall for him but I did. My family and said the moment he does anything abusive, either I break up with him or I can't he a part of the family. 

2 weeks ago my mom was at my place and my boyfriend was in a bad mood and accidentally knocked the coffee maker off the counter and shattered it. It was an accident but my mom saw it. And since he was in a bad mood when it happened, she saw it as he still can't contain his anger. He cleaned up the glass and ordered a new coffee maker.

My mom the uninvited me from a big family dinner, I asked if I just wasn't allowed to bring him but I wasn't allowed period. She's banned me from all family things, and since my mother is well respected everyone listens to her. My sister won't even let me meet her new daughter unless I dump my boyfriend. I'm not allowed around any of the kids because “I teach them that abuse is okay” and the worst part is most of my family has cut contact with me over this. My own sisters won't return calls, texts, blocked me etc and I just want to cry.

Whatever my mom says goes. If she says Santa killed JFK then so be it, you don't have to believe it but you respect it. And the new rule is no one interacts with me unless I break up with my boyfriend.

Should I tell his long distance girlfriend (F21)?,0.0,errg3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/errg3l/ive_f30_been_having_an_affair_with_my_housemate/,7.0,1579621634.0,"Background, we've known each other for about 6 years, always had chemistry but I was in a long term relationship so it was never explored. He’s been with his GF for about 2 years (long distance almost that entire time, except the first 3 or so months) I have met her, but we don’t have a relationship or friendship.

About a year ago we were living in different states. He experienced some major trauma so moved back to my area where his family is for support. I was experiencing a separation/divorce (so my own trauma).  He needed a place to move in, I had a big empty house and so he and his brother moved in with me.

The affair began just before he officially moved in, in fact the flirting started via text months before he moved back. The affair has been pretty painful and difficult for both of us as he’s convinced that he wants to remain 'committed' to his girlfriend as they have 'future plans' together, but he wants this relationship with me also, only temporarily. 

I’ve been through a lot of ethical and moral turmoil as intentions were unclear for so long eg. He decides to break up with her almost monthly, and makes me aware of this consistently. It put me in a strange position of not knowing what the right decision was for a long time.

I asked him to move out a few months ago as I realised I no longer wanted to continue this, upon which he decided to move across country to her (and away from his entire support network, family and friends).

His brother found out about our affair, and advised all his family and friends, with the plan to tell his GF. Part of his intention was to attempt to keep his brother here, and part was to inform the GF of this so she can make informed decisions on her future. His brother was talked out of it by the rest of his family.

Here’s where my dilemma arises. I have feelings for my housemate (he’s admitted he has them for me also), but given the circumstances, I see no future between us at all and I’ve fully come to terms with that. I never said anything to his GF previously as I guess I considered it kinder? It felt like it was just his and my burden/secret to carry. But now, EVERYONE in all of our lives knows except for the one person who probably should… His GF.

I know I’ve made really unethical decisions and I take full responsibility for my actions that have lead to this point, but now, I just cannot get past the fact that this poor girl is so unaware of everything, and his entire family are going to just cover it all up for the sake of his feelings. It seems so much worse? I feel like everyone deserves to understand the truth of any relationship they are in, and this girl has no idea. And at this point I’m realising that if she does deserve to know the truth, I’m the only person who will tell her. I keep coming back to the idea of ‘treat others like you would like to be treated’ I know I haven’t lived to that moral until now, but I just can’t help but feeling really terrible for her, and thinking if I was in her shoes I would ABSOLUTELY want to know.

Many people in my life know about this, and I’ve received very mixed advice about what to do. I’m also fully prepared for any kind of fallout I might receive, hers, his or his families abuse. If it’s really the right decision to tell her, I will wear all consequences for my actions.

I’m aware I’m going to get comments like “you’re a terrible person” “you made your bed, lie in it” And I understand all of that. But I’m really looking for some sage advice on what the best ethical response is here. I’m not trying to atone for my mistakes in anyway, and my intentions are not selfish (to keep him here to myself). I just really feel like she deserves the truth, my brain just keeps coming back to that point, because that’s what I would want.

Please be kind, mistakes were made, but I’m really trying to figure out the right thing to do now. 

TLDR: Even though I’ve made horrible mistakes, is telling the GF the right thing to do now?",2020.0,1.0,21.0,21:32:14,victim
6,59,Should I contact with my abusive family?,4.0,f3r8wo,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/f3r8wo/should_i_contact_with_my_abusive_family/,12.0,1581710636.0,"I was living in a very unstable household. I grew up seeing my dad beat my mom and got the same physical abuse back. He was an intimidating man who used violence to control both myself and my siblings. My mother was a victim, but she was an emotionally manipulative person. Everytime I did something she didn’t like or if things didn’t go her way she would threaten to hurt herself. I was studying something I didn’t want to in university and my family wanted me to get an arranged married (My family is Muslim and middle eastern).

So on November 2019 I decided I had enough and I packed my stuff and moved to another state to live with my boyfriend. My family didn’t know I had a boyfriend and if they found out my dad would have definitely murdered me or beat me. They don’t know where I’m living and I want to leave it like that for safety reasons. I left everyone behind and I miss me siblings deeply. My boyfriend has been very sympathetic and supportive.

The problem is my family constantly calls and texts me. Since I’ve left Ive gotten over 200 calls and 100 messages (I don’t have the heart to change my number). All the messages I receive are clearly manipulative in nature and I haven’t answered a single call. I want to text my sisters, but I don’t know why I get so scared. I don’t even have the guts to visit them because I’m afraid something will happen. I know they would go and tell my parents if I tried to contact them. I want to so badly, but I don’t want to deal with my parents. I’ve also cut off my aunts and uncles so I have nobody to lean on.

I feel so torn, selfish and guilty that I haven’t talked to my sisters in months.

My father’s side of the family abused the current generation, notably with filming sexual assault and distributing it. I am no longer in contact with my family and am safe, as are the others I am aware of.

I did a lot of work in therapy to work through my trauma, but I think some of it will just stick around. Unfortunately, porn is pretty triggering for me and I can’t really stomach the system that creates it. My boyfriend is of course pretty into it. I recently discovered that he is also into actual nudes girls post and not just actors.

I know it’s a natural impulse to look, but it makes me feel so sick. I feel so hurt by him looking at actual girls and disgusted by some of what he’s into. Our sex life was terrible for a while and I tried to have open communication about it but he never opened up. Finding out that it’s because he was looking at girls I’ll never look like cuts pretty deep and only adds to the feelings of disgust.

I’ve tried talking to him to explain why it hurts but I don’t think I’ve gotten anywhere. I just want to know if anyone has been in a similar position or even if not words of advice.

8,70,I think I am being abused by my family.,6.0,ejzabo,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ejzabo/i_think_i_am_being_abused_by_my_family/,6.0,1578186829.0,"Background: I am 23F. My family consists of a sister 18F and father 50M. I am agoraphobic, with extreme anxiety and depression since I was child due to my mom and being present to see her abused by her ex. She has since passed away. The only childhood friend I still have is on the other coast and has since cut contact with me because his fiancé was uncomfortable when she found out I was lesbian (confirmed by a mutual friend who has known my bff's fiancé for over a decade). Because of my relationship with my mom being fucked, I do not have any maternal family. My paternal family was good up until a few years ago as my step grandma is unhappy with my 'lifestyle'. I do have an aunt and uncle but we are not close. 

Why I'm still at home: When I turned 18 my dad started to date a woman who moved my father, sister and I in with her and her sons after not even a year of dating. I was worried but I wanted my dad to be happy for once as he struggled to raise us. After a few months of living together his gf became abusive emotionally towards my dad and sister and often tried to turn me against them. She ended up stealing a few thousand dollars from my dad before he finally snapped out of it and left. However he was broke at this time. I had just got my inheritance (grandma killed herself, left me a lot of money because I was the only family member to take care of her during cancer recovery) so I paid completely for us to move.

My dad has proved that he is not capable of saving or budgeting. I ended up paying rent ($1.7k) for a year straight while he paid utilities, wifi and groceries. I am only allowed to take a certain amount out of my inheritance each year. After that, my great uncle (someone who I have met twice only and have literally no relationship with) must approve the additional funds I take out. He did not let me take out more that year, leaving my dad to pay rent the last two months. Let it be clear he makes $900 a week and gets New Year and Christmas bonuses. He could have saved a lot as he was paying maybe $400 max a month while I paid the rest. Anyway, the two months he was responsible for was extremely late to the point where we got evicted. 

The new year luckily came around soon after and I paid for us to get a new place, one with more room. With budgeting I was able to figure out how I can pay (again, a lot of it coming out of the inheritance) without absolutely breaking bank. Things were fine for a few months but my sister and dad started to fight. There's always been small ones but these ones are loud, often involve things being thrown or a hole in the wall (that one's on my sister). They need therapy but I am not paying $2.2k each month on rent while my dad maybe puts $200 towards rent and covers groceries, utilities and wifi. We don't have insurance and quite frankly I am not EITHER of their mothers and I don't feel like I should be paying their therapy when they spend about $150 a week on weed. 

I already feel taken advantage of, but given how I am talked to I feel like I may be being abused...

**My sister's treatment towards me**: constantly listing off every single thing that went wrong in her life to the point where if I interject about anything or try to give advice, I get yelled at. My words are often twisted. For example, if I say both her and my dad are in the wrong it quickly comes to 'oh so you think he's right and he should treat me like this?' If she gets upset over a fight it becomes my obligation to get our dad to apologize. She tells ME to go to talk to him. If I don't get him to apologize I'm a bad guy. If I do go talk to him and him and I have a productive conversation, she gets mad and says it is proof of his favoritism towards me— however when she goes to talk to him she spends the majority of the time yelling and listing every. wrong. thing. For example, if she got in a fight over what color the sky is, she would yell that it is green and then would list off that the grass is blue, water is red and blood is white. I hope that makes sense. 

**My dad's treatment towards me**: him and I have a vastly more mature relationship and understanding vs my sister and I, and my dad vs my sister. however, he also treats me like shit some times. I think it is because my sister overwhelms him but I don't think it is okay for how he treats me. It's often ""I'm the father, you're the daughter, you have no say in the matter"" if things get especially heated. For example, he will raise his voice at me. I will tell him not to talk to me like that, as I am not a child. He continues to raise his voice and I remind him that I pay rent here and I am an adult and he is not going to treat me like shit when I have done so much to try to help everyone out. It's infuriating. It's like he treats me like I'm some child who mooches off him despite the fact that I still work from home and what funds I lack in, I use my inheritance to cover for in rent. 

I could go on but I'm just tired. I feel like I'm being used. I feel like I'm being spoken over. My only boundaries are: don't raise your voice or yell at me, and don't threaten or talk about how you want to hurt yourself.... but apparently that's all too much. 

I don't know what to do or where to turn to. Technically if I wanted I could afford to run away and live in a little cottage up in Big Bear or some shit. It's something I've thought about, but I can't. I have no other family. I don't want my dad or sister to kill themselves, fall to drug or alcohol addictions, etc. I want us all to be happy and healthy. I just want stability and a normal family. It's all I've ever wanted and I just can't get that. Even when I have offered to pay for therapy, my dad has mentioned that he doesn't think it will work. I told him he's wrong and to just get me my sister info (San, birth certificate, etc) so I can go about setting it up, but he is unmotivated and thinks my sister will just fight the therapist if they disagree or call my sister out on shitty behavior. And the sad thing is? He's right, because shit like that has happened before when we tried to help her. 

I'm at a loss. Sorry for not TLDR. I don't know how to shorten this.",2020.0,1.0,5.0,06:58:49,victim
9,71,My [20/M] abusive mother wants me to attend family therapy with her. Should I or shouldn't I?,2.0,emkk6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/emkk6g/my_20m_abusive_mother_wants_me_to_attend_family/,6.0,1578652863.0,"Approximately two months ago I finally moved out of my mother's house due to her abusive way of treating me. I tried many, many different times to get her to change or get her to seek help because she had problems that she was taking out on me. I was constantly rebuffed and told things like she couldn't afford it, she didn't need it, I needed to toughen up, etc. When I first moved out my mother tried to make me stay, going from threatening to call the police on me because I took some books that were 'hers', to telling me she'd lost her house without my rent. She's tried several times since then to convince me to reconnect with her and come back. Most recently, she's trying to convince me to attend family therapy with her.

It feels like a smack in the face if I'm honest, because she told me earlier this year that she would set up family therapy due to our relationship going downhill exponentially. It never happened. I went and got my own therapy sessions set up after her abuse became life-threatening in November. Now that she's actually done long-term physical harm, now that she's basically ignored my suicidal thoughts, now that she's finally suffering the consequences of her actions, now she wants me to cooperate with her.

But, this is also the woman who raised me. I still wear the shitty poorly sized ring she got me when I was twelve. She upended her whole life to make sure I was able to go to a school that I could actually function in. She has actually sacrificed a lot for me. But I don't know what has more weight.

So after all my rambling thoughts, I just need some disconnected advice on what to do. It's been killing me the last couple days, especially because now she's trying to get my dad and other people to convince me to go with her.

I'm afraid said family member will find this post. They are a younger siblings of mine, also in their early 20s. I don't want to go into specific scenarios because I'm afraid they will come across this post as I've learned recently that they use reddit. 

A TLDR of it is that they never respect my boundaries, always yelling, belittling me, threatening suicide, taking advantage of me money wise. It's all emotional/mental abuse. I've talked to friends about it. I've researched the warning signs. I have come to terms that I am being abused by this family member. 

However they are younger and are one of my few family members left. It's literally them and one parent. I don't want to kick them out. I just want the fighting and the abuse to stop :( I love them with my entire heart but I can't take it. They're abusing both my parent and I. Said parent and I pay the bills each month. This family member who is abusing us doesn't have a job. They are getting an inheritance in 6 months and will supposedly help us then, but who knows. 

They have nowhere else to go. I really think they have something wrong with them mentally. Our deceased parent had bipolar disorder and I think this family member does as well. We will say something and they will interpret it different/mix words around and get extremely mad. I just don't know what else to do. I try to set up my own boundaries: that I will talk to them but they must do it without threatening self harm, saying they want to die, or yelling, but they can't respect that.

I'm (21FtM) (female to male trans if you didn't understand) unsure how to explain a lifetime in a post but here we go. I was born to an upper middle class family in the Middle East (Jordan). I was raised primarily by my mom (49F) and my dad (61?M not sure at all) was absent for most of my life apart from vacations and when he came back to live with us because of my younger sisters (when I was 14). My mom was very strict with me. I wasn't allowed to dress myself, or brush my own hair, I wasn't allowed to feel upset, I wasn't allowed to be outside without her permission, and even when I hung out with friends, she would be walking behind us with a meter distance between us just to keep an eye on me.   
 

So nevertheless, this weirded people out and I had no friends growing up. So, I made all my friends online, including my now-husband. Anyway, her rules go on and on. I was meant to be the golden child of the family where my mom spoiled me with vacations I didn't ask for and clothes she picked out on me that I hated. As my husband would put it, she gave me an empty silver spoon. She barely took care of me, causing my physical and mental health to go out of wack completely. If I misbehaved, in any way shape or form (raised my voice for a second, said no to something), I got hit. Simple.  
 

I was shipped off to college at 15-16 (I graduated very early because my mom made me skip grades in school) and I lived on my own. My health hit rock bottom in college. I got sick every two weeks, my mental health was awful, I used to cry from anxiety just from talking to people. This dragged my grades to failing. Thankfully the college I was at, were very understanding of the situation. As one of my mentors said, who the fuck ships a barely functioning disabled teenager off to med school. I kept trying to fix my grades for the next 3 years, but with no avail to it improving because my health had gotten even worse and the exam I was trying my damnest to pass had a extremely high fail rate (most people pass on their third try, they eventually scrapped the test for newer students but I had to keep going on the old circuculm which is dumb.)  
 

My family was in denial about my health my entire life, so they just viewed me as a failure. What finally broke me was when my mom and dad told me it was MY fault they are in debt and about to go to jail (which turned out to be a complete lie I eventually caught them in) and that I was a failure. I was scared to go home to them because I knew if I went home, my health would just keep getting worse and worse and they would turn a blind eye to it and continue pressing me to do what they want me to do, like get married to someone I don't like, or force me to study under their eye constantly. So at 19, I ran away because I was sick of feeling like a burden. I ran away to my now husband's family in the US.  
 

The following year was an absolute shitshow. My family showed up on Thanksgiving unprompted, guilt trip me because I was ruining this family, I came out as trans, I got married. Then near the end of 2019, my immigration case fell through and we had to move to Australia (I have Australian citizenship through my mom). My family also had to move to Australia because they lost their jobs in the Middle East (Dubai) and wanted better education for my sisters. They said it would be best if we stayed with them while we figured stuff out since my husband would only be visiting for the time being until we figured out a visa for him. It was either that or just suffer. I can't go back to the US and stay with my husband due to the USA's immigration laws. It fucking SUCKS.  
 

We moved about a month ago, and things were fine until something completely unrelated happened. My parents said they wanted to have a chat with us about it. What it instead turned into was berating me and blaming me for all the short comings of the family. They blamed me for them losing their jobs when I wasn't even there in the slightest. They blamed me for being unable to talk to the rest of our family because I disgraced the family. They blamed me for everything that had happened. They called me abusive and manipulative. They said they could never go back to Jordan or to Canada to my extended family because if word got out about what I did, their reputation would be shit. My husband was about to stand up for me but I broke down in tears and absolutely lost it. I was a ball on the floor crying because I felt like shit. My parents have treated me like shit and have never taken care of me. I felt guilty because I was still clothed and fed, and I wasn't grateful.  
 

When my husband went to comfort me, my mom laughed and said ""here's a tip. she's acting. she's faking it. don't fall for it."" and told him that marrying me was a mistake and he will soon realize it. I then snapped and told them off for having such a double standard with my sisters and I. They took care of my sisters and are never as strict as they were with me. They went and took care of their health and never hit them. And I called them out on it for treating me different. I called out my mom for dismissing the time I told her I was suicidal when I was 14, because I've struggled with it since I was 8. She dismissed it and said she never did such a thing and even if she did, that I wasn't suicidal and just attention seeking. I had enough and went to my room to cry it out the rest of the night. My husband went to talk to my sisters and my sisters told him that mom said I pulled a knife out on the family once. Which, is a lie because WTF. My sisters (15 and 13) have been continously fed lies about me from my mom, causing them to resent? me.   
 

The next day, they pretended like nothing happened. Which weirded my husband and I out. But its been a few weeks and I still feel this guilt in me. Did I really ruin my family's reputation by marrying my husband and running away? Did I really make them lose their jobs? I've been so caught up in this cycle and I have no idea what to do or think. Everyone says its obviously abuse but I've REALLY been caught up in this cycle that all I feel like is guilt that I need to vomit out.   
 

Yesterday, I was registering for classes and I wanted to put my name down as, lets say, Nathan. Because that's the name I chose for myself (its not but it works in this example.) My mom scoffed and threatened me an ""or else"" if I didn't change my name back to either my deadname or as Nat or Natalie. She tried to disguise her transphobia as ""concern"" that I might run into a transphobic professor to which I said no worries I read the handbook front to back and will handle that if that does ever come up. She then went on a rant about how even if I was dead and my body was indistinguishable, she'll never see me as a boy so I might as well fucking give up. She then started saying I'm seriously fucked up in the brain if I dare think I'm a boy and I should just accept my place in life as their muslim Arab daughter. I then raised my voice and said that I really didn't care what she thought and that this is MY fresh start. She then continue to threaten me with an ""or else"" and kept raising her hand at me as if she was going to hit me, so I changed my name back.   
 

My mom refuses to acknowledge I'm disabled (autistic and for the moment wheelchair bound) and refuses to let my husband and I go fix my wheelchair since it had a massive leakage. I'm now homebound and can't really go anywhere without the car or someone to help me walk, and my husband usually helps me walk around. She also refused to register me as disabled for college since she didn't want people thinking I'm ""ret\*rded"" or something. I can't move out because my/our only finanical support at the moment is my family until my husband has his visa approved and he can get a job. But even with visa stuff, they refuse to help until he complies with their conditions (convert to islam, convince me I'm a girl, make me admit I'm abusive toward my parents). So I'm literally stuck here.  
 

If you want more info, ask. Ill be more than willing to provide.  
 

TL;DR: I ran away from my Arab family at 19 and married an American man. My family lost their jobs for unrelated reasons and moved and blamed everything that happened to the family on me and claimed I was abusive. I feel guilt. My mom then hurled a ton of transphobia at me and refuses to let me be myself in any circumstance. My mom is refusing me to let me repair my wheelchair so I can go around without constant help. What do I do without putting my sisters or husband in danger?  Am I the one to blame for their issues? Thank you!",2020.0,2.0,10.0,14:47:40,victim

My daughter (10mo) and I (25) had to move into a place with my mother and youngest sister (16) due to me leaving an abusive relationship.  I need to pay things off and save money, but should be able to move into our own place around October.  I still pay rent with my mom because I am on the lease, but only about $600/month plus internet and cable and a storage unit which they have completely taken over with their things.  My sister doesn’t have a job so I asked her to watch my baby 3 days a week while I go to work and she is really great with her.  However, whenever my sister gets in a pissy mood which is literally all the time, she throws a fit about watching the baby.  I even pay her to watch her.

My biggest issue I have noticed since moving in is that they BOTH treat me like a child.  I mean when I leave the house, they both are questioning where I go, when I’ll be back, ect. *I dont go out partying. This happens even when i take my daughter to the store or just to get us out of the house*
 I’m 25 years old and don’t think this is fair.  My mom blows up my phone a lot and my sister walks all over me with her attitude, but I worry about standing up to them because they are helping me.  I have told my sister if she is going to have such an attitude with me, then I can find someone else to watch the baby- but that just sets my mom off onto this tangent about how having my sister watch her is the best option.  But, when my sister is talking down to me or being a brat, I don’t need my daughter around that.  I just can’t handle being treated like a kid.  My sister even tried lecturing me about staying the night at a friend’s house whom has a daughter too and saying it is not good for my baby to stay in strange houses?  It was one night and I don’t appreciate being talked down to.  I can’t afford daycare at an actual place and my daughter’s dad can’t watch her either.

I just feel stuck and useless.  I feel like they have the upper hand on me and are walking on me since they know I need their support right now.  What should I do?  How can I get them to treat me like the adult I am?",2020.0,1.0,9.0,05:33:13,victim

But I can’t. I loved these people. I had a crush on one of them. The Friday that he broke off the friendship was the day that I was going to tell him my feelings for him. I want to be friends with them again despite everyone telling me not to.

From 14-17 I was groomed by several men. All of this occurred online, mainly via Skype. I was in a vulnerable state suffering with mental illness and some childhood trauma, plus a small-town mentality.

I was very hesitant to interact with them at first but as groomers do, they convinced me to do what they said through ‘friendship’ and ‘romantic’ ideas that made me think they truly liked me.

I have no idea how old these men are as they lied about their ages when I first met them. Claiming to be 18. I know they were all 20+ at the time. I need advice concerning three people. M, D, and V. I am from the UK, as well as D. M is German and V is Serbian.

All three men are married now and were cheating at the time too. M and D have infant children. V is married to a Serbian model and travels the world. Surreal, but she is beautiful and I have no idea what he was talking to me for. This could ruin her career if he is outed as a groomer. Though I think she knows what he has done... >!He has forced me to watch them have sex before but she may not have known I was so young.!<All of them have beautiful and ambitious wives. I only know about their partners due to finding them on other social media that they tried to keep secret from me. I feel an immense amount of guilt. As a teenager I thought I was capable and knew what I was doing. I loved the attention from older guys who I believed liked me. It made me feel mature and their attention took me away from my horrible situation. Looking back, I can see how they manipulated me.

Cutting off contact was not an option for me, they would ring me incessantly until I picked up the call. Then I was afraid of being exposed to my family or friends if I blocked them. That's something I have done since, but only when things fizzled out after time. I have the same fears about pressing charges.

I have met D in person when I was 17. I have undeniable evidence that I could present to his wife. I just don't know how to do this. I know I need to expose them all as they are serial cheaters and groomers and their wives deserve to know for many reasons, STDs, the welfare of their children, legal issues, etc. I'm terrified that other young girls are still being groomed by these men because I know for sure that others were at the time as they would brag to me about this. They all knew my age and continued to tell me how 'mature' I was. It disgusts me now.

I don't know how to best contact their wives. I only know of them through Facebook and Instagram. Would they believe me? They will probably hate me and maybe not listen. I don't know how to present the information. What if they partners manipulate the situation against me? What if they expose me online? I know I need to do this but how, I'm not sure. I am just looking for any advice or information anyone could give me in case someone else has been in this situation?

I fear for the children's futures. I feel guilted into keeping my mouth shut by anyone I've told about this. I feel like a homewrecker. I know if a friend told me about this, I'd say it's not their fault and they were groomed. This is more difficult for me to say about myself.

TLDR: I was groomed from 14-17 by several 20+ year old men who were cheating on long term partners. All serial groomers. How do I tell their wives about this?",2020.0,1.0,14.0,06:22:18,victim
15,90,How do I deal with my dad’s emotionally abusive family?,1.0,exnvts,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/exnvts/how_do_i_deal_with_my_dads_emotionally_abusive/,1.0,1580676081.0,"First and foremost, my dad and his father are wonderful people and I love them both. However, I have issues with the rest of them. 

The thing about that side of the family is that each individual family talks shit about each other, despite being exactly the same (except mine, thanks to my mom’s side of the family; bless them). 

On to the family:

The last time I saw uncle and his family was at my Nana’s funeral (well, more like a celebration of her life; we didn’t want it to be sad and she probably would not have wanted that). I honestly hadn’t seen them in a year or so and they live just shy of ten miles away. My uncle doesn’t bother to spend time with my father. Ever. It’s always very awkward to see them because we never see them. Not that this bothers me, but they didn’t show up to my graduation. I showed up to theirs. They’ve always done their own thing and that bothers me less but it kills me that my uncle won’t spend time with my father. My dad doesn’t have very many friends, and he doesn’t even have his mom or siblings. The ones that should be his friends. I’ve seen him cry because of the shit they put him through and that absolutely kills me. However, they don’t bother me as much as the rest of them. 

Here’s where it gets interesting. 

I’ve always been very close with my aunt (dad’s half sister) and uncle. We always went to their house for a week or so during the summer, up until nearly three years ago, for reasons I will explain. They are among the worst people I have ever met. When I was a kid, I didn’t pay attention to their behavior but when I took my senior trip with them, things really started catching my attention. On the trip, I heard my uncle make some racist comments towards individuals working in an orchard on the Fruit Loop in Oregon. That’s simply the tip of the iceberg. 

Here’s the list of what happened when I was living with them for three months:

- apparently, my uncle used to be physically abusive to my aunt. He isn’t now, but she’s become emotionally abusive towards him. For example, screaming at him and calling him a dumb*** when he misplaced his phone. 

- they told me, straight up, that I wasn’t allowed to be home during the day. I had to drive around and find things to do, and I was barely earning $200 a month. Had to pay for school, gas, and food. 

- the thing with the food: they rarely kept food at home. They were extremely cheap and would only buy things they needed if they had coupons. Even shit they didn’t need. 

- they were extremely cheap. They made me take military showers (get in, get wet, turn off shower, apply soap, rinse off quickly, and get out). I swear on all things holy, she stood outside of the bathroom at one point and told me that I took too long. I was rushing and was barely in there for two minutes. 

- they constantly made racist comments. My aunt called another driver of Latin descent a racial slur because she thought he wasn’t driving correctly. 

- they said all criminals “should be executed” (which I find disgusting). Even if they commit a petty crime. 

- my aunt went on and on for thirty minutes about how my mental illness is a phase; that I’ll grow out of it; that essential oils will fix it; that I should act happy. I’d never been more offended in my life. 

- they went on a trip without me, so they put up security cameras in the house. They told me that they wanted to keep an eye on the house, but I didn’t believe them. If they don’t trust me to be in their house during the day, they won’t trust me while they’re gone. 

- my uncle called me a disappointment to my family because I own a dildo. 

- uncle backed over their Aussie Shepherd with a horse trailer

- aunt backed over my 17 year old lab with a truck

- they kept that dog alive for years. He was blind, deaf, couldn’t walk, and was covered in tumors. That dog was suffering and she kept feeding him pills. It broke my heart seeing him like that. 

- when I got a job at Spencer’s, I stayed out until 11pm. I parked in my college’s parking lot because I didn’t want to be there when they were awake. 

- I had so many panic attacks because I was stuck in that house for the entire semester. I remember calling my parents and crying constantly because of how emotionally abusive they were. They’d always make comments about mental health or about my weight, which really hurt my feelings. I never thought in million years that they’d do that to me but they’ve broken what trust we had. 

- one of their friends chewed me out over the phone and essentially called them saints or some shit like that. 

I left that house in a massive hurry on the last day of school. My professor let me turn in my essay early. Returned my textbooks, packed everything in an hour, and got the hell out of dodge. I cried for the first hour of the drive from Texas to Oklahoma. My dad wrote them a letter essentially saying he’d mail them the gate opener and to never contact us. I haven’t spoken to them in three-ish years. 

My grandmother is a whole other story:

My grandmother has always treated my dad like garbage. Always putting him down. Never coming to visit. Always claiming that he owes her money or that we have something of hers (she literally got mad at him because I had a crocheting book of hers and said he owed her $200 for hay). 

She has always picked favorites, too. I’m the first grandchild so I’ve always been treated like the favorite. Always giving me presents and birthday money. Always remembering my birthday. My sister, however, is completely ignored. My grandmother never remembers her birthday or my cousins’ birthdays. I’m appreciate of what she’s done for me but it breaks my heart to see my sister cry about them missing her birthday because I know deep down that my grandmother doesn’t give a damn about her. She treats my sister like she treats my dad, minus the bullshit “you owe me this, this, and this” moments. My grandmother is in her mid seventies and she’s still babysitting. Newborns to age 7-ish. My grandpa is probably tired of it by now (probably has been for years) but she just won’t quit, and to tell you the truth, she loves those kids more than her own kids and grandkids. She constantly dotes on them and spends time and money on them but can’t be bothered to visit us for an hour, even though we live about five miles away. Any time my sister had a dance recital, she would show up to the recital, but she’d be there for some rando she babysits and not for her own flesh and blood. My sister has been emotionally crushed so many times by that woman. For fuck’s sake. She will fly from Oklahoma to the fucking Ark Encounter museum to walk through that whole thing despite having fucked up knees but she wouldn’t even come to my graduation because she had to babysit. She talked about how much she loves the music teacher who verbally abused my little sister. 

I haven’t seen my grandma in two or three years. Last I heard, she was taken to the ER for a stroke and chewed out the poor staff members over little things. 

I’m posting this because I want to know how to respond to them if I ever see them again (likely at a funeral). 
- If my grandmother tries to make conversation with me, I’ll go along with it but I’m terrified of seeing my aunt and uncle again (the Texas ones). 

I’d also like to know how to put up with the shit they put my family through because I wanna be supportive (I hate seeing my dad and sister get so miserable from how they’ve been treated). 

Should I just cut them out? If not, how do I deal with them?

Also, do you guys have any advice with getting over something like this? I’d like to move on but something always comes up. 

Thanks, everyone.",2020.0,2.0,3.0,02:26:21,victim

We've been long distance for over half of our relationship and that in itself is hard to deal with at times. We've been trying to close the gap, but he is only comfortable joining me in my grad school housing if he had the job he wanted (it's in a niche field and the college town is isolated). My future is not very solidified either and that adds some anxiety on top of things. 

Recently, his family (with whom he's still living) are being borderline emotionally abusive towards him (e.g. gaslighting, saying things that sworn enemies never say to each other, undermining his confidence). I want to get him out of that environment, but I can't make him and he's experiencing pretty bad depression from his parents telling him that he should have not been born. This is making him feel trapped, but I only hear about a gung-ho plan to move in and live with me when they're fighting. This puts me in a weird position and I don't feel too comfortable building a life together like that.

I've been almost tempted to break things off with him  in the past few months as I feel like I'm slowly falling out of love. I'm now getting anxious about if he DOES move in after all this since I don't want to be stuck in an unhappy relationship and he'd be somewhat financially and personally dependent on me since the rest of his family are being twats and there is a lot of country between us. Also, now that their house is so hostile, I worry about breaking up with him since I don't trust his parents to be supportive. I feel like I'd crush him and I have such a hard time with that and I've had suicidal ex's before and don't want to repeat that.

I feel like I'm his whole world and all that he feels is good in his life, but my life is deteriorating because of this relationship. If you all could give me some advice, I'd really appreciate it! If you need to know anything else about our situation, please let me know. Thanks for reading!

To put the change in perspective, during high school I had a great deal of friends, participated in multiple organizations, and was the captain of a varsity sports team. 

I attend a university roughly 15 minutes from home, and originally had a dormitory on campus. Move in day happened, but from that day my mom would not let go. She would constantly text. My father would walk around outside the dorm complex. My level of privacy was near zero. I couldn’t go anywhere without them spying on me thanks to Find my iPhone. After about a month of this I gave in and left the dorm to live back at home. 

Academically, my father seems to have a set path for me. I have limited role in choosing my courses even though I explain time and time again about expanding my knowledge in diverse fields. I have spoken to my mother about this, but she doesn’t make any effort to convince him to change his ways. I explain I need to take the courses that will lead me to a good job/graduate program in my field. But to no avail. 

Currently, I live at home and commute to school. Because roughly 95 percent of the students live on campus I have found it nearly impossible to find friends. When I mention to them the possibility of social plans they make excuses for me not to go. And, at this point my only social life consists of seeing extended family members on the weekends and attending class  for a couple hours each day. The last time I spoke to a non family member outside of class without my parents nearby or expecting me at a certain time was August.

I do maintain friendships from high school, but as you all know, those friends get busy and can’t be there to chat all the time. I am asking for any advice on what to do in this situation. Leaving the house likely isn’t a real possibility, and I don’t want to lose my relationship with my parents. 

It is time for me to gain freedom. I am trustworthy. I don’t drink. I don’t smoke. I maintain a 4.0 GPA at what I would deem a prestigious university. Thank you all for reading.

Around Thanksgiving she called me at 2am crying and saying her bf had attacked her and would not let her leave his house. I was barely awake so I was pretty stunned. She said not to call the cops or tell my dad and she had her bff, (20something f), picking her up and staying at her place. 
When I checked up on her the next day she was much better and was telling me how they were breaking up and she was moving back in with our dad. 
My sister and I come from a somewhat abusive family and we are all basically emotionally repressed so we lack communication between each other. 
Jump to Thanksgiving day everyone is coming to my little apartment for dinner and no one has had contact with my sister. We call and there's no answer so my dad along with the cops go to her bfs house. Nothing bad happened she was just moving her stuff out of his place. She seems very cool, calm, and collected so we don't make a fuss.

Before Christmas I notice we haven't made any plans like we usually do. We have a lot of Christmas traditions that we just do together, watch movies, make cookies, and shopping. Somehow middle of the night I miss a call from her. So I texted her right away after noticing. She went back to her bf and he choked her and wasn't letting her leave. I was on my way to work and decided to call out and pick her up and have her stay with me but she decided to be with a friend instead again. Also cops got involved this time but she says the cops didn't believe her. I tried talking her out of her relationship but she insists he loves her and says he will kill himself if she leaves him. Idk what to do or how to handle this so I started to distance myself from her. I thought there's no way I can force her to leave. Which makes me an idiot because it got so much worse. Saw her Christmas morning she was in a good mood and we were enjoying breakfast together. Didn't hear about her bf and didn't want to bring up her bf so she would stay in a decent mood.

My dad called me new year's day saying my sister was dropped off at his place by a friend and he was taking her to the hospital. He said she was talking strangely and was acting like a drug addict. My sister told us she was in a sex cult and being raped by him and the neighbors and her bf was forcing her to take meth and cocaine. We all freaked the fuck out and were with her at the hospital the last few days. My dad and his wife were great and said they would take care of everything and have her move back in and keep her safe from the abusive bf. 

Yesterday morning my sister was released from the hospital and I came to visit her at my dad's. The situation had changed completely. Apparently there was no sex cult and she wasn't forced to take drugs, she took them willingly with her bf and hallucinated a million different crazy things. To be honest I am relieved she wasn't being raped and all the things she described to me at the time were most likely not true. 

So my dad and his wife's attitudes had completely changed when they learned this and now have no interest in helping beyond letting her stay in her room, at least for now. My dad told me he won't have her going back to her job (because her bf works there), he took her car and placed it at his work parking lot, he gave her phone back but first went through all her texts and Instagram. They told me if she doesn't follow their rules she will be cut off (not sure from what they never helped with anything before this). They just sit in their living room watching TV and playing on phones and tell my sister to clean and do something besides be a downer even though it's only been hours after being home from the hospital. They also went back to planning a bday party for my dad's wife which isn't even happening until March. Acting like nothing happened except to hold this terrible situation over my sister's head until she runs back to her bf. 

I'm at a loss as how to handle my sister and my dad. They are incredibly stubborn people and refuse to talk it out. There is also some information missing from all this but I just wanted to give the main details. 

I want to convince my sister to try therapy/counseling but not sure how to approach it. And I feel I should cut off contact with my dad and his wife for how they are acting but I don't want to make things worse for my sister too.",2020.0,1.0,6.0,02:41:05,victim

My (now) ex-gf asked for a break to solve her psicologial problems caused by years of family abuse. Her mother left her when she was a baby and she was raised by her grandparents who actually trated her very badly through the years. Besides everything, she turned out as a great person, caring, lovely and well educated. She got her degree, worked her entire life and always was great to me.

We lived together for 3 years and had a great relationship, until she got fired. The company she worked at broke completely and had to fire all thier employees. Since then I had to take care of our financial life and it caused us many problems once we couldn't adapt very well. Because of, that her psicologial health got bad.. All the problems she had in life started coming back to her mind and she started acting cold and distant. She was at home the most part of time and our messy life caused us many fights, but yet, we always fixed that and tried to stay well as much as we could.

A few months ago, I caught her talking to someone else... and we broke up. She told me she was feeling bad and the guy ""took advantage"" of her weak moment and sort of filled her mind with kind words(nothing sexual or really emotional) while I was at work. It was a horrible moment because she never did that before, she never even gave me reason to doubt her fidelity all those years! She deleted the guy and said that she would never do that again to anyone else.   
After that episode she got even worse... she felt more guilty than ever because she made me bad... and I was the only person she got help from in the past in her hard times... and quoting her own words she ""loves me"". She got really depressed and had many episodes of panic attacks. She left all social media, didn't use her phone, didn't talk to anyone, even her friends.

Later we tried to fix it and make it works again, but she was already felling really bad! Then she decided(finally) that she needed help and thought it was better for ourselves to break up before we got hurt by each other. 

Since then we talk everyday... she's way better, but there's still a long way to go... the problem is that I'm feeling really distant and insecure with all that. I feel like she could meet someone in that time and I'd get really hurt because Ilike her a lot. We had a beautiful relationship...she was always there for me and we built so many things together. She says that she doesn't feel well to start a relationship yet (with anyone), but what if she does? what if she finds someone else in meantime and I'm here just waiting for something that might never come back as before?

I need some advice, guys.. sometimes I get really cold, distant and decide to move on, then I talk to her as I always talked again..I don't really know what to do or what to think. I'm not used to that type of ""break up"" and I have no clue what should be the most rational thing to do now.

First I'll introduce myself and my family as it's relevant (involving only my aunts and uncles on my mother's side, all biological ). I'm not sure on ages and I'll also be using fake names.

*Harriet (\~80s F) Maternal Grandmother, Alfred (70M deceased since 2008, miss you Grampy) Maternal Grandfather*

*Cathy (late 50s? F) Maternal aunt, Bryce (late 50s? M) Maternal uncle and godfather, Martha (early to mid 50s F) mother, Nancy (early 50s F) Maternal aunt, Kevin (early 50s M) Maternal Uncle. Lisa (50s F) maternal cousin but the grandkids call her ""Aunt Lisa"".*

*Tidal (25 almost 26 F, gay) me, Terry (62? M) dad, Shaun (18 almost 19 M) Brother.*

Me and my mother were never really close. When I was young, she'd try to instigate me to do things that she told me would be funny or she knew would agitate my dad. It worked, but I trusted her somewhat because I was a young kid (around 3-5). Dad however was the one to taught me things like morals, helps to encourage my love for reading, creativity and trying to teach me things so I'd understand the basics of how or why something worked. We had moved from the town we live in currently, out to the country -same province-, then to Calgary Alberta then back to the town we live in now. (We live in Canada)

Around the time I started school, I started picking up on the tension in my family. I didn't understand why at the time there was so much fighting between my mother and my dad but I remember one event when I was about 5 or 6 Where my mother was hysterical and had locked herself in the bathroom and she was going nuts. My dad ended up calling Cathy to calm her down and talk her out of the bathroom, while he took me out somewhere so I could calm down and relax.

Around that time I had been asking for a brother. I remember that we had been planning on moving and getting our own place, so we moved a few streets away from where we had lived in the town. My immediate family -both Maternal and paternal sides- lived scattered around the town, so if anything happened, I'd be able to stay with family (As my dad's rather estranged with his family). I remember tensions rising during my mother's pregnancy and noticing them more. At the time my dad was working at a plant where they made car parts and my mother was starting to lash out at me. When dad was home, she'd dial it back, but when he was gone, she could do what she wanted.

Towards the end of her pregnancy, she started getting more and more volatile towards me and my dad. I remember one incident where my mother got up in his face and started hitting him. My dad grabbed her arms and tried to lead her away gently as he didn't want to her her. he let go of her once he lead her away and returned to the room but she followed him, screaming and shouting at her. He tried to leave but she was face to face with him , so he gently took her by the shoulders and guided her out of his way. My dad always did this whenever she got in his face. There was an allegation that arouse AFTER this event, but I'll explain this later.

My mother gave birth to my brother a week early, because the Placenta had started to separate from the uterine wall. (I remember my mother talking to Harriet about it in the hospital after my brother was born). Otherwise my brother was healthy and our family doctor commented about missing both me and my brother.

**Now remember the Allegation and the fact that my brother's birth was caused by the Placenta situation.**

By second grade, it was apparent that I had ADHD and was having a slight problem in school. Math was always a difficult subject for me, and my mother being very good at advanced math and science was frustrated that I was struggling. One of the most vivid instances of her abuse was when I was in second grade, when i was struggling with my math homework. Every time I'd struggle with a math problem or get it wrong, she'd erase all my work and the answer for the previous question and make me re-complete that problem before moving on.

As the situation worsened, she started erasing more and more of the work I had completed until I was redoing EVERY question again every time I got an answer wrong. This was resulting in her screaming in my face ad my being terrified and crying. It led to her grabbing me by the back of the head -by my hair- and slamming my face into the math book and the table -the bottom of the math book came to roughly the bridge of my nose while the rest of my face was meeting the table - repeatedly until she stopped.

After that, Physical and verbal abuse quickly became the norm over the next several years. It lead to me withdrawing into myself, trying to run from her, repeated beatings, her tearing hair out of my head, threats, me flinching or obeying under threat of beatings, missing opportunities or chances to socialize, being denied food, sent to bed in only my underwear (during winter) etc.

It was bad enough that I was heavily bullied in the neighborhood and at school, but i now had to contended with my mother. Sometime in around 3rd grade, I was put on Ritalin for my ADHD. I didn't want to go on it and my dad didn't want me on it either, but my mother pushed it after my doctor suggested it and I was on it until I was switched to Concerta in Jr. High.

I did try to reach out twice about her abuse. The first time was when I was in fifth grade (classmates told the teacher to told the principal who called home.) Where mom lied and told the school that I apparently had been grounded and was blowing things out of proportion (for years dad didn't understand why he had to pick me up at his sister's (Mylynne late 60's F) house and why mom was hysterical). I ended up getting detention for 2 weeks and had to make an apology in front of my class for ""lying"". The second time I snuck the cordless phone up to my room and called the child's help phone so see if I could get help. Not long into the call my mother came up and started yelling at me, before taking the phone, ending the call and unplugging the phones for the night.

After that I stopped trying to reach out and report my mother. She then started taking the opportunity to start driving past the police station with me while screaming at me and making my hysterical, telling me she'd have me locked up for misbehaving -even though I wasn't. This has made me fear the police and I have to build up courage to speak to them without fear.

As things continued, she started moving on on my brother as well. I tried to protect him when i could and as best as I could, but it was clear that she was favoring him over me period. He was the good, smart child while I was ""the test child"", and I was ""stupid, useless, lazy"" etc. Apparently me having ADHD (and later being diagnosed with a Non-verbal learning disability) had something to do with it. Spankings were done with a blue and green plastic spoon, nicknamed ""the blue spoon"". Eventually she moved to a metal one that was heavier and hurt a hell of a lot more. I remember her requesting it and saying she wanted it because it hurt more and ""still had sharp edges"". Not getting her the spoon earned me and my brother more beatings and whoever didn't get the spoon when she asked for it got even more and harsher beatings.

Around my teenage years I was highly awkward -due to lack of outside social skills and socialization- and not in a good spot mentally. At one point I tried to take my own life, between the bullying (one instance when i was 15 involved a gang of girls harassing me only for one to beat the crap out of me every time she left and i got up off the ground, mom said i deserved it and my grandmother said I brought it on myself from what neighbors told her) and the abuse. My mother somehow heard me trying to strangle myself and walked in. Instead of trying to stop me or talk me out of it, she actually started to strangle me. I won't get into how I was doing it, but when she stopped, I remember her saying ""you won't try that again will you?"". To this day I'm not sure if I blacked out or fell asleep because I don't remember anything between her walking out of my room and the next morning. I tried several more times,over the years but luckily, i had good friends now who helped talk me out of it.

**As a side note: If you or someone you know is having suicidal thoughts or considering it, please reach out to someone. Taking your own life will only hurt others and it will make them ask why you did it and it may make them question why they couldn't see it or stop it. It may make their situation or their own mental stability worse. reach out and seek help. Everyone deserves happiness.**

When I was in Jr high and part of High school, Dad would travel out to Alberta in fort Mac to work in the oil sands. She used to cut off the phone calls and wouldn't let us talk to him to let him know what was going on. My mom once sent me to school when I had the flu, and EVERYONE could tell I was sick. The teachers told me to stop complaining if i wouldn't stay home -I was talking and explaining to my classmates who obviously didn't want to get sick- and I told the teachers to tell that to my mother because she was the one forcing me to go when I wanted to stay home.

Eventually on Wednesday I was that sick i wanted to reschedule my Orthodontist appointment to get my braces off, and the vice principal told my mother to keep me home until I had fully recovered and that if i was sent to school before then, they'd send me home immediately. My mother complied because she was close to being caught again. But while i was sick, any dirty dishes that weren't cleaned properly, I had to eat and drink from them. I wasn't allowed to rewash them before eating off them, I had to eat off them as was.

She got pissed that it was taking me so long to recover and that weekend, we had a snowstorm. I was almost over the flu but that day I was dealing with diarrhea as well so every so often, I'd run back in and use the bathroom. My mother got upset with this and when I finished helping her shovel, she locked me outside. I then walked halfway across town to where my Grandmother and Grampy lived. The snow stopped for a while but i was still feeling a bit weak so the 15-20 minute journey was made longer by plowed roads and sidewalks and me stopping to rest on snowbanks. My grandmother had an epic fight on the phone after i arrived and my grandfather was upset, but focused on calming me down and letting my rest, while my aunt Cathy -who was home visiting from Alberta- was beside herself in anger. We had pizza for dinner and around 7 or 8 pm my mom called and wanted me to walk home. My grandmother was PISSED and started screaming about how there was blowing snow and poor visibility and how it was like -18C or something. My Grandmother fought her on it and drove me home. when i got home i was immediately sent to my room and i could hear my mom and grandmother talking downstairs -my room is above the kitchen and part of the back porch- but i couldn't hear what they said.

As the years progressed. things began to break down further between my parents, and my dad was starting to catch my mother's actions towards me and my brother. He knew ad saw the -now faded- scars on my left hand where my mother dug her nails into the back of my hand and clawed me. She began to try to turn me and my brother against my dad as she knew she could use fear to control me. It almost worked until I started hitting 15 and 16.

When I was 14ish, my Grampy Alfred was diagnosed with bowel cancer. My Grampy was one of my favorite people. Like my dad he was encouraging, loving, honest, fair and patient. To him, children were the future and they could be nurtured and taught life lessons. When our family was being harassed by my bullies and our windows were being smashed, my Grampy almost grabbed one of the kids one night after they threw something at our house and it hit (My Grandmother Harriet managed to stop him). He was a wonderful man. My understanding is that when ha passed he had bowel, Lung and another type of cancer. He passed when I was 15, 2 days after I started High School.

It was in around here that I started to piece things together and I met a good friend of mine who we'll call Abby (23 almost 24 F). Abby lives in South East Asia. I met her online and i lied and told my family that I met her at school. I spoke about her a lot but because of my mother's behavior, Me, my brother and dad couldn't invite our friends over often. A year or so after I met Abby, my mother flipped out and asked dad why he let me talk to Abby. Dad told her that i hate met her at school so clearly she was safe to talk to. My mother gave it up after that but not before she started making racist remarks.

Over the years, my mother destroyed my self esteems relationships and belongings -and threatened to destroy more. I grew close to Abby and my mother tried to ruin that as well. Unfortunately for my mother, any attempts to sabotage my computer or accounts on my computers were foiled by me knowing more than her. I once foiled an attempt by her to send racist remarks to Abby via MSN messenger -as I was logged in on my desktop in my room and my laptop in the dining room where I was studying for exams- by logging my desktop off and apologizing to Abby.

When sometime after I reached 16, I clued in to what my mother was doing and what she had done to me was indeed wrong, but I didn't feel strong enough to fight back completely. I tried harder than ever to protect my brother however as she liked to make inappropriate comments about him and apparently privacy is a foreign concept to her if it's me or my brother (she would walk in 99% of the time without knocking). I also tried to call her out on her lies and slander when she was on the phone. She quickly started taking the cordless phones with her so i couldn't hear what she was saying.

She said I had attitude and it got worse as I got older, but I realize now that it was me slowly trying to fight back against her. She tried a few times to abuse me physically in my later teen years but we both learned that I had unfortunately inherited her temper when it cam to certain things and after destroying some of my posters one day -if i spoke she'd destroy one, if I didn't speak she's also destroy one- , I ran at her, going from one end of my room, up over my bed and to the doorway.

Neither of us knew what was going on until our brains caught up with us and we realized that I had my hands around her throat. I let her go and told her to fuck off before I snapped again. Her second attempt had me almost punch her in the head but i stopped myself and i walked away so I could cool down.

She was scared in both cases and I'm ashamed of letting my anger get the best of me especially when pushed. Since then, I've gotten much better at controlling my anger and I instead direct my anger in violent video games -it works idk why- or I find a way to calm down so I can let go of any anger, all so I don't become like her.

After that, she moved to emotional and verbal abuse. She tried to hurt me by taking away my high school prom but i hadn't planned on going anyway and i told her that i wasn't sure if i wanted her at my graduation. She then started saying that I'd never graduate, that I was a failure i won't get a job or accepted to collage, and after I'm 20, starts saying ""the only sex \[I'll\] ever get, will be through a computer"" and asking ""how's the baby doing?"" While petting my belly as i was gaining weight and trying to lose it. That hurt and i ended up having to lie to dad when I was 17 about questioning my sexuality because I realized that I wasn't really interested in guys, but I pretended to due to hostility and joking from my parents.

After graduating high school (mom decided not to attend after I decided to be nice and offered her the ticket so she could come) Getting accepted to and graduating collage (she threw me out of the house around my last 3 exams causing me to fail them due to stress and i almost failed 2 out of three when i did the re-write before i was allowed back in the house). One day she threatened to kill me and kill herself so she wouldn't get caught. After she went upstairs me and my brother hid anything she could use to stab or slash at us with, in the basement. My mother then threatened to beat us and hurt us if we didn't get them. Reluctantly we did, and she disconnected the phones that night.

Before the last rewrite, my mom was driving me and my brother home from where my school was. Mom was upsetting me and my brother while on the highway while ranting and raving. We were crying ad my mom in a fit of anger, jerked the wheel and aimed for a center -concrete beam- or an overpass. We started screaming and mom jerked the wheel back to the outside lane and me and my brother went silent after she shouted more.

**Remember the allegation my mother made against my father, and how my mother's placenta separated from her uterine wall? Well here's where it gets important!**

Not long after we were driving home from coming from the same area the school was in. My mom then turned to my brother and in a bitter tone told my brother that the reason why he was born early -he already knew he was born a week early, but didn't know why- was because dad pushed her. I immediately called her out on her bullshit and told my brother the real reason. My mother gave me a look of ""oh shit she knows the truth?"" and I've since found out that she's been slandering my dad and saying that he pushed her while she was pregnant. She uses the day I described above, except she says that she was pushed back over the ottoman when he returned to the living room.

Like I said, my dad's NEVER done anything of the sort. He's been scratched, punched, had his clothing stretched when she pulled on it, she's spit on him and threatened to lie to the cops about being beaten up. Me and dad are the only one who know the truth. She also denies hauling off and SMACKING -as in almost sending my brother off his feet on the stairs- just to get my dad going, in an attempt to start a fight. when that didn't work, she tried turning me and my dad against each other.

After getting my first job at the school as a fill in secretary, I started saving up money to Travel to Abby's home country and to build my own computer. My mother got upset with how I was spending my money -I had no bills and I paid off my loan thanks to dad planning ahead and having money set aside for my education. A few months later I got a job at McDonald's and after enduring more of mom's abuse (and my brother's sudden and unexplained seizure, I saved up enough money to go see Abby.

By this point it's 2015 and I'm 21 going to be 22 in Spring. Can't afford to move out either way, no car, can't find work as a paralegal/legal assistant and my mother's 's upset with me. I'm not spending my money the way she wants. i should be saving for a car, I should be saving to go back to school, I should be moving out (average rent around here is $1,000 per month, not including food, heating and other utilities), I should be paying her ""more than half my monthly pay"" in rent (dad tells me not to and to save my money) even though i may make on average $400 a month IF I'm lucky, maybe $200 a month in the winter months (Jan to about Mid March sometimes April), instead of saving for the trip.

Dad thinks she's full of crap, I agree and I realize i have the money a year before I expected. I book the trip a year in advance and decided to go in 2016 rather than 2017 (this later turns out to be a good move). Mom gets pissed off further and harasses me about it all year. December finally comes and she brings it up again, saying she should come with me.

*No way in hell.MP4*

Me being a smart ass (and sarcastic) sighs and says that sure, she could come with me and see the sights, but she'd better cough up the 9k. That shuts her up about the trip until the week before I leave. then she complains that I'm leaving and bitching about me leaving the day before her birthday (My flight left Jan 31st 2016. Her birthday was the next day. IDGAF, I wanted to get to South East Asia -on my first plane ride in like 18 tears, and on my first real vacation, solo at that- before the Chinese New Year and before the CNY flights get crazy busy.

Brother has his second seizure in October -again unexplained- and things are getting really tense between my parents. Mom's been working for about a year now, but we're not seeing the money, and we got a weird thing in the mail about mail redirection.

Month later, Nov 10 2016 shit hits the fan.

One girl is getting sick so my drive wants to leave early to drive her home from class -before noon. Get home 2 hrs before I'm expected to and i let myself into the house. A bunch of stuff is in front of the door between the porch and the kitchen. Even the cat -technically my mother's- seems spooked. Mother somehow didn't hear me enter the house and enters the kitchen and sees me in the porch trying to make sense of the mess of clothing and bags in front of the door. Her face clearly says ""oh shit"" so i ask what's going on and she asks me what I think is going on. I say ""you're cleaning the storage room...?"" and she announces that she's leaving.

Her plan was to pack stuff up for a while then move her shit out when we're not home. Then she returns to our house and waits for bro to get home, take him to the bank and tell him she's leaving and telling me and dad last. Me being home early fucks everything up, so I'm thrown for a loop.

Grandmother shows up and while my mother puts her shit in her car. Nan spews shit about ""not wanting \[my mother\] to end up at a woman's shelter"" and ""knowing \[she'll\] take shit for this"" (for letting my mother stay with her). They question me about how I feels and i state I'm not sure yet etc. I tell them that even though they're both older than me -mom being nearly twice my age- I know there's a better way to settle this than sneaking around and moving out when no one's around. I get she wants to leave in as little stress and fighting as possible, and she doesn't want to argue and fight while packing but there's a more mature way to handle things. The fact that I can see this and I'm acting more rational and mature than she is -she's acting like someone my age or younger WTF?-is beyond belief.

Mom tells me that she took what belongings she wanted and that anything my dad got her, she's leaving behind and doesn't want, and that she's washed the sheets before leaving so dad doesn't have to worry about the bed. They tell me not to tell dad and they want me to help throw him under the bus. I'm pressured into hugging her when I don't want to.

I call dad immediately after they leave because I don't like to lie and it's not right to let him suffer like that. I can tell it breaks dad's heart but he's glad I told him. He gets new locks and knobs for the doors. I tell mother to get the cat because yeah I'll miss him, but the cat has separation anxiety from my mother and that being along for approx 12 hrs a day isn't fair or kind to the cat. Her and nan return for the cat and start trying to tear me a new one for ""not giving \[my mother\] the opportunity to tell dad herself."" I lie to them to cover my ass and because as much as i hate it, they deserve it. Mother takes brother to the bank and dad arrives home while she's still gone. Dad's broken but pushes through and mom doesn't want to enter the house but eventually gives in and gets pissed because dad's already working on changing the locks. She reiterates that she got her belongings and she doesn't care what we do with that she left behind. she give the house key back but dad and I don't trust her.

She leave us in a haze that lasts months and we mention that not only do i not want to talk to her for at least a month or two, but that we want to be left alone for Christmas, no visits, no gatherings, no exchange of gifts. Leave us alone. Mother calls after a month and wants to talk. Dad listens in.

Anyway, dad's trying to work things out with her and she's being somewhat civil at first, but then turns nasty. Typical woman in a divorce bullshit, wants half of what the guy owns, won't do X, Y ad Z until he coughs up money etc. She goes from ""I don't want the house or anything"" to ""I was $30 k if you want my name off the house and car."" Tells dad that even though we ALL know we're starting to live paycheck to pay check and he can't afford it, she says he needs a loan. A bank won't give him a loan at his age fuck off, the house isn't even worth that much.

Our wishes aren't respected, she starts calling regularly and recording us -by law you have to notify people you're recording them, she doesn't and i only pick up on it one day because she has an iPhone provided by her job and i have an iPod touch, the recording sound is identical. Things keep going downhill.

Mother's been slandering dad for years, so none of my mother's family is any help to us, they actually turned against dad. Mom tried to play the ""I want an open relationship with my kids/ I want a relationship with Shaun (brother)!""Me and Shaun tell her of several times. she tries to arrange a meeting with me and brother, she gets pissed because dad's there and wants to hear what's being said. We say no. she then tries to talk to me and bro separately in nan's car. We don't feel comfortable at all and I start trembling, but not from the cold. no one notices. Mother speeds back to Nan's and leaves us a nasty voicemail. I snap and call to leave her one back, only she picks up.

Cue World War 3 over a phone line.

I'm not being professional, my Paralegal training is out to lunch and I unleash. I'm trembling again but dad thinks it's from rage -it's not- and he's giving me thumbs up every so often from across the kitchen because i keep hitting the nail on the head and mom's getting pissed. Mother later tried to turn me into the bad guy by lying to dad about me being a brat and cursing and swearing at her over the phone. Dad calls her on her bullshit and lets her know he's heard every conversation and mom storms out of the meeting but not after trying to cause a scene.

Dad starts explaining to me and my bro the drama in my mother's family involving him, how they've never respected him or his wishes, how they are viscous gossips (they are), and how they're 2 faced and hypocritical (again they are), etc. and how my Grampy must have known that my mother was mistreating us or something, because he told dad at some point ""I've seen the way that Martha treats those kids, and sometimes I just want to smack her."" We're not sure how much my Grampy knew, but he clearly wasn't happy with what he did see/knew. He lets us know that he felt pressured into giving my mother kids and knew something like this was probably going to happen, but he was willing to try to work things out. He clarifies that he DOESN'T regret having us and that he loves us dearly, but he had hoped to spare us from the similar things he went through growing up.

It's 2017, Flash forward to May. Brother just turned 17 a week prior. Dad's birthday was the day before. Mine's in a week. We need to get a case for brother's new phone, so bro can get me my gift and so dad can get his haircut. Bro and I sometimes have out get along no problem/ fight like cat and dog moments, but with a 7 year difference we're still really cool and into a lot of the same shit. Dad goes to get his hair cut while me and bro ""troll around the mall"" (our term for chill and hang out in the mall). Start at the food court/ where dad's going to get his hair cut and we head down to the other end of the mall to Best buy.

Get Bro's phone case -his phone's in his jacket pocket, nice and hidden- and he gets me Mass Effect Andromeda despite the reviews (because i loved the original trilogy). We start working our way back to the food court. Dad's not quite done yet so we duck into a nearby store and go back to the salon a few minutes later. Dad's finished so we head back towards Best Buy because it's one of the only 2 stores that deals in computers, electronics and video games.

Not quite clear of the food court yet, when I see her. It's my mother and she gives me this look, and if looks could kill, I'd be dead where I stood. I freeze and start to freak out. She passes and I tell bro that we need to find to get dad and leave before she causes a scene -she gets off on causing a scene in malls I swear- but dad finds us first. We explain the situation and I'm freaking out worse, turns out it's a panic attack. Me and bro are told to sit on a bench while he finds our mother to talk to her. She caused a scene and storms out, shooting me yet another ""If looks could kill"" stare as she passes. Now I'm drawing attention to myself because my panic attack really starts to hit.

Dad tells me to chill and we head out to the car. We get out ahead of our mother in the traffic and drive the 30ish minutes home. At home, dad hears the voice mail she left and tells her what me and bro told her. She tries bullshitting saying she didn't know we were with him till she got behind us and saw my head in the car. Dad and bro say it's funny, considering she stared right at me twice in the mall and that i described her clothing almost perfectly to a T. Phone call doesn't end well.

Dad gets frustrated because I'm in the middle of a panic attack and i can't shop shaking and crying. Dad gets mad and asks what the hell my problem is and I finally admit to what out mother's done to us. Dad catches on that this is a panic attack and I'm not making this shit up. He tells me to go to my room and relax, probably by playing a video game or something. Then when I'm calmer, to write down everything I can remember mom doing to me or my brother. I follow his advice. When i come down for dinner, I'm light headed, i feel weak and I'm so hungry I could probably eat my weight in food if i didn't feel like i was going to puke. But he now has about an 8 page document printed out of what my mother's done over the years.

He takes 2 days to read it over and digest it. 3rd day he calls me down to talk and give me a hug. He can't believe all that was going on and he didn't know or see it. He feels like shit because he couldn't do anything, but now a lot more things make sense. Me and dad grow a little closer and i grow more confidence because I'm ready and more than willing to take care of this so I can move on and heal from it.

We finally go to the cops to report our mother's abuse. Because of the statute of limitations, cops can't do shit. Find out that the statute of limitations expired on my brother about a month ago so we can't even get her for her burning his neck (a few days before she left, she took the nightlight we have in our upstairs bathroom and pressed it to the side of my brother's neck, burning it. She told my brother that she ""didn't know it was hot"" which is bullshit, because when you pick it up by the plastic plug bit, you can feel the heat if it was recently turned on. Bro didn't tell us about it because he didn't think it was important at the time until after she left and we saw the red mark.) Cops are disgusted by her actions, even saying that they can't say much about her but the nicest thing they could say is ""she's not a very good mother"".

Cops investigate, even though she can't be charged, it's put on record in case we have more problems with her, and they say there's more than enough evidence for this investigation to show up on any criminal record checks she has done in the next 8-10 years (8-10 years from the time in 2016 meaning it will expire in 2024-2026). She won't have ton answer for her crimes, but it's a start on the road to healing.

I finally -and slowly- start telling my mother's family, starting with Cathy who was the next fair and level headed person after my Grampy. I don't fully trust her and she tells me i need mental health help (with a 2 year wait list and no coverage? Not down here, lots of luck). We suspect she told my nan because when I met with her in the parking lot of my jr high, my nan reads the document and basically calls me a liar saying ""if it happened"" (exact quote) and saying that ""if it happened"" she's talk to my mother about letting her stay with her. She also let slip that even if my mother lies, she -my Grandmother- ""will swear to it in court"" (another exact quote).

Finally, 2 weeks before school started for the 2017-2018 year, I felt ready to confront my mother. To this day, I'm always torn when i see or think of her. I'm torn between an intense burning hatred towards her when I almost want to fight her if i have to, or an intense and deep rooted fear where I'm ready to flee at a moment's notice. But i wanted to do it regardless because i knew it would help me heal. So we again met at the jr high i went to years ago -it's not far from my house- and i asked my mother what the fuck. she got into a heated match and normally, I'm not smart enough or sharp enough to get people to play into my hand or to play by my rules without manipulating people like she does. But as soon as she showed a fatal flaw of hers -wanting to get the last word in, especially while riled- the game was on.

I user her anger and loss on control when angry, as well as her desire to always get the last word in to keep her in the parking lot while I got her to answer my questions, or at least try to get something out of her. I don't take joy in it, but it worked way too well. Every time she's go ""fuck this"" and try to drive away, i'd shoot my face off and she's jam the breaks on, park and start screaming. I was riled up and uneasy but I had parked my ass under the security camera bolted to the wall of the school, and since I was on foot and my mother in a car with her jerky movements, even the people who lived across the street had an idea what was going on. I learned several things however:

1. If anything happened to dad, she was getting the house and if me and my bro had no where to go, she didn't care if we were out on the street.
2. my mother had called me at work and disrupted the afternoon after my brother had another seizure. She wanted details i didn't have and knew my brother didn't want giving out anyway. She wanted to put him on medication immediately (she was still pissed about me fighting my way off of Concerta at the end of Jr high and the doctor kicking her out of the exam room for that and all future appts with him... I was 15 when that happened) and when i told her our fear of my brother having a seizure and him getting sick and choking on it while on his back was almost realized -he luckily woke up and was on his feet when he started getting sick- she asked how it was her problem and she didn't really care (if she hadn't left and she was a mother, dad couldn't have found out hours after he left for work... Still upset that he took his seizure minutes after i left for work, and i couldn't help him.
3. She said that me and my brother knew jack shit thanks to dad and that my brother should know how to pay bills, know how to live on his own, be independent, look for an appt etc. all by 17 (my brother upon hearing what she said ""So she wants me to give up my education so I can struggle to survive because I don't know how to so this? thanks mom"")
4. She acknowledge that she abused me and even said ""Yeah so what? What do you want from me?"" When I suggested an apology, she told me that she did nothing wrong (the new status quo from ""the dark side"" As dad started calling her family, after hearing that i set mom's ringtone as the imperial march on my phone... why? because i like to think I'm funny.)

My mother later took off but not before i flipped her the double bird and cussed her out so badly that even a sailor would blush at my language. I got dad to pick my up on the way home so I could fill him in on what happened and because i needed to blow off steam. I told him i knew i shouldn't have cussed of flipped her off, but dad told me he didn't care because not only did I already recognize that i shouldn't have done it, but that she basically deserved it. He asked me how i felt about confronting her about it and i said i knew it was a waste of time and breath, but that it helped me feel better like a weight was lifted or at least eased off my mind and chest.

She typically has left us alone since then, excluding the scene her, nan and Nancy the snake tried to make at the graduation (dad had to take back what he said about me not being observant and thinking fast on my feet that night. I may seem dense at times, but I've helped him more than he likes to admit.) and when we discovered in late 2017 that my dad was executor of his father's estate -it was practically worthless by the time we found out thanks to drama in dad's side of the family.... long story there too- and my mother game to gloat to my father but that turned sour after she saw my Poppy's car in our yard -dad's lawyer said we could move it to our yard to monitor it- and tried to get to get the information on who owned the car.

By the time mom learned about us having the car in late 2017, early 2018, it was already cleared and was legally and registered in my name (went from my Poppy's name/ estate right to my name as my dad didn't want the car and could assign hat he didn't want to someone else so technically I inherited a car, a car my mother wanted me to have years before his passing anyway). She got pissed because it's a 2006 and it has under 100k on it in millage and we sunk a bit of money -we didn't really have- into it to fix the paint job and the dents on the passenger side.

**Backstory over**

**Now here's where I'm seeking Relationship advice:**

While at school the designated councilor told me that while it's my choice not to have a relationship with my mother or her family, I should anyway because she's my mother and they're my family (da faq?) while the lady who works with students with disabilities (she has a degree in dealing with mental health if I'm remembering the degree hanging on her wall correctly), said that it's my choice and while she personally thinks it's fine not to have one, it's also seen as good that i don't have one with my mother if it's going to hurt my mental health.

**TL;DR mom abused me for many years as well as my brother, destroyed a 25ish year old marriage and her and her family are fine with it and condone her behavior and the abuse, and continues to want to use the separation/ eventual divorce proceedings to hurt our family further.**

How do I explain to people that we don't have a relationship without her abuse making the topic awkward or without having to justify myself? How do I lessen the impact of negative reactions I get when i tell people i don't celebrate mothers day with my mother/ in a traditional way? How do I approach this topic with any future girlfriends?

Also there's a lot more info I wanted to add but it's already long enough. Sorry for any spelling or grammatical errors. it's 7am and I'm been writing for hours because nightmares and insomnia suck.",2019.0,1.0,23.0,01:01:48,victim
22,215,My (19F) boyfriend's (19M) dad (42M) is extremely abusive towards his family and now I don't want to come over or see his dad's face again.,28.0,agvyen,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/agvyen/my_19f_boyfriends_19m_dad_42m_is_extremely/,9.0,1547744937.0,"This is a long post, I apologize and tried to shorten is as much as I could, there's just a lot here. Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm on mobile, so please excuse any errors or formatting issues. TL:DR at the bottom. 

Ok, so my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years now. I've never had a problem with his parents until recently. My bf has a sister (16F) who is turning 17 next month. Their father, let's call him John, is married and has a spotty history of physical and verbal abuse with their mom (his wife). They tell me he's been a kind and award winning father while they were young. John hasn't given me or anyone else any problems until a few months ago. 

**some background**
John and his wife dated in high school and got married young. She had an abortion that scarred her and, from what John says, she neglected him for 11 years straight while she worked two jobs to support their two children (my bf and his sister) because of it. Now during this time of ""neglect"" he cheated on her twice, once with some neighbor, and then for two years straight with his best friend (married) who recently died. He fell in love with his best friend but stopped having an affair after the two years and stayed friends. (She even told him to run away and abandon his wife and two kids with her). 

During this time his wife had to act as the bread winner until the family finally moved and become situated in a new house. Now his wife had free time, only working one job, and started up some hobbies, the biggest being pin-up. She would try to get John to hang out with her and get involved, but he rejected and began neglecting her. This is how it's been for the past 5 years or so.

**The problem**
Now, about 3 months ago, John's best friend (ex-lover) died. He finally confessed to his wife about that instance of cheating. She admitted to him that she had been cheating too, but only for the past month with a co-worker (they're both prison guards). This sent John into a wild spin of abuse and horrendous emotional manipulation toward his wife. It interfered with the kids, their finances, and now my bf and I act as parents for his sister basically. Not only does John constantly emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abuse his wife, he also can't see his own hypocrisy. He thinks he's in the right. 

About a week or so ago, he finally came out saying how he cheated with other woman too (I personally only know about the two women, but there's supposedly more). He would manipulate his wife saying, ""you have no place to talk, I bought you expensive x and did y with you."" And her response would be, ""I know, I'm not saying anything... I'm just shocked is all."" 

Tonight is where he crossed the line and traumatized his whole family including me. My boyfriend and I were hanging out and his sister was doing homework. Their mom was asleep all day as she works night shifts. John, for whatever reason, keeps in contact with the wife of the man his wife slept with. She feeds him all this bullshit and wants to break their marriage apart. Apparently today she said something about what his wife and her husband did and John flipped his shit. He gets hung up on small SMALL details of her infidelity and manipulates her and makes her feel like shit for not coming out with every last tiny bit of the ""truth"" these past three months. He completely ignored the fact that it took him years to come clean to her, and then some too. 

So my boyfriend went to go get something and heard his mom screaming and confronted the situation. John was flipping out over this small shit. The sister gets involved and everyone is screaming so I run out there to make sure no one is getting hurt (I've been involved in their family fights before so this isn't entirely new). After some fighting with his wife and saying he would fuck the wife of the dude his wife cheated with, he proclaimed that he was going to leave the house and kill himself. He went into the safe and shut the door leading to it. His wife was wailing for him not to do it and to put the gun away. My bf and his sister rush to the door too and then after a few seconds I do too and get involved.

John now has a loaded gun and is saying he's going to kill the guy his wife cheated with. We all tell him he's not leaving with the gun and he threatens us saying he can, ""take out all of [us] if we don't get out of the way"". Thankfully, he didn't get physical like that. He did almost hit daughter when she tried to calm his down (CPS has been called before but no one says a word since he's the main income now). We eventually calm him down enough to make him put the gun away, but we can't prevent him from leaving so he leaves. 

His wife calls their marriage therapist and the therapist calls the police on the basis of protecting john from killing himself. Now the police are going to be coming to the house and John doesn't know. John also hates the police too. So we all wait and the wife calls her sister-in-law who sort of knows what's going on. The wife is too upset and can't explain it so my bf's sister talks to her in her room. John comes back and calls his wifes phone and his daughter comes running out with it and is terrified when she sees her dad. He grabs the phone and starts to hard core question everyone as to why she had her phone. The wife comes clean and John gets mad. The three of us (bf, sister, and me) leave at this point and wait for the police. 

The police show up, question us all (first time I had to do that) and they leave. Then John gets pissed at me saying I need to leave and tells the three of us that we're all idiots. 

We essentially hide out in the sister's room and eavesdrop on what's going on out there. My bf's Mexican grandma was suppose to come over the border next weekend and John made his wife call her and call it off. Not only that, but he fed her what to say to her mom about her own infidelity. Her mom is a very Catholic, old school lady with high moral values. John doesn't let his wife say anything to her mom about his infidelity and especially forces his wife to shame herself to her own mother. We heard lots of crying out there and we think they finally agreed to a divorce. 

So, my question is, how do my bf and I handle this. I don't want to come over and see him if his dad is at the house, which is every day when he gets home at 3pm. I can't see him on weekends now and we barely have time to see each other during the weekdays. John terrifies me and I never want to be in his presence again. He threatened me, put his whole family in a dangerous situation, and insulted me. He's crazy... their marriage is ruined, and I feel horrible for the wife. But my boyfriend and I agreed to make a post here to search for ways to make things work during this hard time and how to emotionally deal with this. 

If his parents get divorced, he doesn't know where he's going to live or who he's going to live with. Has anyone else been in this situation? If so, how did you get through and is there any hope? 

Again, sorry for the super long post. I'm not too good at simplifying things.

**TL:DR**
Bf's dad is extremely manipulative and abusive. He threatened me, insulted me, and put me and the rest of his family in a dangerous situation involving a gun. The police were involved, and I no longer want to be at their house or see their dad ever again. My bf and I want to know how to work our relationship around this. Is there any way to? Also any tips for getting over this type of emotional trauma? My bf, his sister, and I are all traumatized and don't know how to handle our emotions now.",2019.0,1.0,17.0,22:53:57,victim
23,220,Not sure what kind of relationship will truly be good for me and potential,2.0,apsxi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/apsxi5/not_sure_what_kind_of_relationship_will_truly_be/,1.0,1550004074.0,"I am a guy in my mid twenties. There are two women I am close friends with that I am interested in and attracted to who are extremely different in personality, maturity and character. I’m interested in pursuing a long term relationship, my primary focus would be long term happiness and satisfaction for myself and my partner. I’m quite conflicted when it comes to judging if the reasons why I am attracted to each one of them are healthy and would be helpful in a potential relationship. Both women have told me they are interested in me. Of course nothing is ever certain, however, I feel like I could genuinely decide to pursue one of them and we would be together in a short time. I would be really grateful for any advice from those of you out there with more experience than me!

Before I talk about them, I should probably put a word in about myself. I have an analytical personality. I value being challenged and growing from hardship. I’ve been working in high tech startups for 5 years. I’m a “dreamer”, a romantic if you will. Highly motivated, but often struggling to live up to my own expectations and to see plans become action. Despite this, I have had a lot of success in pushing myself to become a hard worker and professional. I don’t plan on stopping my efforts in developing my character in a healthy, sustainable way. Two years ago I made a transition from being a convicted Christian to no longer being able to believe in God. I began to understand the tendencies people have to reinforce their own biases based on intrinsic self defense mechanisms, which led to me losing my faith. I have always been painfully self aware, and that has led to having a conflicted personality as I saw the madness and lack of logic in myself and in people all around me. I often connect deeply and easily with people who are difficult,  “hard to get” and hard to understand,  have a deep compassion for people going through pain, probably because of how much I understand my own.

The first woman, let’s call her H (because she really has it together) is someone I respect so much. She is extremely intelligent, and emotionally intelligent as well. She can easily see through other people’s behaviors and understand what their motives and intentions are. We deeply connected from the moment we met because we had this in common. She is highly motivated and works very hard to keep her ambitions close to reality. She can also be extremely silly and carefree, and into “embracing the weird” as she see’s how much fake exists around and how hard people try and keeping it up.

The second woman, let’s call her B (because she is a very broken person) is quite the opposite. I met her when she was in a crises and was able to deeply connect to her pain. She has been through so much abuse, much of it self inflicted but I don’t think she has ever known better as the cycle began early in her childhood due to family abuse and unfortunate physical problems. She is provocative, says the most inappropriate things ever. Honestly one of the funniest people I have met. She is also very needy, emotionally and physically. But she is extremely shallow... she doesn’t understand my analytical side at all. I know she is capable of maturing in this area, but she has probably evaded it for years because it would require her to face so much of her own pain. She honestly wants to “get better” and self improve, but from the side it looks like she keeps falling into the same self destructive cycles of escapism.



Ok, so I am sure you are all thinking I am pretty much an idiot by now for not knowing what is the best choice here. The problem is I am thinking about a relationship... I know in a relationship with B, she would understand my own brokenness as I understand hers. I’m also a needy guy, but a whole lot stronger and more self disciplined than she is. I know she would adore me, and I would love her deeply. Does it make sense that I am attracted to her brokenness? To her neediness? Why is that a thing? Is it because she offers more “insurance”, more security in my self confidence of being strong and capable because of the contrast between us?

With H, I love so many things about the person she is and tries to be. I respect her so much, she honestly intimidates me with her intelligence. If we were together, we would be a power couple - supporting each other to be the best versions of ourselves. The thing I am afraid of is that she won’t understand my own brokenness. That her love won’t be as deep because she won’t need me as much. I am also afraid of not being able to live up to my own potential and letting her down.

Any thoughts or advice you guys might have would be appreciated. This is my first Reddit post. Looking forward to hearing from this awesome community!

24,222,Sister (F20) about to abandon entire family for abusive boyfriend (M26).,14.0,agc400,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/agc400/sister_f20_about_to_abandon_entire_family_for/,12.0,1547608786.0,"Ok. Strap in. It’s a long one. 


Let me explain to you the situation that is making me (F20) stress every single day. 

My sister (F22) and I have always been super close. Although, she has always been known for dating super shitty guys. But this one tops the cake. I have never despised someone more in my entire life. We will call him Matt. Matt (M26) is a soundcloud rapper who still lives in his parents basement and thinks he is a God. People who don’t support his “art” are just haters that he spit on one day when he makes it big. They started talking about a year ago, and immediately I did not like him. Matt made no effort to connect with my family, which was the first red flag considering how close we all are. Instead, he began isolating my sister from the rest of us. She started spending more and more time with Matt and would ignore all texts/calls from us while with him. I was not having it. I called her out on the sketchy behavior & which got back to him, eventually causing him to manipulate her to the point where she cut me out completely. Saying I was just trying to “destroy her happiness.” I was heartbroken, my best friend and sister had chose some bum over me. We didn’t talk for months, until one night one of her friends reached out to me and asked me to comeover because my sister was in a really bad mental state. She was drunk as hell and crying to the point she was hyperventilating. Long story short, Matt had been emotionally abusing and manipulating her to the point of a mental breakdown. I was furious. I took care of her & she told me she was done. It was very hard on her and she was in a really bad emotional state. One night I couldn’t get in contact with her and started to get really worried. I went to her place to check on her  only to walk in on her fucking Matt. I was furious. At that point, we stopped talking again. Fast forward and she ends up moving back in after her lease is up. Our whole family is still trying to get her to dump him at this point. He had cheated on her, is putting her into serious debt because his “art” wasn’t giving him a sufficient paycheck, and had driven her away from all her friends. Got to the point where one day she packed up and left and moved into his parent’s basement with him, because she couldn’t stand us ripping on the “love of her life.” It broke my Mom’s heart. All of us were still trying throughout this period to get her to leave him. ANOTHER fast forward to right before Christmas. She came back to the house one day hysterical. He had beaten the shit out of her. Choked her, dragged her across the room by her throat, etc. My family finally put our foot down and told her she is NOT going back there and NEVER speaking to him again. My Dad and I went to the house and got her stuff. He continued to harass and stalk her through any platform he wasn’t blocked on, though. Sending her bullshit about how he was going to “propose, and marry her, have a ton of kids with her because she was the only one for him.” But my family and I were ecstatic she was finally done with him. I got her a new job through my work, paid a ton of her debt off for her to help her get back on her feet, and gave her endless emotional support. Things seemed fine for awhile until New Years. I knew she was lying to me about where she was. I sat on this information for a couple weeks while observing more sketchy things happening. So, I stole her phone and looked at her texts. (I know, I know, invasion of privacy, but I genuinely was concerned for her safety after noticing some things I don’t feel comfortable sharing here.) 

But, my suspicions were sadly real. She only really stopped talking to him for a couple days after the incident. Ever since then, they have been looking at places to move out together and to get married. Worst part is, she knows she is going to lose everyone in our family and she doesn’t care. He is all she wants. 

This is my sister. My best friend. I see her making the worst decision of her life and I don’t know what to do. I haven’t confronted her about anything, because I know that will just send her straight to Matt. But at the same time, how much more energy can I put into a situation where she’s already betrayed me and made her decision? ",2019.0,1.0,16.0,09:04:46,victim
25,225,"Me (M, 25) with colleague (F, 27) accidentally started a relationship. She has many issues and I'm wondering if this is salvageable. Warning: huge wall of text and many dramas",0.0,avaaxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avaaxu/me_m_25_with_colleague_f_27_accidentally_started/,0.0,1551278380.0,"So for a little bit of background I, AG (25, M) have been working in a business for almost 2 years now. For a bit of background about myself I a university educated, musically creative, with a strong work ethic and dedication to both my career and extracurricular hobbies; which I may plan to one day make my full time career. Despite having quite outgoing characteristics often being known as quite the party animal, often found at weekends clubbing with many of my closest friends whom I share a love of music with. I also suffer with bipolar disorder which I have become quite aware and mindful of over the years my ""phases"", how they affect me and how to minimise this. Recently have been suffering for the first time in my life from large bouts of anxiety which has taken a toll on my work, hobbies, relationships and pretty much every aspect of my life - this has unfortunately hit me at the same time as a down phase of my bipolar, essentially bringing myself into a kind of isolationist depression. I think I'm suffering a little from burnout and have needed a low stress break from everything for a little while.   

MY (F, 27) joined my workplace (a well respected resteraunt) around 8 months ago and made very good impressions all around. She is extremely charismatic especially with customers, is professional and is willing to go the extra mile for anyone. Many customers and staff have frequently made positive comments to myself, head office or other managers and she quickly rose to a supervisory managerial position, essentially the same level as me for front of house, whilst I manage the kitchen. When she started she was currently dating her long time bf JC (M, 27?). The two of us were good friends at work, nothing more and at that time definitely didn't see each other as anything more, as although both of us were extremely friendly towards each other we didn't actually share many things in common. One thing mentioning is that she has many visible self-harm scars - although it's nobody's place to ask she has always been open about her MH struggles in the past particularly with depression, anxiety and is now recovered and functioning.   

Soon the drama stars.   

Essentially MY comes to work clearly visible with bruises, she confides in me (as one of the people closer to her at work) that JC has been physically abusive. After years of various abusive behaviour she'd essentially cracked and ended up sleeping with another guy. She was very ashamed with herself and did tell JC who at that point was physical. The police were involved and it was all a bit messy although she put on a brave face at work and our boss was very understanding. They split and she ended up living with a friend who is a wonderful guy and has since been single and had a fair share of one night stands - fair enough from my view I'm not very judgemental, quite promiscuous myself and imo it was probably good to get some of that out of her system. We often swapped stories of our latest escapades and bonded over this.  

So a few months later after work one day we agree to go for a drink together. As I'm sure you guessed one thing led to another and we were unexpectedly back at my place. We both go into work the next day and it becomes quickly obvious what's happened, word and drama spreads around. We decide to just roll with things and see how they go with no real commitment. Despite this we end up seeing each other almost every day and it's quite clear by Christmas/NY that's it's a ""thing"" and starting to get serious. Work colleagues are now mostly bored of it and overall things are good and chill between us.   

Its around mid January that I have my bad bipolar/anxiety dip. I take some time off work and try to heal at home. MY assures me that she will support me in any way I can, and just need to recover and relax. Great! Probably exactly what I needed. However it was also around this time (probably because I was no longer in work) that I noticed MY would go out for ""a few drinks"" after work quite often, usually starting on payday and would continue for several days usually until there was a minimal amount of money in her bank to survive - often relying on me to fund her or lend money when low.   

Now to clarify I never had an issue with going for a few drinks after work. I myself often go clubbing on weekends and indulge myself as a stress release and social bonding mechanism and I have always been a fairly carefree, not prone to jealousy type of person.   

But I notice several strange things around this time. Firstly her mental health severely deteriorates one she's had a few drinks. I strongly suspected Borderline Personality Disorder BPD (although ianap) because my own mother displayed very similar tendencies. She takes quite strong MH medication which works well until she has a drink and it becomes quite clear that her handling of people/emotions/certain situations just isn't quite right. It's very hard to describe over text but there's just a glint in her eye that gives away that something is not quite ticking correctly in her head. I notice this pattern and it beings to worry me. She has a dark side to her personality which often she will talk about abuse/suicide/positions she's been in which have been horrible in some way and it's a total flip from the bright lovely sober her.   

I also notice that some of the things she tells me aren't quite adding up. Who she is with, where she is, how late she is staying out ect. Again I'm pretty carefree but combined with the above I'm starting to grow a concern for her. To top it all off she seems to have reconnected with her abusive ex JC and they seem to occasionally meet up (in the company of friends?), which I'm not over the moon about, but I try and understand her care over someone who she had such history with and how this might help them both see past things.   

There became a few incidences where she ends up staying out all night due to drinking, the first staying at a friends house. The next time she confessed that she stayed with her ex but they were just talking as he has many problems himself, was wasted and just needed someone to tuck him in whilst she slept on the sofa. It was at this point where I confronted her on a) her problem with alcohol, her behaviour when drunk and general lack of self control and b) how her staying at JCs house is perceived by myself at home alone and suffering from anxiety. Overall a difficult conversation but she admitted the alcohol issue, dependance and how it affects me and her BPD ect.   

Things were OK for a week or so, she would come straight home so as to avoid post work drinks, and the one or two times she strayed she kept me in the loop about where she was, coming home time ect. OK I thought, this is progress and we can go from here. We can recover together and be sober together. Unfortunately there was a day when MY messaged me saying that JC had broken his rib, was refusing to go to hospital and needed care. It was at this point that I laid down the boundary that he either needed painkillers and to relax or get an ambulance as there is nothing you can do that either of these options will not solve. My gut reaction was off the charts and I knew something was off. She refused to pick up my calls and I said if she didn't come home that was the end of us. The next morning I received about one million messages apologising, explaining she was caring for someone who she still cared about and wants to help the world. I agreed to listen and have a conversation the next evening and we agreed that she needed serious help with the drinking and not to see JC as he's a toxic influence.   

Things basically continue like this for a little while with things kinda better. She comes home late and drunk again, passes out and there was something about her story that she mumbled to me which didn't add up at all. I felt pretty horrible for doing this but I couldn't take it any longer. I checked her phone messages and lo and behold she had been sleeping with JC, often meeting in secret, and there had been to many lies and gaslighting to bother writing here. I took photos and woke up MY saying I was going to stay with a friend and left the house. I was pretty upset but also in a serious fuck this shit kinda mood. Again I woke up to one million messages.   

I ended up going to see my close friend and we got a little bit messy together but it was good for the soul. Meanwhile MY had a complete mental breakdown (possibly due to the sheet amount of alcohol drunk) and without going into details there was some seriously nasty abusive stuff from her end and her behaviour ended up having to call the police to get her removed from my house, and she ended up not turning up to work the next day which is a big no-no. 

At this point I was completely ready to wash my hands with this. After the weekend it was clear from the way she talked, messaged and behaved that she knew she had some some serious wrong (to me probably the one person in her life who has never emotionally or physically abused her). I don't know why but I thought that maybe my messages had finally got through to her and that she needed to seriously change her ways and get help. There was something about the way it was said that was so genuine that I took it as true. We ended up reconciling when she came to pick her stuff up and we agreed to do things differently. To confess I once hurt somebody I cared about very deeply and since then I was a changed person as I needed to believe in the power of redemption for myself. I like to believe the way I have lived since has reflected that and that this was now possible to do with MY with some guidance and support from me.   

Since then we managed to get MY to the doctors (who she finally opened up to) and referred to an alcohol help support thing, but to me none of these services have even been much use or seem to have taken the seriousness of the issue to heart?! Like she basically needs to stop as she has zero self control, has also built up an extensive social circle around pubs/bars and the people that frequent them and now can't understand that not drinking =/ boring, or that she can see her friends in other places than bars or even she can go but stay sober. It's taking a serious toll on me as I'm spending so much time and energy at home worrying about her after work. It's got to the stage where I will have to physically be there after work and walk/uber her home, but obviously I can't do this every day. I really do care for her and she has so many amazing qualities which I've neglected to mention here and I'm trying my absolute best to help her change and guide as I genuinely believe she can change and we can make this work, but I feel the trust, respect and basically every foundation of a successful relationship has been really fundamentally broken and needs to be rebuilt.   

I've had some more suspicious ideas recently about MY and how she's using her phone, I checked again last night and there was some messages from JC. Now there's nothing explicit or terrible there, but I have asked her to cut him off as part of our reconciliation. Given his abusive history, and also her cheating on me with him - I don't think this is an unreasonable request. He simply is toxic and I mentally cannot deal with him having any place in either of our lives if we are to try and repair this. She claims he is now a friend and they will not meet in person but she just can't cut him out. I'm trying to see this middle ground here but honestly there isn't one for me here. If she can't cut out toxic and change that then how on Earth am I meant to trust her to change or do anything about the much more serious and problematic alcohol issues? We've just had a lovely day together, the lovliest in ages - and I've found this and I'm sat awake at 6am with no idea if I should pack my bags and go finally or just try one more time. It's not the biggest issue ever but it's still a breach of trust and I just don't know if I can continue to live with someone like this. I genuinely believe she is a sociopath like both her and my mother, but one who does care for me and I'm wondering if it's worth bothering to try and change someone or if indeed it is possible and worth it.   

To top everything off we somehow have to work together as I'm back in two days and this adds further confusion for me.  I think I just needed to write this all out, and if anyone has any similar stories or some insights/perspective I'd be eternally thankful.

My sister [22F] and I have more or less grown up with my cousins.  Two girls[18] & [17] and one boy[20] prior to a family break about 10 years ago. We got back into contact 5/6 years ago and seeing that side of the family as an adult made me realize how cruel, manipulative and batshit crazy they are.... To others. They've been nice to me, which gives me emotional whiplash. I don't know what to do. 


I tried to summarize but it's difficult. My father's side of the family is/was various ranges of narcissistic. They take advantage of my father's skills as a mechanic for free labour, and get offended over extremely small things. I should note they all hate my mother because she isn't afraid to call out their BS (but never did so around us kids. In fact, years later I'm still prying the whole story out of her. It's not a flattering one for her inlaws). 


The loss of contact 10 years ago was because they left my cousins at our house two days before Christmas while they partied. Which my mother wouldn't have minded, except that all three of them had the flu and spend most of the days hurling.
Exhausted, my mother politely asked them to go home after noon on Christmas day so we could have some close family time as well. They were so offended that they woke up their kids and left in the middle of the night - didn't even take their presents with them. I didn't see my cousins again for at least 5 years. My father did though. They would host birthday parties for him that only he was invited to.
There are many more stories about them manipulating my dad to the point of almost divorce but that's not why I'm here.



You see, my sister and I always suspected that side of the family abuses animals. Weirdly (?) enough this was eventually the final straw for me. They've always had dogs even though my aunt clearly despised them. I pieced this together later, but it was clear they didn't care much about animals. They kicked their dogs, giving them away periodically after a couple years of ownership. My cousins had gerbils they kept for 3 years, then casually gave them to a friend to be fed to their pet snake. 


So already my sister and I started to suspect our cousins are not as sweet as they seemed. Our aunt and uncle we wrote off as crazy ages ago, but we'd been earnestly cultivating relationships with our cousins.



Then came Rosie. A small fluffy mutt that my youngest cousin bought 4 years ago. Sweetest thing I'd ever laid eyes on. Gentle and affectionate, and very smart. The things they did to this dog... Never bathed her, beat her, locked her in a closet all day for God knows how long while they were home because they couldn't stand how much she smelled. The only credit I can give them is they fed her and let her out to pee. Oh yes, and forgot her outside for sometimes an entire day. This is the countryside where predators roam, no fences with her being a small lap dog.


 But I didn't know about all this until much later. They made excuses when we were over. ""It was a busy week and we couldn't wash her."" ""She cowers because she doesn't like strangers."" ""She flinches because she's shy.""
We bought Rosie from them about 2 years later. We were looking to adopt a young dog from a shelter, but when my aunt heard our plans she offered Rosie, saying ""We don't really want her anymore. [Male cousin] offered to drop her off in the woods, we might just do that."" She was dead serious.



Once we bought Rosie, we noticed she was tender around the ribs. That was because they fucking broke her ribs. We didn't find out until later, it took ages to figure out why she yelped if not picked up with the gentlest of touches. We thought she was just afraid of being hit. She was terrified and desperate for affection, and had severe separation anxiety (because she was locked in a fucking closet). I love this dog and knowing what she went through makes me absolutely furious. She's happy and safe now, at least. But after we got her, my aunt started admitting to all the things they used to do to her, often with a laugh and a smile as though it were some big joke. 


My sister and I, loving our cousins, tried in our hearts to blame just our aunt and uncle for the neglect. We confronted my older cousin (the 18F one) about the abuse, the broken ribs, the anxiety and fear we had to train out of Rosie and she laughed in our faces.
""Yeah, I never gave a shit about that dog."" 
These were the exact words she used. I was struck speechless. I guess I shouldn't have been so optimistic, but what can I say? She's my cousin and I care about her. 


Now they're over for family functions more often. 10 years later, after the deaths of my narcissistic grandmother and her poor golden child (my second aunt) , my aunt finally 'forgave' my mother enough to start visiting.


I don't know how to act around them. I feel completely lost on what I should do. I want to hate them so much. They try to coax Rosie on their laps when they are over and say shit like ""How can anyone not love this dog?"". Easy to say now that she smells clean, acts confident and secure that she is safe, and is affectionate without acting desperate. My aunt often expresses shock that the dog doesn't piss on the floor anymore (which she used to do when seeing my aunt) with such sincerity that I'm left speechless.

They act so normal, and treat my sister and I almost as nice as my other cousins, except without the whole birthday/Christmas present thing.... Okay, we aren't as close, but we'd been in the process of reconnecting when my family recieved Rosie. 




How do I reconcile this with what I know about them? My dad only has them left in his family, everyone else is dead so I know if I told him I don't want to see them he'd be absolutely crushed. But treating them nicely when I see them makes me feel like I'm betraying my dog and rewarding them for their asshole behaviour towards all of my family (and dogs in general) including my parents. 

In my worst moments I almost wish someone would beat them up like they beat up Rosie, broken ribs and all. But I know that's wrong...  I do care about my cousins despite this. I don't actually want them to get hurt, but I'm so angry with them.

For the issues with my parents, I long accepted it as shitty behaviour my parents accept, so I just stay out of it. But this animal abuse is sort of the last straw for me. To me, it turns them from selfish family members to psychopaths unable to empathize with living things. 


What should I do? I need some perspective on what's a normal reaction. I don't know how to feel. Please help. :(


TD;LR Aunt and Uncle treat my mom like shit, manipulate my dad as the last of his family. Found out my cousins knew how badly their parents were abusing their pets and perhaps even did so themselves with no remorse to speak of. I don't know what to do with this information.

He was very controlling and when i broke up with him, he tormented me for weeks until i got a restraining order. It was terrifying for both my family and I. It left me with a LOT of issues feeling safe. I had ignored the glaring red flags for our whole relationship. And it really hurt knowing a guy i loved for over 2 years could torment me like that.

I've casually dated in the past 3 years, i've had FWBs and all, but nothing has ever been exclusive or serious. But my family, friends & coworkers have taken note that I am **extremely** selective with the people i let into my life. I've stopped dating various guys for very minimal reasons. I don't wait for red flags, i bail at yellow ones. 

With that in mind, i've been dating this guy for about a month now. I really like him, he really likes me. We're very compatible and for once i can see a relationship lasting long term with someone. We've been discussing the logistics of a relationship.

I happily told my family and was immediately met with a LOT of doubt. They asked me a lot of questions, work history, family life, where'd he grow up at, etc. They even went on to ask me how i could trust him. ""You were with [ex] for two years and you see how that turned out""

They really made me question my judgement. I went from being excited about the relationship forming, to wanting to hide away again. Now i just don't know what to do. I didn't notice red flags in my last relationship, what if i'm doing that again? Once you've experienced domestic violence, you're even more likely to get into another abusive relationship. <- that was a fact i read somewhere years ago that i keep thinking about now.

I don't know what to do. It's not like anybody on here can tell me whether or not he's been displaying red flags. How do victims of DV move on to form healthy relationships?? Are there books/resources someone can point me towards? 

I guess in the meantime i should pump the brakes on the relationship. This fucking sucks. I thought i made so much progress and now i feel like i'm right back to being scared of my own shadow. And it makes me mad for so many reasons. And i'm going to stop ranting about this cause it's giving me anxiety.

Long story short I dated this boy for three years, met senior year of high school and dated until my junior year of college. While I was in school I lived about two hours from our home town (and will do so until May). He had a history of eating disorders, family abuse, depression, etc. I had a history of none of these things. Which was fine. I loved him and it worked for a while.

This is long but I feel it is relevant. As I started coming back from college breaks I kept unraveling all these secrets. He began doing hard drugs, had failed a consecutive three years of community college (we are talking English 101 and Psych 101, folks... 6 times), been fired from multiple jobs for not showing up. It became clear that our lives were taking different paths when I accepted a full time job offer that would require me to move states when I graduated college. He also became very emotionally abusive and would block me on every website, block my number, and physically threaten me. His threats never said “I’ll punch you or kill you”, but he would try to “man up” on me by standing taller, yelling, or idk... you get the idea. I began getting scared and dumped him over text. I told him I never wanted to see him again, which he didn’t take well. 

He had severe issues with his mental state while we were dating which became worse after. A mutual friend told me he had a severe mental breakdown and began posting crazy shit all over FB about girls he asked out in high school, how he poured bleach in his moms drinks, and about his family members molesting each other. Yesterday, he called me about 90 times after no contact for a year. I answered because this was unusual, and he was acting like we were still dating... I told him I was sorry, I didn’t want to meet with him because it was healthier for both of us to be apart. He begged me so I said “ok, I’ll meet you for lunch in a public place”. That made him upset which made me scared to even talk to him in the first place. When we hung up he said “I love you”, which I ignored.

Tonight while I was out he showed up in my drive way as my mom was coming home. He stood behind her car and he said “I wasn’t expecting to see you here”. And then my mom invited him for reasons I do not know. She said he was shaking, crying, talking about how I “broke up with him yesterday” and how he wasn’t doing good. My mom said she held his hand, and he told her about some other fucked up shit in his family.  My mom tried to keep him from leaving and asked him if he was on drugs but he repeatedly said no. I do believe that is possible due to his mental instability. However now I am wondering how to approach him / the situation. I am scared he will hurt himself or his family, because he mentioned how much he hates them on the phone yesterday. But more importantly I am worried about the safety of myself and my own family. He knows where I go to school, what car I drive, where my friends live.

Am I over reacting? Something feels incredibly wrong. I considered calling police but not sure if they can even help. I feel contacting his parents would make the situation worse. They have a track record of being fucking horrible people. Or maybe they don’t? Idk what to believe about him anymore. Any advice is welcome. 

TLDR; my ex has severe mental issues, contacted me after a year of NC, now I am scared of him.

There are many tidbits of tiny, but important events and information that contribute to the big picture, but that would mean writing a 5000 word infuriating essay on shitty people, poor life decisions and horrible financial responsibility.

Instead I'll skip all that and give you a basic introduction and then dive into the problem. Skip to the problem in bold if you're uninterested in background.

The current situation is this. My GF's [F24] grandfather [M~70] owns a house. It's a fairly large house, but since he's built it himself over some 20 years and his mantra of life is ""cheaper is better, you didn't need that much cement anyway"", the house is literally dying. Water pipes are rusting and need changing, electricity is going haywire, the house is holding heat very poorly and winters are cold and the furnace - inefficient. Solving these problems would take a capital maintenance effort and would cost half of a whole new apartment or a third of a house.

I didn't know any of this, or how abusive my GF's family was (neither did she at the time, things just seemed normal for her) when I moved in 3 years ago. Life was alright anyway, for most of the time, but it's getting a bit too much lately.

The grandfather himself doesn't live in the house. My GF's mom [F~50] and her younger brother [M~11] live with us, so it's essentially 4 people in the house. The house is large, though, so there should be enough space for everyone.

The arrangement actually mostly seems reasonable. The house is 3 stories high with a basement, 1st floor is the garage, 2nd floor is kitchen, bathroom, living room and 4 other rooms, 3rd floor is attic/mansard floor. Me and GF have a half of the mansard floor as our bedroom and then one of the rooms in the 2nd floor as a utility room.

I won't delve into vast details, but we've taken our share of responsibility over the house (both chores and financials), we've tried our best to stay out of everyone's way, but all the time someone on the GF's side of family believes they know better how we should live and act very intrusively. GF's mother is a toxic manipulator and has alienated the rest of GF's family from her by lying. Only reason we aren't bothered by it and never acted earlier was because it's no loss - the rest of the family isn't much better either, so their alienation is more or less actually a benefit.

Either way, we've decided we want to move out. I won't go over the reasoning, as there are several major reasons, but the decision is made.

**Problem is that me and my GF provide a majority of the financial support needed for the house.**

I alone bring in three times the money my GF's mother does and we've taken a brunt of the financials around the house so far. If we leave, they are in quite a fucked situation. I know we don't owe them nothing, if anything - they owe us. But if we leave, they'll be in actual trouble. They've been nothing but shit towards my GF, so I'd say good riddance, but it still feels like we'd be screwing them over.

I'm currently covering our asses and making sure they have nothing on us legally, so that aspect is covered. I'm more interested in any advice regarding on breaking the news and dealing with the fallout. The mother is extremely comfortable right now, and this will throw her nest upside down, there will probably be fallout and a lot of behind-the-back fake stories on what we did.

tl;dr

Sharing a house with GF, her abusive mother and her 11 year old brother. House is owned by her grandfather. We've had enough and we are moving out. GF's mother is living a very comfortable life on the account of manipulating other people, but we've been a major financial support regarding the house. If we leave, they can't keep up the house, especially not through winter. They're also horrible with money.",2019.0,1.0,8.0,02:02:18,victim

Julie (my wife, 27F) and Tanya (her sister) are extremely close. Years of family abuse left them hanging on to each other for a long period of time until finally when my wife turned 18, she took her sister and they both ran. 

I've been with my wife for 7 years now, we got married last year and honestly, I've never felt happier in my life. Julie is really the most amazing person you could ever meet. We do have our fights here and there but it's never something too serious. I do love my wife and would never even think for a second to ruin our relationship. 

Now as you've read from the title, something happened today. I've said that I was with Julie for 7 years and I have practically watched Tanya grow up right in front of me. She was polite and charming young girl (she still is) but I've never thought about her being something more than my wife's sister and I have never given any indication that I look to her like something else. 

Tanya has been staying with us for the past couple of days. Julie and I have our own place while Tanya still lives in the old apartment that they both used to live before. She has been going through a rough break up with her bf of 4 years and my wife offered her to come and stay with us for a while, 'till she feels better. 

Tany has been doing fine but she is still very heartbroken over her breakup. My wife would usually deal with her sister but I would often talk to Tanya as well, reassure her that it's gonna be fine, that she will get over him etc. But today was a bit different. 

Tanya was crying a bit more than usual. I heard her sobbing once I got back from work and it really made me feel bad about her. So I've decided to sit and just have a conversation with her. It really did help because she stopped crying and even cracked a few smiles at my attempts to lighten up the mood. As I would find out, today was supposed to their 4th year anniversary and this was the reason for her emotional outburst. 

We've talked a bit more and things got out of hand. In hindsight, I should have seen it coming, like when she switched the conversation to me, how I am a great guy and how her sister is truly lucky to have found someone like me. How she dreams of meeting someone like me, how she would occasionally touch my hands, snuggle closer to me. It's truly baffling how I didn't see it coming and I feel awful about it. 

She kissed me and after a second or two I pulled away from her in complete shock. She looked equally terrified as well. I jumped like I just got burned and Tanya immediately went ""Don't tell Julie"" and ran to her room. After maybe an hour, she had already packed her stuff, thanked for the hospitality and left. 

I was left alone to process what the fuck just happened. All that is going through my head right now is ""What the Hell did I just did?"". I felt like I've just cheated on my wife, with her own sister on top of everything. Also for some reason, I feel like I've taken advantage of that poor girl. It's completely irrational and doesn't make sense yes I know, but it's how I feel. Like I've said, I should have seen this. I should have picked up on the subtle hints and remove myself from the situation. But I didn't and in the end, we both screwed up.

My question here is, how do I even begin to explain this to Julie? Do I even try and explain this to her? I know that if I hide this, for now, it will only maybe cause an even bigger shitstorm in the future if this comes out, somehow. So Reddit, what do I do now?
I've never felt this confused in my life and I definitely need help in this.

I live close to my Mom and Aunt. My Mom and Aunt share a house. My aunt has become increasingly aggressive. She's picking fights, slamming doors, stomping around the house. She threatened to make up a story about my step dad hitting her and calling the cops when confronted about her unwarranted anger. She constantly picks fights, then later twists the story when telling other family members to make herself look better. I have caught her in multiple lies and when I defend myself or my mother she explodes - to the point she raised her fist to punch me.

It's frustrating because the rest of our family only ever sees what I call ""her pageant face"". She will act completely normal and only ever show the very best version of herself. This causes the rest of the family to think Mom and I are overly emotional. 

It's become so hostile I've severed all contact with this aunt. I'm 8 months pregnant and she has brought too much unnecessary stress into my life, I have choosen to bow out of all family functions she attends for the foreseeable future. The rest of the family seems to think I'm being dramatic, again, they don't ever see the true toxic crazy that she is day to day. They only every get the super happy version that loves everyone and everything is good vibes and koombya bullshit. 

She has been off work for 8 years for mental illness. She tells the family it's just depression and PTSD but there has to be more to it. She hits every single marker for BPD. She's aggressive, she blows up over very small things. She has no self awareness and takes absolutely ZERO accountability for her actions. She's very manipulative, will change how a series of events played out in an argument to make herself the victim every single time. She, when confronted, either explodes or tries to spin the situation into her some how being the victim. The gaslighting is unreal.

I feel awful for my Mother. She's stuck living under the same roof. They are selling the house, thankfully. But have to live together in the mean time. My mom has been stuck hiding in her bedroom day and night to avoid any contact with her. 

Is there anything we can do to navigate these rough rapids? Any tips on how the handle someone with BPD and the mental and verbal abuse? It sucks that we have come to the point we will remove ourselves from family functions she attends to spare ourselves the grief. 

TL;DR: aunt is suspected to have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and her aggressive and manipulative antics has made my and my mother's lives hell. The rest of the family never sees this side and they think we're being over dramatic

My father was abusive towards my mother, and now my older brother is also abusive to his wife. I personally consider myself pretty passive and soft-hearted and I've never abused anyone in any of my relationships. My aunts say that the ""women in our family have the victim gene"" and ""the men in our family have a mean streak."" I've heard this since I was a child.

I have been dating my boyfriend ""Nate"" for over a year now and we are talking about getting engaged lately. My family knows about him and have met him a few times and have generally had a good opinion about him. I mentioned to them in the past that he also comes from a broken family (father was in and out of jail, there was also a lot of physical abuse going on, etc) When I told them that we are considering marriage, they were disapproving about it.

I told them that he has never been disrespectful towards me and I trust him. He has also been through therapy for his childhood issues and has healthy outlets (he plays baseball/softball, exercises a lot, doesn't drink or smoke.) My family, namely my aunt and mother, say that his ""true side,"" ""nature"" will come out after we're married because that is in his blood (referring to his father.) They also dislike the fact that he is very tall and large (about 6'4"") because they think that means he naturally has more testosterone and animal-like behaviors and will inevitably use his strength against me.

As you can tell, my family doesn't think about things so much with a psychology mindset, but more with generational wisdom and experience. I understand their worries and fears. They have all had very hard lives and sacrificed a lot to make sure I had the best childhood possible, even when it was barely possible. My mom in particular feels a lot of guilt for how my brother turned out because he suffered the brunt of my dad's abuse when I was still a baby. I think they are all trying to shield me from danger... but it's making me feel confused and anxious instead.

I love my boyfriend and it is true that I have never felt any abusive tendencies from him. Is it possible that there could be some sinister ""gene"" inside him? Or is that all wive's tales? Is it right to be cautious? When I tell my family that he has never, ever done anything bad to me, they always combat that to say that it will be different once you get married and he has you locked down... so it's basically like, you can never tell until you're actually legally bound and it's too late. So how would I be able to tell who is ""good"" and who is ""just waiting"" to show his true colors? 

TLDR: Family worried about me marrying my boyfriend who comes from a bad childhood, mostly because my family has a history of abuse as well and worries that abuse breeds abuse, especially for women.

My Mother was always fawning over my brothers beautiful girlfriend, giving her lavish gifts, inviting her on girl dates with her, and calling her, her daughter...gag. 

Whenever she would come around she would jokingly belittle my brother in front of his family- at the time we didn't think much of it since my family is big on jokingly dogging on one another. However the stuff she would mention was inappropriate- ""Yeah your brother has a porn addiction."" Or ""I call him 2 second timmy."" 

When we'd ask him about their relationship he'd play it off however soon after he confided that she refused to be intimate and would become enraged if he watched porn- so he had to hide it. Weird and controlling behavior, but it got worse. As their relationship deteriorated, at this point they were basically roommates- she discovered he had saved images of another girl he was friends with in a bikini on his phone. Not too weird but our sister was also in the image. Molly then texted said girl about his saved image of her, saying horrible things like, ""he probably masturbated to this.... and look his own sister is in the background he probably masturbated to her too. 

My brother then later confessed through tears that she says horrible things to him, says horrible things about our family, and belittles him any chance she can. The weird part is that my Mother through all this, has insisted that she is still ""family."" I however pointed out that if her daughters male boyfriends had treated us the same that she would cut off contact. 

Her response is that she wouldn't, as to her both parties are to blame. One for being abusive and the other for staying. She refuses to condemn the blatant abuse her own son has received, and even goes so far as to invite her over still for the holidays. (Thankfully Molly has the grace to come over before anyone gets there just to visit with my Mother, and leaves before we arrive.) 

My brother has been emotionally damaged from this relationship, he lost a good deal of self esteem and even went on anti depressants. We still don't know the full extent of the abuse he received as he refuses to talk about it. However here still my Mother just texted our whole family about how ""MOLLY HAS A STRANGE MASS ON HER PELVIS LET'S ALL PRAY IT'S NOTHING, AFTER ALL SHE'S STILL FAMILY AND WE DON'T TURN OUR BACKS ON FAMILY"" 

Is there any way I can make her understand the emotional hurt my brother has received? Or possibly make her less obsessed with Molly? 

TL;DR : My brother's abusive ex girlfriend is still treated as family by my mother who still invites her to holidays and I can't make her understand how wrong it is to her son who is still dealing with the emotional trauma. ",2019.0,1.0,14.0,10:15:59,victim

I actually got into some top-tier schools for it,  and I asked if that was something he'd be okay with. He told me yes.  When I met him he had commitment issues and problems with talking about  anything involving our future, which would cause an argument.

A  year and a half into our relationship, (we are very committed at this  point and have a dog and a home that we rent together) he says that he  doesn't want to move. I keep pressing him to have a conversation about  this, kids, different aspects of our future, etc., but again, at the  time, not very emotionally mature, insisting we will ""talk about this  when the time comes"".

He's ready to talk about these things now, and we're supposed to have a discussion today about all the aspects of our futures that we want answers on. I want to go into animation, and can easily supplant our living in California, as I'll be in Web/Software development for at  least another 2 years at a Fortune 500 Company starting July, and will likely be able to get a transfer to the company's California branch while in school. He's a foreman in the pipe-fitting/sprinkler side of the construction industry (so he will  have no issue getting a job) who wants to go into mechanical or alternative-fuel engineering (to give an idea of our life goals I  guess). Money and finding jobs should not be an issue for us in a few  years when we move. I want to live in California indefinitely, but he's terrified of leaving his family (who, may I add, are completely  financially independent, so there's no family emergency or dying family  member or struggling relative he needs to stay for). He, not being a  very forward thinking person, suggests a few days ago, ""Why don't we  just stay for you to go to college and move back?"" Sure, I'll just move  back after getting my 28k/yr degree that can literally only be used in a handful of places... right. So that's absolutely not an option(nor is  any kind of long-distance). He's a very bright guy but grew up in a very  small town where most of the population succumbs to drug use. No one  moves or leaves. He claims he wants to be out of that life (we don't  live there now, 20 minutes away) and over the years having a distance  from it has changed his mindset little by little, but right now I think  he's just scared of any kind of change. He's willing to move but any  agreement or option always ends in, ""But then we move back to Georgia,  right?"". It doesn't make any sense for me considering he could get a  much better paying job and more opportunities in Cali for the industry  he wants to go into. I've been willing to make compromises and meet in the middle in various ways for him but he can't seem to fathom anything but living in Georgia forever for not other reason than, ""It's what I'm used to.""

Have  any of you been in this kind of situation(living across the country  from family)? What made it work? How did you block out/decide on  vacations and how to visit family, etc.  I have pretty much no relationship with my family (abusive) so this is no issue for me. Thanks  in advance!

**TLDR: I want to move to California for school and a career (that is more or less specific only to Southern California). My boyfriend and I are trying to work out the logistics of this, but because of his fear of change, he's agreed to go, but every scenario we work out together is less compromise and more ""We move, and then we move back home in like, as soon as you graduate."" Need help coming up with ideas on how to make family visits and that sort of thing work to make this more palpable for him I guess.**",2019.0,1.0,6.0,12:04:13,victim

When I was a child I was banned from playing with toy guns by my parents. This was something my Grandma had done with my Mom's brothers when they were children, so she followed in her footsteps, my Dad agreed as he used to say ""Why would things that are used to kill being merchandised for children?"" Which I sort of agree with but I also know guns are more than that. I don't have a problem with people who use guns as long as they don't harm anyone, it's their choice. My girlfriend also agrees with me in this situation.

So we had Christmas partly at my girlfriend's parents house and then went to my Mom's later in the day. My Mom bought my son a lot of presents as it's her first grandchild, but I also have very young brothers compared to me (8m and 11m). I noticed that they had been bought guns, which struck me as odd to start with since my Mom was so against them when I was a child, but I let it slide. My son opened his present and he has one of the same guns, and his uncles/my brothers wanted to play a game with them. I told him no and told him to play something else as he knows he has a no gun rule. My Mom apologised then for it and so did my Step-Dad saying he didn't know, I thought that was that.

Then, it was my son' birthday the other day and it happened again. He opened a present and opened another gun, from my Mom and Step-Dad. I got angry this time and told them we've got a no gun rule. My Mom decided since my Grandma was unfortunately no longer with us we should ""get with the times"" and I was being ridiculous. I told her if I was being ridiculous then she must have been ridiculous as I remember her berating her father (my Grandfather) for the same thing when I was a child, and give her the present back. To this I was called a ""stuck up snob"" by my Step-Dad and ""need bringing back down to my level"". We've never really got along to start with and he has always put me down, but I've always been courteous with him for my Mother's sake. 

At this point my father, my girlfriend's father, my girlfriend etc all jumped in and told them to leave as they were scaring my son (they were, he was nearly in tears) and now I've been getting threatening calls and my Mom's side of the family/Step-Dad's family abusing me on social media.

Am I right over sticking to this boundry or did I go too far?

Edit: Guns are illegal in my country if that matters.

TL;DR: I have a no toy gun policy for my child, which my Mom had for me as a child. My Mom has decided that she doesn't have that rule anymore and bought guns for him twice against my will. The 2nd time I got angry about it and got threatened by my Step-Dad and continue to get threatened, did I do the right thing sticking to my boundry?

When I was younger corporal punishment was always her way. Yelling screaming hitting etc. Moved out when I was 16ys and have had rocky friendship with her since. 
Tried to reconnect positively after my son (M2) was born. 
My mother still uses manipulation to get what she wants with everyome.  And seems to be (recently) emotionally manipulating to my partners family members to skew their thoughts about me. 


Now I'm expecting number two with my partner (M23) and we wanted a gender reveal. I was very clear I did not want a cake as other friends have done gender reveals that way and I wanted to be unique. My mother (46) and mother in law (49) agreed to work together to make a surprise. 

But tonight I found out from my MIL that my mother has been sending manipulative messages and spending false truths to get my MIL to give up her share of control over the decisions that they were meant to do together. 

My mother had apparently decided to ignore my wishes and get a gender reveal cake made. (the one thing I said not to) and my MIL was left in the dark and had no idea what my mother had planned

When I found out about the cake I was obviously upset and hurt that my mother ignored me. But it was already planned and there was nothing I could do about it. So I said that it was okay and to just continue with the planning. 

My mother then sent my MIL a message saying they ""have to change plans because (she) didn't want to be blamed for ruining the gender reveal"" and then told my MIL I was ""so upset and angry (I)  stormed out of the house like a child"" which was untrue. This made my MIL ring me immediately and apologise for making me upset. I was super confused and got my MIL to send me screenshots of their conversation. 

I really want to tell my mum she's not to be in charge of the planning anymore because 

She made my MIL feel so poorly about herself, 
She went against my only wish
She used manipulation and spread lies to my MIL

But the party is this weekend and I don't know how to tell her that I don't accept her behaviour and it's not the kind of person I want around my little new family. 

I'm not sure if I tell her after the party or before and have the chance that she sabotages the party (likely) or to wait till after and tell her??

So as a follow-up I invited my sisters over for dinner, with the exception of ""Andrea"" the one married to Scott. Once the pleasantries were over I brought up the Elephant in the room. What is going on with Scott and Andrea? I explained my side of the story, they said ""Yeah we know, we figured it was something like that..."" My response was ""What the fuck?""

Well my youngest sister explained it like this. Andrea is not very attractive, overweight, and kind of a stick in the mud. Scott is about as good as she is going to do...  

I was kind of repulsed and shocked by this thought process. It is extremely callous and I didn't realize that they had it in them as people.

They don't like Scott either but they believe he can be tolerated for the sake of Andrea. They said if it escalates to violence towards her that they would want to step in and do something, but so far he just seems like a douchebag. I brought up my interaction with him and it was essentially, ""Yeah, but you're a guy and guys fight."" They also said I like to instigate people for fun, which is true, and I should expect these types of reactions now and again. 

So I am kind of just confused... I understand their point. Andrea is not a 10 on any scale, and I could understand dating within your range, but there are tons of good guys who fit that category and aren't douchebags.

They asked if I could give Scott a chance or at least stop challenging him whenever there are family gatherings. If it becomes physical then I can feel free to intervene.

The entire situation is fucking ridiculous, my family is fucking ridiculous, and I am debating whether to stay involved for when my help is desired, or if I should abandon ship.


   
**tl;dr**: So I met with my mom and sisters and they want me to leave Scott the douchebag alone because they believe my sister can't do better than him.


Edit: So I get a lot of posts about calling the police, and this occurred in the last thread as well. But where I live is very rural so I only have the State Police and the Sheriff's Department to call if there is an issue. The State Police would take hours, and the Sheriff's department is not made up of good guys. They confiscate and ""lose"" things, they beat people up and don't arrest them, they try and escalate situations to make as many arrests as possible. They meet up at one particular bar get drunk, fight people, and then have them arrested. I am a CC permit holder, but I also smoke pot, so if the cops came by and Scott mentioned it or the cops decided to poke around or ""smelled"" something I would have been fucked. Like big time.

I hadn't even met until after the wedding. They got married while on vacation. 

So my first interactions with Scott were at Thanksgiving. I brought them a belated wedding gift and did the cursory get to know you conversation. He seemed an alright guy. He did do a few things that I thought were odd. He injected himself into the meal cooking process, like a lot he kept tasting and adding and stopping my mom and sisters from adding until she ""kicked him out"" of the kitchen. I thought he was just trying to help awkwardly. Well when we were sitting around watching football he kept talking about how they were messing up the dinner. I assured him that my mother had been making Thanksgiving dinner for over 30 years and had it down to a science. I thought we were just having a fun conversation, but the guy stewed and sulked for a good two hours. In order to not take so long I will summarize events. He insisted on saying grace, and during it insulted the food. He bogarted the conversations, like if we were talking about something he could involve himself in he would change the conversation. Didn't help clean up, complained about the meal and then tried to tell my mom how she could have improved the meal. I interjected and said, ""Mom, the meal was wonderful thanks for another wonderful meal... etc."" He in front of my mother says, ""I feel sorry for you guys, you don't know good cooking."" My mother looked him dead in the eye and said, ""I am sorry you don't know appropriate manners, next time you cook."" Meanwhile my sister was just kind of quiet during all of this, and around 7 he told her it was time for bed and she got up and went...

So you guys see what I am getting at. Straight up, the guy is an asshole. In order to keep this short I will list the run-ins I have had with him.

*I showed up to help clear brush off their property. Scott was extremely dangerous with the chainsaw and showed no skill or common sense. Kicked me off the property when I asked him not to use it. Told my sister I got tired of helping and left.

*I had them up to my house for a bonfire and caught him teasing and kicking my dog. We got into a shoving match and he told me to ""train my animal"".

*We have a family vacation planned and he insists on changing details and micromanaging it. Told us my sister and he wouldn't attend when the rest of the family said ""No"".

*My mom asked if he was making Christmas dinner since he had such a problem with Thanksgiving. He said he would, and then cancelled the morning of Christmas and dis-invited all of the family.

*Every time I have called my sister from work as opposed to my cell, he will answer and I have noticed he carries her cellphone for her.
 
Now the big one. Early January I had my car in the shop. Rather than fuck around with rides I took the day off. Midday I hear a car pull up my driveway. I check, and it is Scott. I knew the guy was up to no good so I waited to see what he was doing. He walked around the house, and started to fucking try and kick in my backdoor. I went to the back hallway and waited. The door gave and popped open and he got about 5ft into the room before I came around and asked him what the fuck he was doing. His jaw just kind of dropped. He said, ""I was just passing by and thought I saw your dog running loose, so I came by to check on him.""

We got into it and I confronted him on what an outrageous piece of shit he was, and that I did not approve of him being with my sister. I thought he was scum, and that if I ever got a hint of him putting his hands on her he would be dead. He got all puffed up at the threat and decided he wanted to tussle. We fought he lost. 

Well I told my mom as well my two other sisters. They were appalled. At the time they sided with me. I told my mom who has suffered abuse at the hands of my father that we needed to do something. I didn't know what. My mom said she would talk to her and that was that.

Well come today I am looking at FB and my family had a huge SuperBowl party that I wasn't invited to. I had even asked if they were having one and they said no.

So I called my mom and texted my sisters. The gist of the situation is that they called Scott and received his side of the story that I had invited him to the house and ambushed him. That I had used racial epithets against him and didn't like my sister dating out of her race. Which is complete bullshit. So they decided to have the SuperBowl party without me to see how he did.

So being at risk for ostracizing myself I am at a loss what to do. I would imagine I need to wait for him to burn those bridges and try and swoop in, but I also am worried about the risk of abandoning them to learn on their own.

She has made their lives a living hell due to her constant emotional abuse and harassment including shaming, bullying, emotional manipulation and extreme, hurtful comments/language/texts. This has been a cycle for years but intensified in recent months.

Brother essentially lives in his bedroom except to eat. Leaving his room means encountering her, which means instant criticism, shaming etc. He has developed serious self-confidence and anger issues and is constantly insulted, antagonized, provoked, and made to feel worthless by sister. He lashes out at her. I'm convinced that she's determined to provoke a physical altercation to feed her victim mentality and justify her grievances.

Mom lives in constant anxiety that one of them will hurt themselves/each other and has been under nonstop emotional abuse/insults by sister. Sister considers every move brother makes (usually just living his life) to be an offense. She'll then immediately text mom (serial, all-caps and profane texts) to complain and insist he be punished/disciplined, and hurl extremely savage insults attacking her for not parenting, etc. Calls her weak, pathetic, insults her intelligence, etc. She views mom not as a person, but as a tool she wishes to wield to control brother, then becomes enraged and just plain savage when the ""tool"" doesn't work as she wishes. It's now affecting mom's work performance, sleep, and emotional health. Mom is developing anxiety issues for the first time in as long as I've known her. I'm genuinely concerned she may develop a heart condition (she is overweight). She was also widowed very suddenly within the last two years and if anything could use less, not more, stress and anxiety in her life. 

I am now seriously worried for mom's and brother's mental and physical wellbeing. Stress levels are untenable in that home. 

Sister has a perpetual victim mentality and is completely unable to appreciate the true harm she is causing. She is constitutionally incapable of appreciating the experience of another person. It is always someone else's fault. Even the mere suggestion that she engage in some self-reflection is immediately viewed as an attack on her. Refuses to get professional help. She *appears* to be dealing with her own issues of depression and anxiety, although (i) truthfully I'm not sure if that's true or if it's simply more emotional manipulation to try and incur sympathy, and (ii) even if it is true, it's no excuse for the appalling things she says. For example, she'll apologize to mom, blame it on her depression/stress/problems, and then simply repeat the cycle. 

I don't believe sister should live in this house anymore as it's not healthy for any parties involved. I also believe she needs professional help, but we can't force her. And even if she did, I'm convinced she would lie to a therapist and blame everyone else for her issues. I fear this will ruin my mother's (and brother's) lives. I don't know if this type of thing is curable. Mom and brother are at wit's end and I am very concerned about all parties involved. We just don't know what to do. So, here I am.

Tl;dr at bottom. 

My entire family and I do not know how to handle the current situation caused by my aunt and her daughter. Things are going to explode soon and we want to protect my widowed grandma.

My aunt did not work for 20 years while she raised 3 kids in an unhealthy environment. Her marriage was abusive (verbally and physically, from both spouses), there was constant neighbor and ""friend"" drama, she was spending thousands of dollars each month on credit cards and not making payments, and she was a careless parent:
*she pulled my cousin's arm out of the socket several times by violently grabbing him when he was a toddler
*my other cousin had her lip bit off by a dog because she was 3 and wasn't being watched
*my aunt constantly screams and hits instead of having structure and real discipline

My aunt has a very difficult personality and constantly fights with people; my grandma said this has been true since she was a teenager. It caused her husband to HATE her and they had a very bitter and messy divorce. Every relationship in her life has been destroyed by lies, manipulation, drama, and other craziness; most of her ex-friends have said she is too dramatic, intense, and needy. For their own mental health, they had to remove her from their lives.

Her daughter (my 24F cousin) has built her life around sticking up for her mother and not abandoning her like ""everyone else does."" They are two peas in a pod and act like teenage catty drama queens with constant gossip, rumors, and lies. Since neither of them have any friends, the only people in their lives are family. This makes family their main targets for their hurtful behavior. 

Throughout her life, my aunt has attempted to commit suicide several times. She also overcame stage IIIb breast cancer 5 years ago and has other health problems. 

I have a 4 year old son. My aunt feels entitled to see him often, but he is not safe with her. There is a list of about 2-dozen reasons why my son is not safe with my aunt, to include: she has a dog that bites, she didn't buckle his seatbelt properly, she got lost on a walk in 97° heat with no sunscreen or water (3 hours, he was 6 months old), she fights with her 18 y/o son and throws things, she is clearly mentally unstable, and the latest ---she accuses my BF (31M) of abusing my son because he forced my son's coat on in the winter and my son said ""you're hurting me"" twice. The coat was on in less than 10 seconds, and my BF cradled my son and comforted him until he was no longer upset. 

My aunt then called her daughter, in hysterics, about the terrible abuse she witnessed my son suffer at the hands of my BF (she didn't call me).

I also have an ex-husband who would lose his mind if he ever thought for a second that someone was hurting our son (we split 50/50 custody and are amicable).

Grandma had my son over for a sleepover a few weekends ago, and when my aunt heard this, she said ""well YOU get to see him, huh?"" and made my grandma (her mother!) feel awkward and guilty. My son sees my aunt more than my grandma, but this won't be the case any more. 

My cousin was visiting another family member today and everything has come full circle. She accused me of being a bad parent because my son got pinkeye (not even the bacterial kind!), and she doubled-down on the abuse allegation.
I am close with the family member she visited, so she told my cousin to STFU because these are serious allegations she cannot be exaggerating; there are consequences. 



How do I remove my cousin and aunt from our lives without causing more psycho drama that will affect the whole family? Everyone is asking me to ""kick the can down the road"" because we have a wedding at the end of the year and my grandma is recently widowed. I have been kicking this can for 4 years against my instincts. 

I don't want to be anywhere near these two people and I certainly don't want my son around them. The most unstable people in his life are the two of them. 

What if my aunt hurts herself? If I keep my son from my aunt, she may do something crazy. He is ""the only joy in her life.""

I (23F) don’t know how to move forward",5.0,adbvrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/adbvrq/my_boyfriend_23m_is_emotionally_abused_by_his/,1.0,1546849707.0," Using a throwaway because my BF uses reddit. and sorry in advance for the wall of text...

My boyfriend (23M) and I (23F) have been going out for 7 years. Our relationship has always had issues because of differences in how we communication. I am very expressive and live on sharing my emotions. My bf on the other hand comes from an emotionally abusive and manipulative family that are always controlling him and putting him down. As a result, I can’t get him to express his wishes and desires to me and I don’t know what to do. When I ask him to tell me about his day or how he’s feeling I get nothing in response, he says he ‘doesn’t know how to want things’. We have talked about it countless of times but nothings changes, he says that he doesn’t believe in needing self-fulfillment or pride in his accomplishments. 

Since, he is emotionally absent from our relationship, I sometimes feel like a FWB instead of a girlfriend. Especially because we don’t live together and when we do see each other he always wants to have sex, but his despondence during other aspect of our relationship when we are apart (plus my libido killing birth control) causes me to never be in the mood. Which only serves to put him down more because he thinks I don’t want him which isn’t true at all. When we are together things are great and we are always laughing and having fun, but I know that he doesn’t feel like he can have happiness unless he is giving it to someone else. He is such a great person and has so much love to give, I just need his to realize how much he is worth.

I know all of his problems of self-worth stem from his manipulative family. They are old white southern conservative Christian racists who refuse to listen to anything that isn’t exactly what they want to hear. My boyfriend’s siblings all rebelled against his parents which caused the parents to manipulate him into staying by their side, so he could be worthy of the title ‘good son’. 

In the beginning of our relationship his parents disapproved of me because I am not white or Christian. As a result, the bf and I did not get to see each other too often, even after graduating from high school. They would always make him do busy work to keep him unable to see me. This caused a lot of strain in our relationship early on. We got to see each other a little bit more after he moved out to go to Uni, but even then, our relationship was mostly long distance as I went to a different school. His parents eventually came around to ‘liking me’ because I am successful and have a bright future ahead of me. 

My Bf feels responsible for playing therapist for his dysfunctional family and feels like he needs to solve all of their problems when he can’t even figure out what he wants or how he feels. His parents make him the messenger to communicate with his siblings, and he feels like he can’t say no. Even though he lives away from them, his parents will show up to his apartment if he doesn’t respond to them. They are suffocating even when he’s away from them. They are constantly hanging over his head that they have paid for his schooling, so he owes them. He has to work 2 jobs to make rent and be able to pay for food on top of attending school. Sometimes he has to temporarily lend his dad money because they carelessly spend on useless things that they truly can’t afford. 

He suffers from depression and has been suicidal in the past. He says he didn’t kill himself because someone would have to clean it up, he told me to my face that he didn’t even consider me.  He doesn’t believe in therapy and refuses to consider it as an option. 

I know he’s going through a rough time and has recently dropped out of school (which only caused more pestering from his parents) and started working full time. I want him to know I am there for him and that he can lean on me. There are be times that he will not respond to any of my messages for a week and I have no way of knowing if he was okay aside from texting one of his roommates. He puts it off to being busy with school or work which is understandable to a degree, but it feels bad knowing he can’t even take the time to respond to a single message. There will just be periods of time when I might as well be single. 

My BF has no self-worth and keeps all of his emotions hidden and it is weighing heavily on our relationship. I love my boyfriend, I truly do. He treats me great when we are together and his is my best friend and there was a time when I saw myself marrying him. But I don’t know what to do if he can’t get past his lack of ambition, self-worth, and emotion. What do you think I should do reddit?

This is only my second real romantic relationship, and my first one was not great, so this is all brand new territory for me.

I put them up on a pedestal and will do anything to get closer to them. 

With my current boyfriend, we met on Tinder, so I never had a “crush” phase. I’ve always liked him a lot, but I’ve never been obsessed with him. Here’s where I’m confused: Is this just a healthy way of showing love or do I not actually have genuine feelings for him?

Here’s why I’m confused: I talked to some friends and they said “Every new relationship is like ‘Wow. I didn’t know I could have feelings this strong.’” I think I had stronger feelings for my “ex,” but that also was in no way, shape, or form a healthy relationship for me.

My father is not on his death bed, but is looking slower with accumulating health problems at this point.



My childhood was certainly not as severe as other cases of abuse I read about on r/relationships, but it was something that significantly damaged my self-esteem, self-efficacy, and ability to maintain/create positive relationships. 
I have a younger sister, as well as older step-brother and step-sister (thus referred to in this post without the ""step"").



My mother entered into a relationship with my 12-years-older father not long after she had suffered a great loss at 21. There was a severe car crash that resulted in her husband dying instantly in an attempt to protect her, and the loss of her third child that she was pregnant with at the time. 
She had a high school education and two young children to care for. 
 


My mother has never been the assertive kind, terribly agreeable, and wanting to make sure everything goes smoothly even if that means deferring to a tyrant. She got together with my father and he inherited two step-children. I sincerely think that this arrangement was pragmatism on her behalf, not having the financial ability to otherwise care for her family. 



He did a bang-up job communicating with my step-siblings and ruled with an iron fist leaving no room for dissension, conversation, or feelings. The result here, and one of my earliest memories, is the police arriving at our home to take my older sister away as she had reported him for physical abuse. To my knowledge, and the reporting of my mother, there was no physical abuse. But, at the age of 14, having already tried to run away multiple times, I think she said there was physical abuse to finally be free from him. 



All communications, for as long as they lasted through the ordeal with CPS and my father, were monitored between us. My father would prompt us (my younger sister and I) to ask her questions and my mother would record it. We were interrogated if she had any interaction with us that was unsupervised for further information regarding what she was ""up to."" 
I loved her so much and feel (in my opinion) that she was scared away. If I were her age and experiencing what she did, I can't say I wouldn't do the same. 



My older brother did the same, running away from home at the age of 16 while my father pedaled the narrative that my brother had the wrong idea of ""freedom."" That is, by exchanging manual labor at a friend's house for a roof, warm meals, and friendly company, he had been confused and manipulated by his friend. 
This is a common theme, that if we disagreed with father's perspective, we had been bamboozled by someone and there was no way the thoughts we had were our own. 



Life was relatively simple if we always did what father wanted (my younger sister and I by all objective accounts were prototypical ""perfect children""). My mother encouraged my sister and I to always bow to his will, and not to say anything that would make him upset. 



We moved 6 times when I was between the ages of 6 and 12, and that made it difficult to maintain friendships alone. However, my father was an additional impediment, forcing me on many, many, many occasions to dissolve friendships that he considered to be manipulating me into doing wrong or things that weren't associated with his idea of what being a good child meant. Just being ""normal"" was also difficult because my sister and I were not well socialized, for a large portion of our lives living 1.5 hours away from where we went to school, unable to get in touch with those people we did like. He made fusses at our teachers, the most embarrassing I can recall was being pulled out of class in grade 3 because, god forbid, the teacher was reading Harry Potter and he was a wizard - in Catholic school (satan's army, y'all). 



Punishments were handed out harshly. My mother started coaching my younger sister and I to lie during incidents, beginning in grade school, in an effort to downplay the emotional reaction of my father. She said that the truth would make it worse, or in many cases, he thought that the truths were lies and we had to lie and package it as truth (i.e., he would say ""I don't think that's the whole story - there's something else there!""). He would send my mother with us to our room, and she would stress/cry at us telling us to ""come up with something!""
The interrogations typically lasted hours, which felt like an unbearable amount of time and stress for me as a child followed by stonewalling on behalf of our father. 



He was frequently angry and displaced a lot of it onto my sister and I while we tried our utmost to please him. My mother did nothing, and often requested we do additional things to make him happy. She was not spared, though, often/still being berated and corrected and insulted when she made/makes a mistake. My mother's life was, and still is, governed by what my father is doing (she makes her schedule around his), and she still refuses to say anything to him about it. 



Many times when I was a teenager I hit a threshold for bullshit and how willing I was to sacrifice pieces of myself for a man I didn't respect. My mother forced us to hug and kiss him, talk to him, and say ""I love you"" when we obviously did not. My father and I butted heads frequently because I would no longer stand for the abuse on numerous incidents, his go-to move was to dismiss my feelings (regardless of how constructively I phrased myself, often writing scripts in advance) being called ""pig-headed"" and resulting in him threatening to kick me out (three times). 
Many times I was defending my mother, who I saw as emotionally vulnerable and hapless, where I was dismissed many times without being heard. Then he would always tell me that he and my mother were ""still friends"" (that's his TM line in the ""reconciliation"" phase). 



My mother at this time cried and begged with me not to say anything to him; that he was destructive, a tyrant, and made everyone fearful; that he was not immune to repercussions for his paltry behavior. Certainly, it was not my place, but in the absence of heroes, I tried my best to step up. Multiple times she stopped me, emotionally blackmailing me saying that it would only make it worse, and often, my sister joined in. 



This turned into a bit of a venting session. I'm sorry for the excessive detail, but when I talk to others, I often hear that others have had it worse and that it didn't sound that bad. But it made my development difficult and it was always stressful; when were you going to be pulled into an interrogation about some event or accidentally say something that would result in a punishment. 
I am no longer in their home btw, happily cohabiting with my loving and supportive partner. 



The point is now, that I have resentful feelings toward my mother for allowing my father to pull my family apart (as well as her light), allowing him to continue to act in such an impertinent manner without check, and allowing her children to be abused in a similar fashion to her. 
She knows how I truly feel about him, and I think under a deep-deep-deep seated denial, she feels the same. 



Then, there are the feelings toward my father. Do I never tell him how much he negatively impacted me and that he does not get to laud his child-raising achievements because I am doing well? He was something to overcome as opposed to being a supportive person. 



Thank you for your insight and advice.

21,211,My (28f) husband's (27m) sister (18f) wants to come live with us.,81.0,es1ve1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/es1ve1/my_28f_husbands_27m_sister_18f_wants_to_come_live/,31.0,1579672881.0,"My husband (27m) and I (28f) have been together for almost 5 years. We live about 4.5 hours away from our families in another state. Recently, his sister (18f) started having some of the same issues with his family that he had.

tl;dr: My husband's sister may need to come live with us because of her home situation and he is very hesitant.

His family situation is complicated, but I will try to explain as briefly as I can. When he was in middle school his mother went to prison and his stepfather, who raised him and he calls dad, was given custody of him. His dad already had custody of the two children he had with my husband's mother. Eventually his dad remarried and all of his siblings were raised by his step-parents under the same roof - his half siblings and his dad's kids with his new wife. Things at their house were very, very strict. If chores weren't done, they made him sit out football practices and games where the team was depending on him. He had to purchase all his own grooming supplies, provide his own spending and gas money for school/work, and was not allowed to go anywhere after school under any circumstances. This is not because they didn't have the means to supply these for him, even though his stepmother has never had a job. When he was 17, his mother got out of prison and he immediately left to spend his senior year of high school with her in a town/school he didn't know just to get away. They treat the three children from his dad's first marriage extremely differently than those that belonged to the both of them. His brother left home right after graduating high school and moved in with his grandmother, which caused immense tension. They did not want her to take him in even though he had nowhere else to go (his birth mother was in a rehab facility at the time). These experiences have left deep emotional scars on my husband and he is easily overwhelmed even in positive interactions with his step parents.

Up until now his sister has been extremely sheltered. She has a huge list of daily chores, is forced to home school, is not allowed to have social media or friends outside of church, and was not allowed to get a real job. She is not allowed to have her phone in her bathroom or in her bedroom and has to leave it on the charger in the kitchen at night. If she doesn't comply they lock it in the safe to ""set healthy boundaries"". She strains against their control and has non-violent behavioral problems - probably because of her lack of autonomy and socialization. They have repeatedly tried to have her diagnosed with different disorders and at one point forced her into 72 hr psychiatric care because she told her counselor she had previously considered harming herself. She doesn't have a car, but turned 18 recently and got a job about 3 miles from their house. She bought her own phone so they could no longer take it away, but that hasn't stopped them. Apparently at one point they added themselves to her Find My Friends app so they could be alerted to her location at all times. Last week they imposed a rule that they will not drive her to work if she doesn't hand over her phone. But when she hands it over they make up other reasons why they can't take her to work, even though at least one of them is home all day. She is having to walk the 3 miles down a busy road in a large city to get to and from work. She is saving money but still can't afford a car and is almost constantly panicking about her home situation.

I am very worried about her. When they threatened to forcibly institutionalize her late last year, I wanted her to come live with us and her parents freaked out. They said that she had made up all of the issues at home because she is bipolar - even though my husband and his brother experienced the same treatment. She doesn't have any familial support there and their grandmother is unwilling to step in because of the hell she went through with their brother, and she doesn't know her birth mother at all even though she is now clean. My husband is severely hesitant for his sister to come stay with us, I think because of the emotional impact his family has on him. He is in a much healthier place mentally when he doesn't have to interact with his parents at all. he and I have a wonderful relationship and have talked about all of this to no end. He keeps saying that she can come live with us if it gets to that point, and I think that it has, but he doesn't.

She really wants to come stay with us and it's what I would do for my siblings. I have always deferred to him and will continue to do so because it is his family, but I'm worried that she will harm herself or some other terrible thing is just waiting to happen.

Should I further try to convince my husband that his sister's situation requires our assistance?

The (lack of) logic in this comment absolutely blew my mind!!! I've been thinking and trying to research about feminism in India ever since.

As expected, most mainstream coverage glorifies how much progress feminism has made in India by enacting laws to protect women. Lurking on this and the MGTOW sub has given me a rough idea of how these laws are being abused, although I'm as yet not clear about the extent of this abuse. However, my lived experience does not corroborate this. My aunt was clapping at the television in approval; the bitch emotionally abuses her husband on a daily basis yet thinks she's oppressed!!! All my guy friends (millenial) are married and controlled by their wives. My women friends got a job after college, worked till marriage or kids, then become a housewife. They'll cheat on their husbands every now and then, but cuckoldry is nothing new and can't necessarily be attributed to feminism. But my point of focus is that marriages are extraordinarily (compared to western society) stable. I'm observing with keen interest how their marriages keeps up - they constantly complain about their wives/husbands, which is normal because divorce hasn't yet been considered an option.

So what I'd like to ask you guys is: Is feminism causing a breakdown in marriages like in the west? Is this restricted to only the upper class at the moment? Does India have no-fault divorce and child support laws? What's the divorce rate like? Surely it's nowhere near 50%?

   So, it is not surprising that we are among those at the forefronts of resistance. We have been facing severe hostility towards us. One of the ways this is being carried out is by slapping sedition charges on vulnerable members of the community and curbing freedom of speech. 

  The first instance was in Mumbai pride when the pride organizers themselves sold out a member of the community,Kris (They/them) who raised some slogans to the cops. AT PRIDE OUT OF ALL PLACES!

Dad had a stroke, he should be recovering but its going to be slow. We dont know to what point of recovery he will reach etc etc. Right now basically hes a zombie in a hospital bed due to lack of better words =.

Background 2: Dad and ""step mom"" were religiously married in India, but not legally in India or in the USA.

&#x200B;

Went to a conservator-ship attorney today and my step mom insisted on coming along.  Initially when the stroke happened (5 days ago) she was telling me not to call any lawyers and in any case she doesn't want anything regardless of what happens to my dad. Today she started asking that she wants to be on the conservator-ship. Luckily the attorney recommended since the marriage is not legal I be the sole conservator (temporary 3 month)- this is great. Then my step mom asked if there is any way for her to legalize this marriage while my father is not cognizant. Our attorney did not know, and suggested she look into it.

&#x200B;

I am starting to get spine chills here. I dont like the way this is going. Especially because with discussions with her (my dad has been an abusive person), she is still deciding what she wants to do in the outcome of this stroke. Leaving him has been mentioned. She has mentioned, see his status and then potentially leave him (is he back to normal, is he close to normal, is he mentally incapacitated, is he a vegetable).

&#x200B;

Additional fact: Right now. I was told the lion's share will be going to me because I am listed as the beneficiary on his accounts. She did mention the house which is worth quite a bit would be split if the marriage is legal

&#x200B;

I know so far I am only looking into conservatorship which is primarily maintaining dads finances, but her money hungriness + her discussion of potentially leaving + her asking if she can legalize the marriage without him, leaves me to this major question:

**Can my ""Step mom"" legally marry my dad while he is ""unconscious/incapacitated""?**

&#x200B;

I dont want her to some how get ""in"", get control of a major set of the assets, and then jump back out.

[Confused rant]",219.0,f2t5vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/f2t5vv/im_sorry_but_transphobia_and_homophobia_are_in_no/,34.0,1581551393.0,"Homophobia is always unjustified. Part of the reason for that is that some people being gay _in no way_ impacts on someone else's life, kind of like your neighbour being left-handed ain't going to hurt you, and your neighbour has every right to be left-handed and not to be forced to write with his right hand instead. I'm not minimising their struggles, but in the above sense, in a sane world,  homosexuality itself would be a non-issue. It has only needed to become a movement because of homophobia and intolerance, due to which homosexual and bisexual people have had to fight for their rights. Most people are straight, but some are gay, and some bisexual. That's normal human society. 

""Transphobia"", however, especially as things currently stand, has reasons. There are reasons for people being ""transphobic"", which _actually_ justify discriminating against transgendered people. Basically, anyone would be ""transphobic"" once they knew enough about transgenderism and TRAs. The fetishes, the violence, the hate and misogyny. HOW do these people actually think that I should believe self-admitted men who dress as little girls and parade their pedophilic fetishes in public and on the Internet are in any way safe? I'm transphobic, I've got good reason to be. How is that comparable to gay people living their lives like all other normal people? How have these people come to attach themselves to and identify themselves with the struggles of being gay in an intolerant world? Of course I'm going to be suspicious of an obvious male who wears dresses and insists he's a woman and tries to convince me at any cost that he is. I don't think transgender people should be fired from jobs or denied housing or arrested for dressing as they please. Personally, all of this ""feminine"" clothing is just dumb, expensive and inconvenient, dressing ""like men"" makes the best sense to me. A pair of pants or jeans, a shirt, comfortable clothing that's clean, honestly that's what matters to me. I don't mind them dressing how they want, but I reserve my right to be distrustful. But why am I being forced to believe that transwomen are exactly the same as me? They are not. I know about pedophilia, I know about autogynephilia. Trans people have already told us a lot about themselves. I'd avoid all transwomen if I could, and I wouldn't want any daughters of mine to be near them. That's ""transphobia"", but I honestly don't see why it's wrong when female safety is at stake. I don't hate them or anything, people shouldn't be discriminated against for clothing choices, but clothes should be practical and socially acceptable. I'm not sure if a man wearing a pink frock like a seven-year old child and lipstick could necessarily be seen as socially acceptable. That's really their fault. It says something about them that's potentially very, very problematic. There are various social norms and ideas about looking silly. But ok. What makes this demographic dress so impractically just to ""be themselves""? Why aren't actual women and gay people dressing impractically to ""be themselves"" and calling so much attention to themselves? But a gay person dating, or married to a person of the same sex is really not at all inherently different from straight people being in heterosexual relationships. These things, trans people and gay people, really aren't the same. 

Then they say that that's like racial discrimination against black and brown women. How so? I mean, I've come across various racist claims against especially black women, jokes etc. on the Internet, and apparently many white women in the US many decades ago claimed that black women (and perhaps WoC as well) were ""dangerous"" or dirty in some way and should not associate with them. But if they had actually observed facts, they would have found that those are just false claims, because black women are just, well, regular women, and these people were just racist. They're no different. I'm brown, and I'm no different than someone who's black or white. Black women and WoC won't harass white women, or attempt to assault them simply by being let into the same bathrooms or spaces as them. 

But that's not what you see when you agree with the Transwomen and let them into women's toilets. Like I said, I know about the fetishises, and how they've filmed women, assaulted us, creeped on us. How could I believe that I would be safe? How would young girls be safe with them in there? Unlike between white women, and all other women, there's a more than skin-deep, material difference! I mean, they're just really male! 

I belong to a very Conservative South-Indian community, and homophobia is rampant here, and gay people cannot live their lives, even though them being gay is nobody else's business. Anyone who is kind and has seen enough will pretty soon realise that all this outcry in India against homosexuality is completely baseless, because homosexual people are only trying to live their lives like normal people and not be forced into unwanted heterosexual relationships. They are seeking their rights to do so, and aren't trying to take anything away from anyone else. They are regular people. I don't think that's the same as what these transwomen in Western countries want.",2020.0,2.0,13.0,05:34:53,

No, Chase. The fact that cultures have different views of gender actually supports MY argument that gender is culturally constructed. Every culture, all over the planet, believes that there are two sexes. There is no variation. It's simply material fact. What they disagree on, is what to do with people who don't conform to their society's gender roles. How do they address homosexuals? In Georgian England, you might get dandies and macaronis. (These were men, and viewed as men). In Lakota tradition, you might get two-spirits. Intersex people may be viewed as mystical beings, but hijra are not considered actual women, and most of them are not even intersex. 

Every time you claim that other cultures have multiple genders, you're skipping the part about the wide variations of belief. The reason for such variety is because these rules and norms are socially constructed, not innate.

I'm Indian. LGBT related things are really not that great here. But at least the rights law has passed in 2018.

I don't know her irl. Only through discord. A girl. Lets call her Ruhi. 
She was barely 22. I got to know her through a lgbtq server. We often used to chat. She has a  crazy strict family. And male favoured family. Her mother had two abortions when she was 3 years old because the two foetuses were female. 
Even though test for knowing the gender of an unborn child is illegal in india. It still happens.

She is a lesbian. And her whole family considers lgbt to be some sort of disease and all. Therefore she's been inside the closet forever.
When she was nine years old, her grandmother literally said on her face ,""what are you dreaming about going to college and becoming a doctor? You're a girl. Your greatest dream should be and has to be getting married to a family we choose. Only your brother can be a doctor. He's a boy"" (I don't remember the exact lines she told me but was something like this)

She was beaten up by her dad with a belt because one day she wore shorts to a local store. Her mother and everyone has always preferred her brother on every issue. 

Now , the main part.
Her female friend, who also happens to be queer was over at her place and due to a heat of moment they made out with each other. Now guess what, evil little brother saw this and told the entire family. She explained me that, the way her father beat her up felt like getting ""skinned alive."" 
They then temporarily took away all her ways of communication. Took her phone away. Her laptop which she brought with her own money. Locked her inside the house. They didn't even let her go to the office where she worked. Just locked her up.
And then they were forcing her into an arranged marriage. And she had no where to run away because they have completely restrained her.
This was what I heard from her one and a half year ago.

A little time after her incident i left that account of discord due to some personal reasons and opened another account. I completely forgot about her. I mean she lived literally on the other end of the country so what could i have done. And everything she said could have been a complete lie or made up shit.

But recently after i logged into the previous account. I found her again. Online. (Kinda like finding your old online game buddies after 5 years) i reread the chats to remember everything properly. I asked her her condition. 

According to her , she did get married to a guy. The guy's family was fucked up too. But the guy himself was of the youth generation. Thus tolerant and accepting. She was very honest to him and explained him everything. He agreed to help her. He didn't deserve to be in a loveless marriage either. They soon moved out of his parents house and temporarily rented an apartment. She got back into her job with several of apology letters and her employer who knew her condition and problems completely welcomed her back with a few conditions. Unbestowed to the two families they we also getting their divorce papers ready. I don't know much details here. But after they got divorced her father tried to force her back together with him. But she was done. She managed to earn enough for herself. Lived alone. Cut off all ties with the crazy family. They called her because they didn't know her address almost 30-35 times a day thus she changed her number. 
They even reached her work place to force her out , rather they just got banned from there.

She's sad that the relationship between her family is now broken but she's finally free.
That's all i know


★This is india. You just can't runaway from home like America and other first world countries. Part time jobs won't pay you shit to live and cover college tuition. The College fee is too high in ratio with the earnings. And the whole society would kind of boycott you if you runaway and you're a female. Staying at an unknown place is really risky because you can literally get raped any moment.
