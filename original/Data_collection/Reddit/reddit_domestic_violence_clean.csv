5,Parental Abuse: What to do?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ggfu6u/parental_abuse_what_to_do/,"I am writing this with such a heavy heart. But anyway, here it goes.

So, I a\[m\] 20 and my girl\[f\]riend is current almost 18. We have been in a relationship for over two years now. Her family is affluent, meaning her dad is a lawyer and she lives in a small town so it's a big deal and her uncle is settled in UK, you know, the usual. However, her family is extremely political. No one, does anything without thinking of the familial political outcome of it. Well, my girlfriend, lets call her Remy, developed BPD (clinical) from years of childhood trauma seeing her alcoholic dad fight with her mom. Her mom is the type who does everything for social validation. Remy wants to study Bsc but her mum wants has to do Btech just because her nephew is doing the same and Bsc is not considered to be a socially valid thing to do. The reason I am having to seek you lovely people's advice is because of what has been happening over the week mainly because her mum is home 24/7 now.

It all started with remy talking to her best friend (male) over phone. Lot of shit went down, including humiliating character assassination. Now remember she is someone who is going through BPD and has ran out of antideps and is neither being able to visit her doc. And just today she couldn't hold it in anymore and just burst out in front of her mum. Calling her out for not giving her a fair childhood and that sort of things.

I asked her to calm down and keep her head low till she's at least earning on her own, she listened to me and shut up.

So she teaches her baby brother in the evening, he's in upper kindergarten right now and her mum dragged this little child by his hair out of her room, that was truly traumatising.

This has been going on for so long. What options do I have to put an end to all of this? Please suggest.

\[**UPDATE: 9-05-2020\]**

**In a weird turn of events, her mom apologised and said she lost her cool that's why she did all she did. I didn't accept it as I cannot see my girlfriend being treated like that.**

Also, some of you have asked me to post the name of her med here if anyone can help

6,Police officer verbally abused me when dropping my sister at her workplace who is a bank officer and is compelled to work in this corona curfew,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gc2ukh/police_officer_verbally_abused_me_when_dropping/,"Here is the background of the incident. 

Corona virus has started spreading like wildfire in Chennai. But as you may all aware Banks are almost fully functional as per government directive. But what most of you may not be aware is that the Banks have not arranged any kind of transport assistance to it's employees. So, it has fallen upon me to pickup and drop off  my sister, who is an officer at a PSB, from and to the bank which is situated 8 KMs away from our residence.

This frequent commutation has been a nightmarish experience from day-1. On the way, we are usually stopped by police at one or two check points. Bank has provided me with a permission letter with my vehicle details. But Police have never been friendly or patient. Every single experience with the police have been very harsh. They always speak in a very arrogant and disrespectful manner. It is hard to explain them my reason for traveling, especially when driving without my sister on the way back home in the morning or on the way to bank in the evening.

Today morning, we were stopped on the way to bank, my sister displayed her ID Card to the police. The police person in white uniform said something, I couldn't hear him properly. I was wearing a mask within my helmet. He was also wearing a mask. So, I moved my bike a bit to get a little bit closer to him so that I can hear him. He immediately started shouting - ""Mutta Payale, Mutta Payale, angaye niruthuda"". It could be translated as, ""Dumb F###er, stop right there, idiot!"".

It made me so furious. But I knew I can't say anything. We explained politely that we are going to bank. He then checked my driving licence. I know if I questioned why he is being impolite, I will end up having my bike confiscated for some innovative reason. After ensuring everything was okay, he let us go and movee away from us. When I was about to start the bike, another police person in Khaki stopped and inquired us again. I had to explain the story again before he let us move.

This is not an isolated incident. Similar incidents are occuring repeatedly. Two things about this makes me outrageous.

1.) Why aren't the Banks not arranging safe commutation for its employees, especially for women employees ? Am I getting paid to go through such an ordeal every single time ? 

2.) How can police be so arrogant without any impunity ? I just can't stand this fact. Why do they have to showcase their power every single time ? Yes, I agree. We are all slaves ane have to bear silently all the harrasment done by the police. But I still can't digest the reality that Police can say or do whatever they want, and we can't do anything about that. He abused me. He didn't even say sorry. He didn't hesitate for a moment to abuse me. He didn't even feel the need to apologise. And you know what, yet I couldn't say a single word. Not a single word. If I had asked him to apologise, it would have only made the situation more worse. 

And my worst fear is that some people might tell me that ""It's no big deal"". That is, police harrasments are taken for granted. That is what making me more outrageous. This is the kind of atmosphere that allows the police abuse to flourish. This is not fair.

The person later told me of an abusive past in which he/she recieved constant abuses, beating and threats from the his/her father.

I am not a psychologist but I know countless such stories and the fact that a psychologist I know was always curious about the past and childhood of his/her patients.

I think most of the stress/anxiety disorders in India are just manifestations of ""Please give me freedom"" screams of the person that he/she expressed in his/her childhood days but no one came to his/her rescue.

Take this as an Armchair advice, but if you want to solve your disorder, then tell to your self everytime that ""I am a smooth and free bird"". This may start the virtuous cycle.

Hi All, 

Sharing the story beforehand:

I am the younger son of 2 siblings to a wonderful set of parents who are in the super-senior citizen category (75 & 70 Year Old). 

My elder brother (aged 34) who is married has continuously harassed, abused and beat my parents whenever there's an argument that turns into a heated argument. His wife has never supported nor condoned his acts. I have a 2 years old video proof of him pushing my father.

Could someone suggest what legal options i have to ensure this stops? Also, as it goes with Indian parents and 'respect', my parents have strictly said no to any involvement of outside party. 

All our relatives at some point or the other have tried to talk sense into this elder brother, however it is only temporary. 

&#x200B;

I know whatever i have written might be like a haphazardly jotted down note, but my current state of mind doesn't give me the luxury to write much about whatever is happening with my parents.

Hi reddit.

For context, I am 20F and my cousin is 28M now. I was 15/16 when this happened and he was 24. I live in the states, but my family is really indian (culturally) so I thought I would get the best opinion here. 

I've made a post about my sexual abuse story: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dlq0s1/was_i_molested_by_my_cousin_i_dont_know_if_i_am/). I would suggest at least skimming over it but it is not necessary. Long story short, when I was 16, my cousin snuck in the room several times at times and touched me inappropriately (boobs (fondling and pinching my nipples) and my hip (I think he tried to touch my ""area"" but  I started getting more aggressive and he stopped, but he might have when I was sleeping). For those of you asking why I didn't stop him after the first time, I was scared of not being believed but I did tell him to stop several times and he wouldn't. Anyway. Recently I have been doing a lot of emotionally processing and healing, and this trauma is at the root of most of my mental health issues. I was extremely angry and resentful towards him for 4 years (rightfully so) but it took a huge toll on my mental health and didn't allow me to heal from this. I'm conflicted because he is not a ""bad"" person. Yes, he did a monstrous thing but he is not a monster and that is making this so confusing and even more difficult. Our family is very close so I've been around him A LOT these past few years, and we've had a lot of great moments together and I *almost* forgot what happened for a split second every time. I want to forgive him, especially for myself, but I don't know how to do that. Personally, I know that I need to have a conversation with him about this but I don't know how to bring this up. I don't even know if he remembers or if he will admit to it, but I think I'm prepared for both of those outcomes. My question is, is he worthy of forgiveness? I know it's a healing process for me, but does he deserve to know that I have forgiven him? Also, how would you go about this situation? Any and all advice is appreciated!

I have been a member of this community for so long and I love this community for its progressive thoughts. I wanted to get something off my chest and also ask you folks' opinion.

I have held this off inside me for too long but today want to put it out. My father is a narcissist and manipulative person. He hasn't worked in his entire life and has only done few menial jobs for very less time. My mother has struggled hard to raise me by securing a government job with her father's and brother's efforts.

However, father has been abusive and manipulative to her and she has put up with it because of Indian society, chaar log kya kahenge bla bla. I hadn't recognised this before or tried to ignore it thinking it will be ok later and also I stay away from them since I work in a faraway city and visit them once in a while.  This time due to corona effect I had to travel since I stay alone and can't cook for shit.

Today morning again he started with his bullshit about some silly reason to her and I couldn't hold any longer and got into an argument with him to defend her. The shouting match prevailed and neighbour could hear us. After this, I realized that this is not good so I sat and tried to reason with him for almost three hours and also apologised for shouting at him. But he got only defensive and never discussed his actual feeling out but instead started blaming me and my mother about everything. It's strange that he doesn't even recognize that it is her and to some extent my hard work that is putting the food on the table.

I don't know how I will continue for remaining 15-16 days like this and how to help my mother also. Any thoughts and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

I am wondering there must be some options instead of asking such kid to complete school, college and then wait for his first salary so he can move out.

Something like a NGO or working as an Ethical Child labour in some Tea Shop? Atleast would be better than living with a toxic family for years untill school or college ends right?

It's natural for the movement to have some criticism and strong resistance indeed. But problem arises when the extremists are hijacking the movement to promote their personal agenda like with every other movement. Social media is fuelling the rise of extremists everywhere, from politics to religion to individual movements. Extremists appeal the masses, their fiery content spreads faster than coronavirus on the social media platform. 

I am a Man and a Feminist, I believe in equality. I have worked with organisations against domestic abuse of women, I even refain from using the Nazi word to refer to the extreme feminists. But the recent #boislockerroom controversy saw posts of such extreme feminists with their generalized derogatory view about a particular gender and populist rhetoric like ""Oppressors don't deserve equality"", ""Equality for oppressors is a form of oppression"" mixed with their own personal biases and agenda. 

Now don't get me wrong here, I am not shooting down claims of these people, I absolutely have no idea what they have been though. But it's merely my observation how social media is spreading views of such extremists. Such posts tends to attract more people, it tends to create divide amongst others (When my female friends shared posts like ""Even you are responsible because you benefit from the system and you don't prevent others from enforcing it""), It helps to propagate exactly the same thing they are fighting against, Patriarchy.

42,Advice and a Word of Caution for Indians thinking About the Student Route to Immigrate to Canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gkam3g/advice_and_a_word_of_caution_for_indians_thinking/,"I recently saw a popular post on immigration strategies that listed Canada as the easiest country to migrate too. I want to provide some more context to this ""very easy"" strategy. My goal is not to discourage anyone from immigrating but to provide awareness of the challenges most commonly faced by Indians that the student route to obtaining permanent residency status in Canada.

**Context**

College and university in Canada are two very different things. Colleges offer diplomas, certificates, and maybe some 3 year degrees. Universities offer 4 years degrees (BA, BSc. etc.) and Masters/PhD/Medical/Law etc. programs. In Canada colleges are popular with people already in the workforce, university graduates looking for specific skill certifications, and people looking to enter non-office jobs. Until recently most international students in Canada enrolled in universities not colleges. But recent changes have opened up a new route of enrolling is college diploma programs where upon graduation they hope to fulfill the requirement of 1 year work in Canada (any field) after which they can apply for permanent residency.

This has led to a huge increase in international students from India. Up until the early 2010s India, China, and Philippines all sent around ~30,000 immigrants to Canada a year. Now China and the Philippines remain at ~30,000 while India has shot up to ~85,000. This boom has had implications potential Indian students should be aware of which I will now discuss.

**The Trap Some Indian Students Enter**

Canada is a great country, no doubt. But when it comes to living here there are some challenges. Those challenges are...

1. Limited Job Market: it's a small country, very spread out
2. Competitive Job Market: huge number of recent immigrants + a decline in some sectors like oil means competition for any type of job even low-pay ones can be surprisingly strong
3. Expensive housing: Cities like Toronto and Vancouver are extremely expensive, small towns and cities are cheaper, but the job market is worse. Also the influx in students mean many areas surrounding colleges are now expensive due to high demand. 
4. The lack of recognition for Indian education or experience: Unfortunately Indian education is not respected here, and I've seen Indians with Masters degrees and job experience have to enroll in bachelor programs all over again. Only exception is if you've experience with a multi-national company, one that the typical Canadian will have heard of. The doctor driving a taxi stereotype is not a joke, it's extremely common.

Unfortunately many students do not fully understand the situation they are entering. So they enter the following trap.

1. Your family takes on expensive loans or sells property to send you to Canada to do your education
2. You enroll in a diploma course from a small college somewhere that has limited value and recognition
3. You graduate and enter Canada's very competitive job market and find white collar jobs are next to impossible to land, and you must settle for blue collar ones (trucking, factory, fast food, drivers and delivery men, women may also do maid/elder care jobs). An article on Canadian factories that hire only immigrants and how they're treated. https://projects.thestar.com/temp-employment-agencies/ 
4. Because your parents spent so much money to send you here you cannot just come back, but you find yourself stuck at the bottom of the ladder. Living costs are high and there may be an expectation to send money home so saving money is a challenge too.

Now of course every student comes thinking they will make it, and they will work as hard as it takes. Which is great, but most of the students trapped in what I just described thought that way too. You may also say low wage work in Canada is still better than India. Possibly, but it's definitely not an easy life when you spend every day working at multiple low wage jobs just to make ends meet. I've heard some say if they worked this intensely in India they could've probably ended up somewhere better. 

For Canadian colleges these students pay much higher tuition than domestic students so they bring in a lot of additional revenue for the country, further more Canada has fewer young people and university is becoming more popular than college. Many colleges have no been recruiting Indian students just for the higher tuition they pay, so they can survive and avoid declining enrollment.

**Backlash**

Furthermore the enormous sudden influx of Indian students has created some backlash. In small towns these students can overwhelm the local job market competing with the local working class population, and making the limited job pool even more competitive. 

In cities the students usually settle in older Indian neighborhoods home to pre-2010 immigrants and Canadian born Indians (who are called Indian-Canadians). Here too job competition increases and the result is the older Indian community has also become hostile against Indian students. Several articles in Canadian and Indian media have described the tension between Indian-Canadians and Indian students. This often combines with accusations of crime and deviancy. Here is one article: https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/douglas-todd-indo-canadians-in-uproar-over-surge-of-foreign-students/

The good news is even with this Canada is extremely friendly to Indians and things like violence against immigrants is ultra-rare.

**COVID-19**

COVID-19 has resulted in millions of jobs lost, the worst Canada has seen in 100 years. If the job market was competitive before it will be ultra-competitive for the future and international students will find themselves at the bottom of the hiring process. Here's an article: https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2020/05/08/they-hoped-for-jobs-and-to-immigrate-to-canada-for-international-students-the-pandemic-has-dimmed-that-hope.html

This situation will take at minimum 5 years to rectify, especially when you consider how many businesses have shut down permanently and how many Canadians who have never been unemployed before are now desperately looking for work.

**Advice for Potential Students**

1. **Consider a graduate program from a University**: The college route is the fastest and simplest but also leaves you with the least valuable certification. In a country where even domestic MBAs spend 2-3 years looking for a good position a business diploma from a small college no one has heard of will not impress anybody. Maybe your fine doing blue collar jobs instead of an office job, okay but remember COVID-19 created 2.5 million unemployed Canadians who you will now compete with in addition to thousands of fellow students. Doing a degree in India, from a reputed school, and then doing a Masters in Canada is the best route for securing good employment. It might take a few years but it's a better chance of success. In Canada job experience is highly valued so select Masters programs that include mandatory internships or co-op place mats. It will give you the Canadian experience that can be so hard to get for immigrants. PS. Cheating is hard in Canada, and professors have little sympathy for sob stories about how you need to pass because you can't go back to India empty handed. As more cases come to light schools are cracking down, and the press is harming the reputation of hard working students. https://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/news-story/9615483-they-passed-the-admissions-test-but-they-were-failing-in-class-how-niagara-college-tackled-an-international-student-crisis/

2. **Maybe hold off on Coming Here till a few Years After COVID-19**: The job market in India has been hit by COVID-19 sparking interest in going abroad, but recognize the job market in Canada is pretty awful right now too. No sense in dropping huge sums to end up in a foreign country unemployed, or just barely scrapping by on a low wage job with no security.

3. **Job Prep from Day 1**: Look out for any opportunities for internships, job training, certificates programs from day 1. Don't think of this as something to worry about after graduation. In many cases this can be the difference between success and failure. I've seen several Indian student spend their student years not especially focused and then spend 3 years after graduation working 14 hours a day working 3 different retail jobs.

4. **Network Outside the Indian Student Community**: The broader your network the more unique opportunities pop up. It can be a challenged, cultural barriers exist and it can be much easier to settle in a friend circle of fellow Indian students. There's also the challenge that some Canadians and Indian-Canadians look down on immigrants. But if you make an effort you will find new friends.

5. **Avoid Crime**: Goes without saying, but increasingly a few students have entered illegal sectors like drug trade our of desperation or frustration. Sooner or later this will end very badly for you, and increasingly incidents like this have resulted in some landlords refusing to rent to male Indians students in some small towns on the USA/Canada border. One example, some Indian students got into a drunk public fight over a petty issue. Someone recorded it and it went viral, police identified them and they were deported. Imagine your parents selling their land to send you to Canada and you got sent back because you got in a fight over something useless. Furthermore, such incidents have drawn negative attention to Indians and Indian neighborhoods. This may come as a surprise to many Indians who often believe their own hype and think the whole world thinks of Indians as a much of super smart hard workers. See this story on how Canada's largest Indian majority region now deals with the reputation of being a ghetto. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/brampton-a-story-of-political-importance-power-and-ethnic-enclaves/article30273820/

6. **Don't Trust Someone Just Because They're Your Community**: When you're in a foreign country it can be exciting and comforting to meet people from your state, district, caste, religion etc. But many times Indian students find themselves being cheated or abused by employers who come from their very community. So exercise caution, learn your rights, and don't put blind faith in an employer or new friend just because you've similar backgrounds. Thanks u/lovefun8in for bringing this up.

Of course this is not to say every Indian in Canada fails. There is a huge middle class community Indian community in Canada and Indian professionals are found in every field.

50,My Experience at Byjus,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gdxttt/my_experience_at_byjus/,"It is so good to see that finally people are speaking out about the horrible culture and practices that take place inside the company that's currently valued at $10 Billion.

I'll start by saying that I worked at the company for not more than 3 month, I had prior experience (which in the hindsight really helped me)

So when I joined, Byju was in process of mass hiring, the entire ""interview"" was a joke, just a couple of questions that they picked up online. After accepting we were called to their Bangalore Headquarters for training for a week, (Flight and Accommodation at Oyo which was paid for by the company btw). 
The ""training"" is basically where they painted a rosy picture and told us how we are not supposed to call ourselves salesmen but from now onward, we are **education counselors**.

During that period I could gather that, most of the people were freshers who came from towns and villages looking at the pay package or those from cities with poor acads, so major co's weren't hiring them because of that. I have nothing against that, but the managers know that people might be desperate enough to stick around and they made use of that knowledge.

A total of 12+ people including myself were transferred to our base city. There, we actually got to know the real picture regarding the work. That is where we were told what kind of hell we were entering into

1.  Wednesday to Friday was office time and 1 client meeting after that.
1.  Saturday and Sunday was only client meets entire day, atleast 3-4 client meets per day.


* We were supposed to call potential leads/customers during the day, say from 10am to 6pm ( Wed, Th, Fri )

* After 6 pm, we were supposed to have client meeting every single day, which would run upto atleast 9 pm, but it could go upto 11-12 am if you complete the sale, and another hour to travel home. This was basically the same schedule everyday.

* During the weekend, if you are not able to set up a client meet, or if you dont make a sale, you are supposed to come back to the office, first the manager will have a shoutfest with you in front of other managers and then you are forced to keep calling clients until the manager says its ok to leave. 

* You are supposed to get Monday **AND** Tuesday off, but even during those days, you are forced to work from home, asked to call clients from your private number, which eventually gets registered as spam. 

* Even when the company was supposed to have a holiday, they would ask us to come and work. The Bangalore HO would always get that holiday as day off day, but the sales offices were treated like step children, we could see it in our calendar but they would still ask us to come to work.

**We haven't even talked about the managers yet.**

The requirement to become a manager? As a salesman get your total sales up to 1 cr or 1.2cr or near by and you are eligible to be a manager, breeze past the interview and boom you are now a manager.
No real management training, nothing is taught. how do you expect them to not turn out like what you have seen on twitter.
After *Managers* there are *Senior Managers*, after that couple more arbitrary titles then comes the *AVP*. Which is basically all riding on the sales numbers that your team provides. that's the only requirement to climb up.

**A good salesman doesnt necessarily make a good manager**

The job of the manager/snr manager/avp is to keep shouting on those below so that they somehow make the sale. 

During my tenure, there was not a single HR person posted in my office, which is shady in itself.

* They give you a script to follow during your calls as well as during you sales meetings, you are supposed to pretend to be someone you are not (education counselor) so that the parents trust you. They even give you a card with that printed on it to look more legit. Most of the guys around, would need an actual education counselor themselves, if they were any real questions.

* If you are lucky enough to close the sale, the financial side is even worse. they use financial services that provide loans to parent which are basically loan sharks.

* Byju has 15 days return policy, after which you can not return your products, most salespeople do not mention it, as long as the sale gets reported in that weeks stats they are fine with it, even if its eventually returned, it doesnt matter.


This all is tolerated because the pay that you can earn is almost equivalent to what you get at a bschool. I have seen people, in a **single month**, picking up **1 - 1.5L in just sales commission**, thats on top of the salary (which i believe they have now reduced)

And these managers know money is why people stick around and its why they lord it over their heads, every single response is **""Company paisa de rahi hai na, chup chaap kaam karo""**

They take the top salespeople to various trips, if you complete a certain target amount of sales during stipulated time. This is the worst time to be a employee. the pressure is immense, and your manager's trip depends on your stats as well, double that, then your snr manager so triple that, then avp so quadruple that.

They are all lovely, kind and nice people IRL but POV of even the nicest people in our country is so warped, it isn't surprising how we continue to suffer.

Needed to get it off my chest and vent so here goes:

1. It's the poor people that are enjoying the lockdown the most. Because they are getting free food from govt and salaries from the homes they work in.


2. Removing labour laws is necessary because 80% of labourers abuse those laws and because of that company suffers. It is the managers that are exploited the most, not labourers.


3. If someone is poor and living in slums, it is their fault. As they can rise above and improve their lives if they just 'work hard'.


4. India has lower cases of coronavirus because we have strong immunity.


5. Most of the death reported from coronavirus are actually death from other causes, who just happened to get the virus.


And last but not the least. 


6.  Virus will be gone within 2-3 months. It is not a big deal. More people in India die from TB. Why no one talks about that.

I have a family member who is so fucking passive aggressive it has drove me crazy over the years without even realising what is happening because i wasnt able to put my finger on this word ""passive aggressive"". I finally realised how he is passive aggressive to a extent he will ruin anything for you before you even begin it if it means he wont be able to enjoy it or it will lead to him having less control on you. 

I live in his house so I do not have the option of leaving, but YEARS AND YEARS of this abuse while putting a lovely front has left me with TONS of issues. 

I have been slapped between marriage halls, slapped  or punched at relatives places for getting food on my clothes, slapped and threw my phone away because he ""caught"" me talking to friend late at night. 

I have no privacy. I wrote down a few feelings in a diary and went to pee and came back to him and his spouse waiting for me with the page of the diary open. 
I have had shoes thrown at me, hit with belts till they broke and what not. 

I swear this is not the worst part, the amount of PRESSURE i have towards my future made me want to do something to myself several times for a few moments of peace before I go gentle into that good night. 

There have been times when i felt like the best way to make them hurt was to do something to myself and I smiled for I knew how much grief and pain it would cause them. Trust me I am not being selfish. I have endured 1000times more bullshit and abuse then i have let on here. Its usually always emotional now because I am not longer a small boy who would easily succumb. 

I have sneaked into his phone and found so many incriminating shit that I could destroy his marriage. 
But a few days ago something happened and I finally saw everything for what it was and promised myself that I will get the DUCK out of here as soon as I can. 
I am studying for 3 very well respected and professional degrees and the moment i get a chance i will fuck off.

She said she was caught up with another case and asked my neighbour to wait 2 more days. She told my neighbour to call her anytime if there's any trouble or if she needs any medical aid. So far this is the only response we got from all the attempts, it's better than nothing. Will update later on. Sorry if the formatting is bad.

UPDATE 1: Received a response from NCW, they talked to the girl and patched her call to some local representative. A lady cop will visit tomorrow, she also assured that the girl will not be evicted forcefully and they will provide medical support to her and the baby as well as look for shelter. Let's see how it goes. I'll update here if there's any significant resolution and keep try other avenues just to be sure. Thank you all for your response. I really appreciate it.


Tl;dr at the bottom, but I request you to read the whole thing.

Hey everyone, this is a situation regarding my neighbour. She is 24 years old, has a 7 month old baby and she is also 4 months pregnant. She is not very intelligent and blindly trusts anyone. She met a guy 4 years ago through sms, classic fraud love story, and left everyone to be with him. She saw the guy for the first time when she arrived at the station. He was a 50 something dude, she regretted for a bit but had no choice and stayed with him, she feared returning would be fatal.

They married in a temple, the guy tore the documents, anything which would show their marriage as legitimate. She didn't stop, because she trusted him. He was usual abusive, he beat her and emotionally played her every time. Sometimes later she discovered that he has 2 other wives as well. So this guy would jump between wives, abuse them, leave them, stay with another and go back when he felt like it.

He moved this girl to a new place, adjacent to my apartment, we saw him beat her once, obviously intervened. Few days later the guy disappears. This girl thought he was kidnapped by his ex wife who allegedly threatened him to do so. The guy is also a lowly criminal, steals and sells the stolen stuff (yeah I live in a dump actually). Anyway later our suspicions were right, he dumped her.

He didn't leave her any money, when she called the society for help, they actually turner against her and wanted to evict her, they are waiting for the end of lockdown to do that. She tried police, they asked for money and threatened to arrest her instead, called her really inappropriate things. NCW also denied help, we tried local foundation and ngo, no one is willing to help and blaming her.

We even asked the girl to try and put the baby for adoption, she doesn't agree, can't blame her for that. But the baby drinks packaged milk, which we are providing right now. We have tried everything, I am broke as well or I would have helped her financially for sometime, but I quit my job at a very bad time.

So basically she is proper f**d if I put it bluntly, given time she can get back on her feet, but I'm more concerned about the baby, as she is very distraught, doesn't eat for few days, we actually force her. There's only so much anyone can bear before snapping. I am concerned that she might take her life if things don't work out.

When she pleaded with the guy for help you know what he said, ""that's your matter"". I've never wanted to hurt someone so bad before. So now we might have 5 days left before the lockdown ends, and people here will evict her for sure, forgot to mention that her rent is due as well. Is there anyway to help her get some shelter or some work? I've called so many places and they all turned out to be useless, if the police won't help, who would? And to be honest I've completely lost faith in humanity.

My father is the longest tenured and senior-most economics professor in my state. He isnt very liked because of his shitty attitude [and he is abusive and tried to kill me and mom, said it various times here in my previous 2 accounts] but his craft is well respected by his peers.

When he for his MA Economics from Kalyani University with GOLD medal in 1981, he was also an upcoming CPM youth leader groomed to be a future party head. He was fairly connected and got an opportunity at a scholarship from Harvard University for his PHD.

All he had to do was somehow get rs 50000 in 80's rupees and go to the Interview where he was probably gonna get accepted. He was that good. And my Grandpa was a big gazetted officer for WB govt.

But he couldnt get the money from his father. They didnt have that much even with good govt salary. Raising 6 children took a lot.

My dad even with his Gold medal and connections couldnt get a loan from ANY bank to go to America. He missed the scholarship and joined the college where he still remains. 

He still talks about it to this day. I think thats part of a reason why he's so angry and abusive. he could have achieved even greater things in life but couldnt because of money.

Was playing around with WhatsApp status in the morning, making fun of the policies how when we need more medical supplies and personal protection equipment to save lives, the government is making arrangements for the end with keeping you locked up close to family and showing you Ramayana.
Some people had a problem with that, ended up arguing with me, 2 of which turned into a fight.
Both of them either told me that I shouldn't be complaining or the way I am criticising about is wrong.

Both of them ended up telling me how I think similar to ’Jamat’ people and how I should just shut up and do my job, also how everybody else is doing their jobs and making India proud, while I'm just criticising.

One of them ended up attacking me personally, and hence I blocked him, and the other one ended up blocking me since I wasn't respectful of the elders.

I thought I was just expressing my scepticisms and was being creative, but supposedly even working hard under life-threatening conditions (avoidable), doesn't give you the right to criticise the government.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

72,[Rant]India isn't going to get better.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gkspn1/rantindia_isnt_going_to_get_better/,"Currently, India is in pretty pathetic condition. The government is not caring about its citizens and sees them just as numbers for staying in power. India's economic growth is getting more and more pathetic, the government is promoting the Muslim hatred.

This is not the problem I am ranting about, the government can change , we can make it change, but are we going to? BJP is the textbook example of a bad government. But honestly,I don't think BJP is going to lose its power anytime soon. A lot of people in our country have the failed the task of being a citizen. Most of them don't check the facts and think that any disagreement to anything of their liking is an attack on their character. They just cannot tolerate being wrong. This is seen in our homes too,whenever younger says something contradictory to elder's liking, it is seen as either disrespecting the culture or the elders.The government is not the problem,its the people's ignorance and the feeling that they are something special that others aren't. 

But the younger people are going to change the country and make it better,right? I also used to think so,but whenever I see the people around me, I don't think that this generation is going to bring the revolution.I am currently 18,going to pass 12 this year. And even then, some people around me have this mentality of looking the world through lense of either they are with us or against us mentality. What is even worse is that they have this mentality that India is the best country in the world and we are the ones leading everything,irrespective of the facts.This toxic nationalism of the country,combined with the lack of questioning is going to be the downfall of India. This was seen by me a lot when pewdiepie vs T-series happened, I was pretty neutral (little more towards pewdiepie because he is an individual fighting against company). But seeing the dirty tactics used by t-series,that this is India vs world and they are representing the country, I started supporting pewds. And of course, then there were people that thought that I was britisher,should go to their country blah blah (couldn't care less about them). They basically showed me videos of other youtubers spreading hate,and how if they are correct with 500K subscribers, who am I to speak. I told them just like vevo doesn't represent what USA is,how can t-series represent India,its not like we see a girl with bare clothes dancing around,infact we haven't seen one in real life at all. But they were like no,no if everyone says this is right,then this is. But why am I even talking about youtube? Well,I just wanted to tell how everyone is following the most popular thing and not thinking about it themselves and find faults in most generous things to prove other person evil. And because younger generation usually watches these videos.INFACT, they were even against pewdiepie when he donated as it is all a ""publicity stunt"". Ok,let it be, but what has t-series donated?Nope,the same videos were played on the phone again,spreading hatred,telling how India is land of many languages,and if there was t-series of all languages,India ,the greatest country in the world, will crush people like pewdiepie like the scum he is. But why youtube?Because I think the trends of India vs someone really brings out the true mentality of Indians,how racist,sexist and uncaring they are about everyone. What really inspired me to write this rant was tiktok vs youtube and  this clip from one of the videos my friend posted [This](https://youtu.be/w9M34b6WLiw?t=557)(Lakshay Chaudhary, the guy with 857K subscribers, said ""panchar jodne wale aur mistri audience ki baat hi kuch aur hai,tik tok par jo anpadh audience hai,alag hi swaad hai unka.Panchar jodne wali audience sirf mujra dekhti hai,interactive nahi hoti.

80,Indian school teachers and sadism,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fhxhg1/indian_school_teachers_and_sadism/,"Do Indian school teachers sometimes take up teaching because they like bullying children?

I ask because although I’m 30 years old and my high school years are a thousand years behind me, I’ve always believed that part of the reason I used to get picked on and bullied by my peers in my teens so much is because they noticed how much certain teachers would pick on me and since children are impressionable, they thought it was ok to do the same. I think teachers saw me as an 'easy target' and got some of rush out of bullying me.

Children follow by example. If adults bully, children will do the same.

There have been so many instances of teachers simply acting unprofessional and mentally unstable when there is no reason to. Don’t get me wrong; I’m all for discipline but beating students up like you are training for a Rambo movie, verbally abusing a student like you’re some kinda raging alcoholic trying to win a screaming contest in a bar fight (you get the picture), mentally harassing a student because your husband hits on your student’s family friend’s older daughter at a mutual social gathering (yeah, that actually happened with me)....are all unacceptable :-| :-| :-|

Has anyone else experienced situations like this when you were in high school too?

84,Update: 2 spammy sites have now filed fraudulent DMCA notices using impersonating site & MY name,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ge0nrp/update_2_spammy_sites_have_now_filed_fraudulent/,"Hi r/India, on Sunday I [shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gcudxm/help_spammy_sites_have_been_copying_content_now/) the website content rip-off issue I've been dealing with, including the creation of an impersonating website and SM accounts. The SM accounts on LinkedIn and Twitter are still active.

Since that post, I have received 2 fraudulent DMCA notices against my site by the impersonating dot IN site signed with MY name - One via my host ([screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Dt7Sju7.png)) and another via LinkedIn ([see screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/wxYgmJJ.png))

To deal with this: 

* I have reached out to my host with brief information requesting how this can be tackled. I have not received a response. I believe a counter-notice is the only form they understand. **UPDATE** I filed a counter-notice. There was no other way. My host emailed back saying they process all notices filed completely and I must remove the content within 48 hours or risk suspension. This is so messed up.

* A few minutes back, I posted on Google's Webmaster forum ([link](https://support.google.com/webmasters/thread/44608574?hl=en))
with an entire laundry list of evidence and other shady practices of Metro Rail News and Urban Transport News. All facts are highlighted. Please check it out and upvote the webmaster thread, if possible.

* I have also sent a direct email to John (Google's Webmaster trend analyst) https://twitter.com/JohnMu


What should be my next steps? I need to address two issues:

**First issue**: Responding to the fraudulent DMCA filed against my site by the impersonating site (owned by UTN). My host has told me to ""remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material within 48 hours, and provide written notice to us to that effect when completed."" I fear these shady guys will file more fraudulent notices to have my website suspended.
**UPDATE** I filed a counter-notice. There was no other way. My host said they process all notices filed completely and I must remove the content within 48 hours or risk suspension.

> “Unfortunately, we are not able to make determinations as to the validity of a DMCA notice. If the notice is properly submitted, we are required to take action. The notice was properly submitted. In this case we would be forced to disable the account for the claimed infringement if the material is not removed before the warning period expires.

> If it is your position that the notice is invalid, a counter-claim notice must be submitted and the material in question taken offline for a 10 to 14 business day blackout period. If the complainant does not file legal action against your client in that time, the material may be reposted. “

**Second issue**: Put a stop to this unethical shady behavior? I'm at a loss. full disclosure - I'm a private person, don't like attention and just want to concentrate on writing for my site.


**UPDATE**  - I found their impersonating FB page. When I was out for 1.5 years, they used it to promote/share their Urban Transport News links. All 3 SM accounts are still active - can you guys please report?

85,My Narcissistic Ex falsely claimed I physically assaulted her on social media (with backstory),https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gikfgo/my_narcissistic_ex_falsely_claimed_i_physically/,"Using Alt account for obv reasons. Title says it all. I have screenshots, everything. She tells some people in private chat that I did infact do it, and to someone else she says it was a joke and must take it in humor. I was dreading for this moment since the breakup, I knew she would not let me off the hook so easily, I was sure she was crazy and delusional. There are marks on her hand, which she posted online today, they are of my mothers hands. The day we broke up, we got into a big fight (basically just her, while I was trying to get her to calm down), she got out of the car and strated running around on the side of the road in dead middle of the night. Thats when I had it, and called my parents to get me out of there before she could make the situation any worse. As my parents got there, my mom grabbed her arm as she tried to run away towards the highway and put her in her car. The marks are from that. She could have been hit by a truck and died that day, I still have scars from that. I blamed myself personally responsible for dragging her to this level, and finally managed to calm her down by involving families and got things under control. But, I am scared she will continue to use all of her energy to ruin my life in one way or the other even in the future. I know this sounds far-fetched and crazy, but I want to simply move on from it, we had some good times but mostly bad times, and its good that we found out early enough that we werent the right people for each other. However, I cannot simply go out in public with common friends trying to doubt me whether I am a physical abuser or not. It is fucking with my head so bad, I dont know what to do. I have been extremely nice to her parents, helped them out with things more than she ever did, and I know my boundaries very well when it comes to respecting women. I told my parents about it, and I did convey to her how I am absolutely pissed off through a common friend, so I hope it stops. But I highly doubt, as what I read about Narcissistic personalities online, I find they love taking things out of context, gaslighting and adding fuel to the fire. She has lied to her family and friends quite extensively, and I wouldnt be surprised if I find out she was lying to me about things as well. Today, I threatened to let her family know about a lot of shit that she did and talked about if she continued such erratic behavior, again through the same mutual friend, and somehow she took the entire conversation out of context only leaving the threat part and posted another story. I am dumbfounded by the level of anxiety and PTSD she is giving me and my family, and also making me act impulsively and basically me looking like a fool in the end. I dont know what I/we should do.

Yet, comments and replies are filled with men and even some god awful women saying ""not all men"" ""don't you believe in equality"" ""what about the snapchat case"" ""haha caught your feminist hypocrisy"" like bhenchod of course she doesn't mean all men and of course snapchat case will be handled differently. 

STOP LIVING IN AMERICA DIGITALLY. We are in india and mysogny is rampant here. Literally every close girl friend of mine has faced abuse. No one is demanding something hardcore like the abolishment of men and patriarchy whatever, feminism in india is important, valid, and it's only asking to bring women on an equal playing field.  

Do women use feminism to falsely accuse people? Yes. It has happened WITH ME. But does that mean we need to bring up these arguments during a case like boislockerroom where clearly the dudes were in the wrong? Fuck anuvva all she did was bring light the situation and we shouldn't give a rats ass about who she is no one is labelling her a hero. Uska hypocrisy bhi alag se handle hona chahiye.

91,The Epidemic of Locker Room Boys,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gnxmef/the_epidemic_of_locker_room_boys/,"  

**LOCKER ROOM BOYS**

This morning I woke up to 10s-100s of stories by women condemning the action of an Instagram group ‘Bois locker room’. The “boys” or as I like to call them – ‘*rich daddy’s sons who think owning a Royal Enfield is a great personality’* allegedly shared morphed photos of underage girls, body shaming and slut-shaming them on the group chat. 

It disgusted me, made me feel ill, but did not surprise me. Growing up I have realized that a lot of men (the majority of whom I know) have said at least a couple of very misogynistic things, some even worse than that group in front of me. 

**DEBUNKING ARGUMENTS** –

**1.** Let’s start with the most important one that anti-feminists use : **False Rape Claims**

\- ‘On the question of false rape, her findings were mixed. More than one third of the 460 cases involved young people who had engaged in consensual sex outside marriage until their parents found out and used the criminal justice system to end the relationship.

\- ""Families are more willing to have the stigma of rape rather than having the stigma of their daughter choosing her own sex or life partner,"" she says. Shrinivasan found that many of these cases dealt with inter-caste or mixed-religion relationships which are considered taboo in conservative society.

\- ""I was repeatedly seeing stories of women being picked up in moving cars, being given a cold drink laced with sedatives which would render them unconscious, and then they would be raped,"" she said. ""But when I started reading more and more cases I realized that there are patterns to how complaints are filed. So this sedative-laced drink becomes important because it is necessary to show that consent was not given."" 

\- ""The parents say, 'You've lost your virginity, it's going to be impossible to get you married, you file this case, he'll get scared and he'll marry you,'"" says Shrinivasan. ""In some cases it would be the argument of the defence that the woman was trying to abstract money,"" she says. ""But I cannot think of a case where this was proven.""

\- While Shrinivasan's study would appear to indicate that the proportion of false rape cases in Delhi is high by international standards - in more than one country, researchers have put the proportion of false rape claims at about 8% of the total - academic Nithya Nagarathinam argues that this is a distraction from a more pressing issue, the under-reporting of rape. 

\- ""Although there has been a jump in rape reporting since the Delhi gang-rape, there are still many cases that go unreported and there are so many reasons for that,"" she says, pointing to traditional patriarchal structures that mean violence against women is consistently downplayed. ""That is a more serious issue to me than a few cases where the parents have probably wrongly accused the man."" Nagarathinam cites a 2014 study using data from the Indian National Crime Records Bureau and the National Family Health Surveys that suggests only 6% of incidents of sexual violence against women are reported to the police.’ [https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-38796457](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-38796457). 

2. Rape claims that come after years of the incident are only to malign the character of the man and not true.

\- This is again false as psychologists agree that a sexual assault victim’s response at times is to pretend that the attack never happened to them or suppress their memory of the incident. So these are very rarely false. 

\- When certain men who assaulted a woman become a public figure, their victims feel compelled to tell the truth because they know these men abuse their power and so for these women, this becomes their chance of calling out their abusers so as to stop further misconduct. And this is very important in some cases where men might use their power to suppress legal proceedings against their selves. 

3. Feminists are trying to make all men look like predators or Feminists hate all men. 

\- Again this isn’t true. Feminists are not trying to make all men look like assholes. They’re trying to show a systematic problem that is the patriarchal society that values men’s dominance more than a women’s freedom. 

\- Not only movements like #NotAllMen or #MenToo are generally a retaliation against women standing up to their abusers but was and still is a forefront of the right-wing extremist political ideologies and has been co-opted by them to shift the narrative from ‘Women are oppressed and want equal rights’ to ‘Women are trying to destroy our culture and forcing a female dominant society’ which is wrong and at best a strawman argument. 

\-  

4. Women are getting extra rights. 

\- Women are not getting extra rights. This is a false equivalency 

\- The best example to explain this is the free bus and local travel for women in Delhi which was started by AAP government. They introduced free bus rides for women and are going to roll over free metro or subsidized metro rates for women in the future. 

\- Now some people are characterizing this as extra rights for women. 

\- Now to understand this let’s begin with some basic points- Delhi has been and still is one of the most unsafe cities for women in India and the World. So by this argument, it can be established that social security to a woman is impinged upon which means they already do not have similar security as a man as they are disproportionately targeted only on the basis of gender.

\- By this, we can conclude that providing more security to a woman means we are giving them a similar right to security than actually providing them with more than men. 

\- Finally not only did women feel much safer with this scheme by AAP, they also noticed that the harassment on buses decreased. 

5. Women shouldn’t upload revealing photos and shouldn’t send nudes to men. It’s their fault that they weren’t cautious.

\- The first one is completely arbitrary based on the culture. What might be revealing to you might be normal to someone else. 

\- Not only that but a woman’s right to her body is more important than a culture or religion’s right to morality in a democratic country. A woman can do whatever she wants and post whatever she wants anyplace she wants. Nobody has a right to shame or harm her because of this.

\- Secondly, sending nudes is a known and completely natural sexual activity – ‘exhibitionism’ and is not a crime. If she consents it to another person (her partner or a friend or anyone she knows), it’s her right to do so, but these men have no right to share it. That is a crime as it should be. Shaming women on the basis of nudes is absolutely patriarchal and barbaric and is significant of a certain mentality of controlling women. 

\- Another important point is that if you’re saying that it’s a women’s job to be completely closeted to protect herself from sexual or violent crimes, you mean that a women’s human rights are less important the civic duties of the perpetrator of said crimes. (It’s not your job to not get murdered right?)

6. Men and Women’s rights should be covered equally by the media instead of focusing on only Women’s rights

\- Not only does media not cover women’s rights but it also shapes it much worse and is almost always causing trouble to victims

\- One example is – “Pollachi ‘sexual abuse’ complainant says she was not sexually abused” was a headline by a known newspaper. In reality, the complainant had always maintained that she had not been raped, but had been stripped naked and filmed without her consent. By twisting these words to say that ‘she had not been sexually abused’, while also putting ‘sexual abuse’ in quotes, the headline casts her testimony as falsehood.

7. The Current False Rape Claim case that came to light today. (I’m not going to use anyone’s names because it’s not my right to)

\- Alright so let’s summarize what happened. A girl accused a boy online of sexually assaulting her 2 years ago and used his name in the post. This was picked up by a lot of Instagram accounts and then they shared it. Quite possibly a lot of people on social media went on to harass the guy. The boy committed suicide. Finally, the family of the boy put a post online stating that he was innocent and that the girl did this for fame and again people started sharing this instead.

\- So who is right here and who is wrong? This question might seem very easy to answer but chances are you’re quite wrong. And also I am no one to judge or are you. Only a court can decide that. 

\- Women who have been victims of sexual assault have vastly different coping mechanisms and there have been numerous studies that would show how much array of responses can be seen as a response. But the most common are- PTSD, Depression, and Rape Trauma syndrome.

\- Social media has taken over our whole world and is now a counted coping mechanism for women. It has both negative and positive effects on victims of abuse. 

\- I read the post of the girl who called out her potential abuser. The story wasn’t unbelievable and was quite the characteristic of how many sexual assaults take place. So claiming she’s lying is absolutely wrong. The reason she couldn’t have proved that the boy had done is because rape allegations are already difficult to prove and also because years later it becomes almost impossible to prove. This might have been a manic phase of calling out her abuser if she was suffering from bipolar disorder quite easily caused by such an act of abuse.

\- Now let’s look at the other side. The boy committed suicide because of retaliation from social media and if the case didn’t actually happen he could’ve felt a sudden mental trauma because of such a large online audience trying to hurt him or his family. 

\- My next few lines might be very hurtful to some, but the truth is a hard pill to swallow. Him committing suicide does not mean he might’ve been innocent. A lot of studies in the past have shown that suicide has not only been used to flee justice but also that some people consider it the ultimate form of justice for their sins ([https://lawprofessors.typepad.com/evidenceprof/2018/10/assume-that-a-defendant-who-has-been-charged-with-a-crime-attempts-suicide-while-detained-prior-to-trial-should-evidence-of.html](https://lawprofessors.typepad.com/evidenceprof/2018/10/assume-that-a-defendant-who-has-been-charged-with-a-crime-attempts-suicide-while-detained-prior-to-trial-should-evidence-of.html), [https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=3143&context=law\_lawreview](https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=3143&context=law_lawreview))

\- Now, this in no way proves that he did it or he didn’t but his suicide is also not something to shame the supposed victim for. 

\- **The sole responsibility for this suicide and a future one shall lie on the social media circus and not on either the accused or the victim (until it’s proven that the claim was false) simply because internet shouldn’t dictate who’s innocent or not.** 

\- **The reason she never filed a case does not mean he’s innocent and just because he committed suicide does not mean he’s guilty.**

\- A rape claim that might have resulted in a legal case has been derailed by the so called heroes who not only create an opinion on these stories to boost their ego and for their own political purposes. So for the last time –**THE ONLY PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAN’S SUICIDE OR THE WOMAN’S HARASSMENT THAT IS ENSUING RIGHT NOW IS EVERYONE WHO IS VEHEMENTLY DRAWING CONCLUSIONS OF THEIR OWN ON AND ACTING LIKE IT’S PROOF FOR SOMETHING. BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF SOCIAL MEDIA JUDGES, YOU EITHER KILLED AN INNOCENT PERSON OR ARE HARASSING ONE NOW. STOP AND RE-THINK, THE ‘LOCKER ROOM THING’ AND THIS ARE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AND SOMEONE PAID WITH THEIR LIFE FOR YOUR EGO. DO NOT DIRECT YOUR HATE TO THE FAMILY OF THE BOY OR THE GIRL.**

**CRIME AGAINST WOMEN IN INDIA –**

Two main types of rape that are prevalent in Indian Society which are political rapes and honor (izzat) rapes. 

Here are some harrowing statistics related to crimes against women - 

1.  “Violence against women in India is actually more present than it may appear at first glance, as many expressions of violence are not considered crimes, or may otherwise go unreported or undocumented due to certain Indian cultural values and beliefs. These reasons all contribute to India's Gender Inequality Index rating of 0.524 in 2017, putting it in the bottom 20% of ranked countries for that year” (1). 

2.  “A total of 2,44,270 incidents of crime against women (both under IPC and SLL) were reported in the country during the year 2012 as compared to 2,28,650 in the year 2011 recording an increase of 6.4% during the year 2012. These crimes have continuously increased during 2008 - 2012 with 1,95,856 cases in the year 2008, 2,03,804 cases in 2009 and 2,13,585 cases in 2010 and 2,28,650 cases in 2011 and 2,44,270 cases in the year 2012” (2) – By a report by NCRB (National Crime Records Bureau, 2013). This increased to 329243 in 2017 (6).

3. 65% of Indian men believe women should tolerate violence in order to keep the family together, and women sometimes deserve to be beaten. (3) In January 2011, the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) Questionnaire reported that 24% of Indian men had committed sexual violence at some point during their lives (3).

4. Exact statistics on the extent of case occurrences are very difficult to obtain, as a large number of cases go unreported. This is due in large part to the threat of ridicule or shame on the part of the potential reporter, as well as an immense pressure not to damage the family's honor. (4) For similar reasons, law enforcement officers are more motivated to accept offers of bribery from the family of the accused, or perhaps in fear of more grave consequences, such as Honor Killings (4).

**CONCLUSION-** 

1. Women are not trying to earn fame by making a rape case. IT HAPPENS. Every woman has a right to be heard and believed. They should be believed in a fashion where they’re not shamed for coming out until a verdict is passed. 

2.  Instead of teaching girls how to dress and behave, we have an urgent need to make boys realize their civil duties and teach them that women are equal and that women are not just objects of desire for them.

3. Our cultures that have been for centuries forcing us to believe that men are better and that women have certain gender roles – needs to go. Cultures that are resistant to change are blatantly misguiding people (No single religion holds this problem, all of them do. Do not use this for your bigotry. Accept your mistakes and solve them instead of counting others’)

4. I’m not saying that false rape claims do not happen. They do. But they’re very incidental and the hysteria surrounding it is wrong. And only a family who has faced it would know what it means. 

5. One last thing - if you’re still blind enough to believe woman are not facing a crisis of security and respect, or if you believe that you have no stand on this, then you’re a part of the problem because you’d rather let oppression happen than acknowledge it. 

***The hottest places in Hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict.***

\- ***Martin Luther King Jr.***

Tldr, There is no such thing as false rape case epidemic. But there is definitely an epidemic of women’s suffrage. This boys locker room might’ve been a wake up call but the social media storm destroyed it and divided us into two different sets of people - one who can acknowledge that there’s an injustice against women and the other ones who can’t accept facts.",abuse,10.0,0,epidemic locker room boys,locker room boys morning woke 10s 100s stories women condemning action instagram group bois locker room boys

97,Need some legal advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ggk9d5/need_some_legal_advice/,"Hello folks. Im a regular @ r/india but using throwaway for obvious reasons.

My brother has some issues with his marriage & I need some advice on how to protect our family.

My brother & sister-in-law had a baby in December. She went to her parents' house in a nearby city for delivery & the baby was born some 10 days before the expected date. So my bro wasnt able to be there with her at the time of birth but made it to the hospital just 4 hours after birth.

The girl's parents have made a huge issue out of this & are accusing my brother of 'not caring enough for the child'. I mean, his wife basically has his debit card with her (she doesn't have a job now but had one in the past & we did not ask her to quit it either). She has been free to use it whenever she wants to & my brother doesn't ask her about what she spends on unless its at a hospital, which makes sense. Mother-in-law had a heated argument with my brother over this minor issue & my brother & wife stopped talking to each other for a couple of weeks.

We met the baby in their house for a ritual on completing one-month & even then it was an uneasy calm.

Then lockdown happened & they haven't met since.

Things cooled down after a few weeks but the baby has had some minor health issues & their family are hiding the baby's health reports from us. They also decline to share the baby's weight with us & my mother was verbally abused in vulgar words by the in-laws when she asked. They accused us of 'not taking care of the baby'. Seriously? There is a fucking lockdown & inter-state transport is not allowed. Money is not a problem either as mentioned above.

Recently the girl & her parents laid down some criteria to continue the marriage & return back to my bro's house:

1. My brother has to disclose his bank balance to the girl's parents. My brother had shared those details with his wife post marriage 4 years ago but he is not comfortable sharing now as the info will be relayed to her parents. FYI, he works at a top MNC & owns a 3 BHK house in a major Indian Metro. So I don't see the point of worrying about financial security.

2. My parents should not visit my brother's house at any cost. They are already a nuclear family but the girl wants him to completely sever the relationship it seems. FYI, my parents live in a neighbouring state & just visit once in a while. Even when they visit, its my old mother who does all the household chores & runs the family, so his wife can't accuse us of that either.

We honestly dont understand what their motive is, as their criteria doesn't make a lot of sense.

They are now threatening to file a harassment case if their conditions are not met, although there was no dowry involved in the marriage & there were no requests from us post mrg either. They have zero proof to produce in court anyway.

Ive advised my brother to seek legal advice asap but he is too naive & brushes it saying 'they don't mean it seriously'.

AFAIK, dowry harassment in India seems to be a case of 'guilty until proven innocent' scenario. We are confident of winning any case as would be a fake accusation & they don't have any proof to back their claims.

But I don't want my 65+ parents with health issues to undergo any legal hassles or in the worst case wrongful detention for no fault of theirs. **So pls provide some pointers on how I could safeguard my family from legal issues/wrongful detention**

98,The Internet Should Not Become a Boys Club,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gf5oad/the_internet_should_not_become_a_boys_club/,"https://preview.redd.it/0igadjs27cx41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f556e6017a1c0e38e2e34e5ad6abc79f7386d31

### Tl;dr

We wrote to the Ministry of Women & Child Development and Delhi Commission for Women about the need to address image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material on the internet in a rights respecting manner in light of the recent 'Boiz Locker Room' incident. Through this representation, we have tried to provide a broader picture of inadequacies in the existing legal and institutional framework to address these problems and highlighted the role of patriarchal socio-cultural attitudes in emboldening young boys to commit such acts. We have also made nine specific recommendations to ensure the internet remains a safe space for young girls and women where they are allowed to participate on an equal basis and express themselves freely.

### Background

In a recent headline grabbing incident, teenage male students from Delhi were called out for sharing sexualized images of young women including girls below the age of 18 years on an Instagram group called 'Boiz Locker Room.' [**Media reports**](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/bois-locker-room-case-5-boys-questioned-over-messages-on-instagram-group-6396040/) suggest that the boys used the group to sexualize images posted by girls on their social media accounts and even shared morphed images. More disturbingly, [**reports**](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bois-locker-room-delhi-schoolboys-create-group-to-share-lewd-photos-chats-on-classmates-1674303-2020-05-04) indicate that in addition to non-consensually sharing images, the boys made misogynistic remarks objectifying the girls and even threatened to leak nude images of the girls who exposed the group.

### Need for Accountability and Rehabilitation

We, at IFF, have consistently sought reform of India's obscenity laws which are rooted in notions of victorian morality rather than individual autonomy and consent. However, online image based sexual abuse is very different from consensual pornography and it subjects women to immense psychological trauma and social stigma. Therefore, there exists a legitimate need to prohibit and punish such harmful conduct. 

Nevertheless, we must be wary of adopting punitive and carceral approaches in cases where the perpetrators are minors and there is no accompanying violence. For young offenders, the focus must be on re-education and rehabilitation, and we must acknowledge the role played by patriarchal socio-cultural attitudes which teach boys to objectify and dehumanize women from a young age.

### Lack of Institutional Capacity

The government has established helplines, online portals and special investigative units to address cyber crimes against women and children but these measures have failed to result in greater reporting, investigation and prosecution of online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material. As per the National Crime Records Bureau’s [**latest Crime in India Report**](https://ncrb.gov.in/crime-india-2018), there were only 862 cases registered under Section 67A (publication of sexually explicit material) and Section 67B (publication of sexually explicit material depicting children) of the IT Act in 2018. Similarly, only 781 cases were registered under Section 14 and 15 (storage and possession of child pornography) of the POCSO Act in 2018. 

These figures are shockingly low considering India’s large population, growing internet user base and the relatively higher number of cases reported for other cybercrimes. The scope of the problem is much larger than these figures indicate as out of the total 16.9 million reports received by the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children in the United States in 2019, India accounted for 1,987,430 suspected child sexual exploitation reports. Therefore, proactive information disclosure and performance audits are absolutely necessary to ensure that existing mechanisms to eliminate online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material are functioning effectively.

### Rights Respecting Solutions

In our representation, we have stressed that governments should not force intermediaries to adopt rights harming measures such as weakening of encryption standards.  We had also previously highlighted these concerns in [**our submission**](https://internetfreedom.in/porn-is-complex-we-call-for-further-study/) to the Ad Hoc Rajya Sabha Committee on the impact of pornography on children headed by Shri Jairam Ramesh. 

It is our belief that strong encryption is necessary to protect the privacy and security of individuals, businesses and government actors who use the internet, and this is especially true for groups which lack social power such as women and other marginalized communities. Any weakening of encryption standards would leave us all vulnerable to misuse of our personal data and communications by bad actors including malicious hackers, organized criminals, terrorist groups and hostile nation states.   


The importance of security and privacy enhancing technologies like encryption for women is also borne out of past experience of hackers targeting accounts of women to access their private photos. For instance, in 2014, hackers leaked over 500 private photos of various female celebrities by breaching iCloud’s services. Therefore, any decision to weaken the security of our intimate communications  by mandating weak encryption standards or creation of backdoors would leave women even more vulnerable to online image based sexual abuse. 

### Final Recommendations

In the spirit of constructive solution oriented engagement, we have offered the following nine recommendations to ensure the internet is a safe space for women and young girls where they are allowed to participate on an equal basis and express themselves freely:

>1. Seek information from authorities responsible for facilitating reporting of online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material about the number of complaints received from individuals, intermediaries, watchdog groups and international law enforcement agencies.  
>  
>2. Seek information from authorities responsible for investigating and prosecuting online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material about the number of complaints in which follow up action was taken such as investigation, identification of perpetrators and filing of criminal charges.  
>  
>3. Conduct an audit to evaluate the performance of existing helplines, online reporting portals and specialized investigation units.  
>  
>4. Provide more funding, personnel and technical resources to existing helplines, online portals and specialized investigation units after an assessment of their needs.  
>  
>5. Work closely with schools and colleges to create a Standard Operating Procedure \[SOP\] which provides safe spaces for young girls and women to report such illegal behaviour in a manner which does not invite larger social stigma and also provides them the agency to choose the next steps they feel comfortable with.  
>  
>6. Encourage intermediaries to adhere to industry best practices for eliminating online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material which may require deployment of specialized software or fast-tracking human review by content moderators in such cases.  
>  
>7. Any technical measures adopted to address online image based sexual abuse and child sexual abuse material should not undermine the privacy and security of all users by weakening encryption. Instead, the focus should be on capacity building and providing adequate resources to law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute these offences.  
>  
>8. Ensure that students receive mandatory and regular gender sensitization and sex education in their schools which is centered on the principles of consent and women’s autonomy.  
>  
>9. Consider partnerships with women’s rights groups, child rights groups, digital rights groups and social networks to collaboratively work towards leveraging technology to sensitise young people and parents about healthy sexual conduct and behaviour.

In the end, we would like to acknowledge that a lot of our work on issues like online harassment is shaped by prior research done by other digital rights organizations like the Internet Democracy Project, Point of View and Centre for Internet & Society and we would urge you to follow their work as well!

I know a few parents are quite liberal and open minded, but they’re mostly limited to affluent families in metropolitan cities. But, the same can’t be said for most Indian families.

I always have a feeling that Indians suffer from Stockholm syndrome since childhood, they’re mentally exhausted by constant nagging or sometimes abuses by their parents and choose to submit/surrender and confuse obedience with love. Many Indian girls also like to believe their parents are open-minded and progressive just because they’re ‘allowed’ to go to a co-Ed school/college, until they start dating then all hell breaks loose.",abuse,,0,many indians like believe parents progressive liberal,seen quite lot cultural rants internet unlike comments tend defend parents justify progressive liberal parents like take offence whenever see someone calling indian parents conservative backward narcissists know parents quite liberal open minded mostly limited affluent families metropolitan cities said indian families always feeling indians suffer stockholm syndrome since childhood mentally exhausted constant nagging sometimes abuses parents choose submit surrender confuse obedience love many indian girls also like believe parents open minded progressive allowed go co ed school college start dating hell breaks loose,many indian like believe parent progressive liberal ,many ind lik believ par progress lib ,mani indian like believ parent progress liber ,many indian like believe parent progressive liberal ,many ind lik believ par progress lib ,mani indian like believ parent progress liber

103,why are so many indians and sri lankans so arrogant?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g4i22d/why_are_so_many_indians_and_sri_lankans_so/,"I know they're not the same but i will just say india instead of saying ""India and sri lanka"" every single time because india is more relevant to my subjective experience and because of simplicity, so im not meaning to offend anybody but i've met people from both bakcgrounds and i like and respect their culture but i've noticed something that i usually ignore unitl it's just too annoying

&#x200B;

So yeah, maybe I don't know so many indians and of course i can't speak for all of them, but literally every single one of the ones i've been exposed to except for mutahar from ""some ordinary gamers"" youtube channel are very arrogant and/or egotistical. For example i've met and talked to or been exposed to people from india or with an indian background on the internet, living in canada, in my country and abroad in other countries in europe and also in china and japan. Oh and of course indian scammers through the phone and in videos (lol).

Some of the things I've noticed a lot is that they will say India is the greatest country ever, better and more powerful than the US, russia and china combined, they will bloat and lie in a ""lie, cheat or steal"" kind of attitude in order to not admit that maybe they are not the best country or that they personally are not the greatest in math or tech in the world.

&#x200B;

Like for example i'm from a third world country and it's okay, got no problem with that. When I went to school a classmate who is from india while in canada kept saying how india is the greatest nation to ever exist and me and a friend just told him that was stupid nationalism and even if it mattered it's obvious india can't be the best at everything because no country can but man was he stubborn about the matter.

&#x200B;

I've noticed many people like for example phone scammers act this way to justify shitty actions, especially against americans, which i mean, yeah, everybody hates americans, i get it, but why make stuff up to justify yourself or why pretend or lie about being better than others?

&#x200B;

Also i've noticed many times that many indians cheat or lie and when caught they will never ever accept it, this happened with some people who stole money from my parents and even on private face to face conversations they acted as if it never happened when everybody involved knows it did, there was no point on lying. Months later that same person asked for money and said he would call the cops because of the illegal practices we did if he didnt have the money. And of course there were no illegal practices, he could've just said he was going to sue us on fake allegations but he chose to flat out lie in a way that even a 5 year old could tell it was a lie. That lie was so stupid that of course the cops never showed up and he never sued us.

&#x200B;

Now don't get me wrong, ive met some really cool indian people, and some of the people that i've seen having this attitude are actually very good people, or at least most of the time, but I just don't get it, everytime i have called on or seen an indian person being called on some arrogant or selfish behaviour they traight up LIE with the worst lies ever, they would make up literally ANYTHING before accepting they may be wrong and not be the best person in the whole planet.

&#x200B;

I just find it interesting that this kind of personalities have been present every single time i have been exposed to indian people. Especially since ive seen a lot of indian people who will cheat or backstab others without remorse and then just lie about it compared to people from other cultures ive met. (ive travelled and lived aborad a lot so indian people are just one of the several cultures ive been exposed to a lot , and this came to my mind after a long time when reading people expressing the same feelings online

&#x200B;

it's like if you get caught pointing a gun to someones head and say ""yeah, it wasn't me, it was someone else"" like dude i saw it was you, did you really think that would change my mind?

&#x200B;

I mean is there a cultural reason behind it?

&#x200B;

Is india a very nationalist country that brainwashes people?

&#x200B;

do indian people live in denial?

&#x200B;

or maybe it's just a huge coincidence? then why am i not the only one who thinks that?

&#x200B;

the best example i can think of is the ""designated pooping street"" meme where some guy tries so hard to make india look like a first world country when it clearly isnt and everybody knows it. Why pretend being someone you're not? as a fellow third world country dweller i just accept my country is great in some aspects and needs huge improvement in others, it's okay

&#x200B;

I just don't get it

&#x200B;

what is your own opinon on it? maybe some of you actually have seen this on your fellow countrymen and actually dont like it? or am projecting a wrongful perception of people from india?

I'd like to know what you guys think :)

&#x200B;

edit: after rereading my post i think i left there a chance to sound like i'm saying all people i know from india are bad people, just in case, it was only a handful of truly bad experiences but the proud/arogant attitude is what i'm asking about, i'm not saying all indians are cheaters or back stabbers, i'm saying that the ones that actually are (like in any culture there will be some) will have this attitude and it's interesting how far they will go to keep a lie or avoid criticism even if it's clear they are wrong.

104,Indian Parents: Level of legal control,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fpws6m/indian_parents_level_of_legal_control/,"I grew up in the US under a patriarchal, abusive father. He hit my mother until she called the police. Then he started throwing things to cause distress while evading the law (mom wouldn't call the cops on that, just physical abuse). He did the same to me, opened our mail, forged our signatures on documents where convenient, and was just a miserable person in general. 

Even in the Indian American community most people despise him for various reasons, so I know this is not normal.

I no longer speak to him. He tried to force the IRS and DMV  (in the US) to hand over my information but was refused.

I have wondered what life would have been like if he didn't move to the US.  2 questions regarding this:

1. I know in India this behavior is still not normal. My question is, what percentage of Indian men become deeply abusive like this? I have suspected he grew up under equally damaging conditions. My grandpa passed away when I was 5 or 6 so I could never tell. 
2. If I ceased contact with him, except in India, does the father have special powers to get information for adult children? Perhaps by lying to authorities in some way (""My son needs supervision due to illness)? Years later he is still trying using various schemes, most of which are illegal to uncover where I've moved (I've considered reporting him to put a halt to it).

113,Advice on Sister's Divorce,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gb2yd8/advice_on_sisters_divorce/,"My sister got married in Jan 2018, and within some months of living with the toxic and abusive family, left it. Actually it look a lot of convincing from my side to agree her and my parents to file for a divorce. We filed for a divorce in August, 2018.

We have filed cases against the husband for dowry (which he took), 498a (there was a lot of domestic violence due to less dowry, etc), etc. But in the past two years, the husband has never appeared in the court. He keeps sending his lawyer who keeps on giving false and silly excuses like ""mom's sick"" or that he's too busy with the heavy workload (he works for the government).

It's almost been two years now, and just before this Corona mess, the court had issued a warrant. But now due to the lockdown, he has again got some time and we don't know how long it will take.

The divorce is taking a toll on us now. My mom's worrying constantly, keeps crying. My sister thankfully got a government job post filing the divorce, and she does not have a baby. I keep telling them that life's much bigger than these superficial relationships, and finding a new husband wouldn't be tough. But to no avail. Typical middle-class parents.

I need advice on how to take things forward. If you know of some really good divorce lawyer who will not be too heavy on our pocket-books, please PM (in and around Ghaziabad). I also want to do mental counselling for both my sister and my mother. I need help here guys, please. I am devastated with what's becoming of my family. Thankfully, there are no financial hardships right now. But the mental anguish is on some other level. I would rather have financial hardships than this. We had a wonderful family but everything seems to be falling apart now. On top of this is my sister's extremely rude/entitled behaviour towards us. But I can only imagine the mental trauma she has undergone.

118,How do I strengthen my mind?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fy0s1a/how_do_i_strengthen_my_mind/,"I literally have no friends because I'm straight up unlikable and repulsive. This is something that people universally agree, be my school or college or neighbours or even some relatives. 

People avoid me and I avoid people. 


Issue is, it's kinda hard to be alone all the time. But I also don't want to change because frankly, people never change. 

I am also a danger to people around me so even my mom agrees to an extent that it might be good that no girls even like looking at me much less like me. So, despite her lifelong wish of seeing me married someday, some part of her doesn't want to get me married. 

Plus even if I did get married I don't want kids. And since this is India and not some western country, almost zero women would want a childfree life.


Anyway, tldr is that It's probably better for me and people around me that I spend my life alone, but at times I just can't take the fact that I don't have a girlfriend or even friends to talk to.

So how do I strengthen my mind so that I don't feel lonely or bad about any physical needs and stuffs. I just want to shut off the world and my own sexual desires completely so that my mind can be freed a bit.

119,Harrassed by Sector 99 Mohali landlord's sister who wishes death to my family,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fradwf/harrassed_by_sector_99_mohali_landlords_sister/,"This goes back to november, but since the lady who rented out her brother's flat had harrassed me so much I am making a public account of it. She has threatened to fabricate stories, wished my parents were dead. She abused me for 2-3 weeks straight and I have decided not to stay quiet anymore as she is vindictive and I believe very jealous.

The  12 month lease was under my father's name as he was the sole tenant. Payable according to the rent were: monthly rent (13500 rupees), electricity and water. There was no mention of any maintenance. The  building was under Puma  realtors who absconded and the owners who took possession of the flats were tasked with maintaining it. Soon there were all kinds of meetings, elections amongst flat owners  to form a committee, and implement mini money making schemes amongst themselves.  For example, Puma realtors left an unpaid electricity bill of 13 lakhs, which gave impetus to side money making schemes in the guise of ""repayment""

My father paid half the year's maintenance unknowingly, as this woman(Amarjeet Raina Bujrall) would send a utility man to collect money each month (about 2500 rupees I believe).  My father thought he was paying tip/bakhshish to the garbage man, guards for their roti/paani.  Instead he paid half a year's maintenance in cash, unknowingly.

Rent was only late  1 month by 2 weeks, because I was traveling out of India and had to send someone physically to the bank, as the account only accepts direct deposits (NRO/NRI account).  The time the rent was late was also when there were floods in Punjab. Her

At some point this lady started pestering my father to vacate the flat as she wanted to take tuitions there. She began badgering him to leave 3 months before the end of the lease. He is a patient with a long lasting condition and her constant badgering was not good for his health.  She would repeatedly call him and talk about his mental state, pushing him. He called me up  more than once and I decided to move him immediately because at around the same time she started insinuating what would happen if he died. I packed and moved him and left the keys with the guard. The flat was fully cleaned and pictures and a video were taken .

I did not inform her, because of her toxic behavior and extremely abusive tone. Her husband and her are bankrupt I believe at this point.

The  rent, electricity and water were fully paid.  She bought up maintenance  and upon  re-reading the lease I let her no that maintenance was not part of the lease. She even wanted 5 rupees per transaction for the money that was deposited as rent! At this point she starts attacking me personally, wishes my family ill and goes to the police station and makes an inspector call. I told the inspector if she has a case, she should get a lawyer. Her vitriol on whatsapp at this point had been going on for 2- 3 weeks.

Couple of things:

1. She has repeatedly threatened me which leads me to believe she will try to sabotage my work/life by fabricating stories. She 'gaslights' and has zero qualms about lying
2. I am a Canadian. She has also threatened to sue me in Canada. I have informed the border control as nobody goes on a tourist visa with the intention of suing. Also I am not even on the lease.
3. Her brother or she has given NO receipts. I have bank deposit slips. Are they evading taxes?
4. I have messaged her on whatsapp of March and let her know that her abuse and threats will not remain in private anymore. Abusers get away with far too much in private. And she's somehow led herself to believe that she's ""morally right""
5. Her abuses are the typical jealous woman kind. They center around my work, how much money I make, my family's health, marital status etc.  She also takes special interest in belittling my elderly father.
6. She is not very intelligent and doesn't have the capacity to understand any reasoning. ABSOLUTELY DUMB. She is the one who made the lease in which no maintenance is mentioned. I tried to reason with her, but have of March let her know that her abuse/threats won't remain  private
7. Some of her abuses:

* Calling my father ""Gursikh Parkinson's"" (because of parkinson's disease),  being derogatory to my parents
* Calling me a bitch
* Calling us absconders, freeloaders
* Telling me she will go to any lengths to harm me
* Stating that the rising corona cases in USA  are high and implying that I should get corona (as I sometimes visit there)
* Her immediate neighbors have insinuated that she is abusive to her kids and other people's kids. So abuse is probably all that she knows.

She does NOT have the money for a lawyer. Going to the police is free. However, never underestimate jealousy and vindictiveness.

We have been married for around 10 yrs.  Our relationship turned sour when we got pregnant with a girl in between the boys that we mutually decided to terminate because she had some severe birth defects and was very unlikely to survive birth.  Since the past 5 years or so we have been sleeping in separate beds in our house , Not much of  a relationship but I decided that I love my boys too much and I will do whatever I need to be close to them.

But of late things have taken a turn for the worse.  Since the past 12 years she has known me I have always been the kind of guy to have a beer or two 4-5 days a week.  She was the same and much worse until she got a DUI last year that ended costing us 20K in lawyer  / uber fees for around three months she wasn't allowed to drive to work. What really hurt me wasn't the fact that she got a DUI but that she would come in late from work and make excuses and I would have to take care of the kids both in the morning and night while being full time employed all in the name of her busy work / conferences.  Once I even found hotel receipt in her car for a night she claimed she worked until 5am in the morning. We live in the suburbs (around 30 miles from the city) and she  chose to attend multiple conferences staying at a hotel in the city further burdening me with kids rather than just simply drive to these conferences.

What has changed recently during the coronavirus lockdown is the she has started accusing me of being of mean to our kids and threatening and abusive to her. She comes running down if I ever try to discipline our kids with a timeout or threat to take away their toys temporarily if they don't follow the rules.  I am talking about things like don't shoot the nerf guns at each other or at daddy's face.  When I asked what she means by threatening and abusive at her. she replied "" I feel like I don't feel safe living here with you when you drink and that if we were living in India where they didn't have good laws regarding domestic violence you would have hit me"". I don't to what to make of it. She thinks that because my parents were physically abusive to each I would do the same to her and the kids when there has not been a single instance of it through 12 years of us knowing each other.  The last straw was when my 8yr old suggested to me after coming back with an afternoon walk with her that he saw a great house for sale in the neighborhood and it would be great if we bought that house as well so mommy could live in that house and daddy could live in this one and he can ride/bike between these houses. When I confronted my wife on it and said it was unacceptable behavior and almost borderline parent alienation her exact response was

""I do disagree. \[8r old\] was excited by the idea and we only talked about how this would potentially work because he could go between the houses and be with either or both of us so frequently. So that is the opposite of parental alienation. It’s actually a maxization of their time with both parents given the situation""

Her parents or my parents don't know about our relationship so I can't talk to her parents and since there's a lockdown in my country, I can't go to see her either. There is no child supportive service in our country (India). 

She sent a pic of herself crying with her hands on her neck saying that it hurts and she thinks she needs to see a doctor. There's no one who she can ask for help. I told her that she should ask her mother to take her to a doctor but I doubt she would ask her. She says she want to leave her home (she has been saying this from a long time) but with no other place to stay, she stucked.

It makes me feel so bad that I couldn't do anything to help her. I don't know what I can do which would help her even the slighest bit.

123,My (24M) girlfriend (23F) says she's been raped and I don't believe her.,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g48y2o/my_24m_girlfriend_23f_says_shes_been_raped_and_i/,"My girlfriend (23F) and I (24M) have been together for 5 months now. We met on tinder and our compatibility came from the fact that both of us have been raped as kids. it took us more than 2 months to get over our haptophobia to even hug each other. We have grown a lot closer than I've seen other people do. We spent the next month being with/near each other as much as we could, during which she told me about all the other abuses that she has suffered.

I'll  take them one at a time, chronologically. First was when she was 3 years old and the help in her house had raped her repeatedly, for this she has had multiple surgeries and even went to court to get justice but the accused was acquitted. Next was when she about 9 or 10 and one of her uncles raped her and no one knew about it. The next one was about this classmate of hers at the age of 14, who she still is in occasional contact with. The next was when she 19, her ex of two years raped her repeatedly and abused her in addition to that. All of these she mentioned to me in the 2nd or 3rd month of us being together. We took a week long trip in the 3rd month where we literally spent each second with each other. On this trip she told me that both her and mother and father had sexually abused her. Up until this point, I had no reason to doubt her and believed her and still do.

She moved to Australia in the fourth month (I am in India) and things were going relatively well, but a month after her move she told me about this time that she was raped by her mother's cousin and two of his friends  and it was her mother who had arranged for the entire thing as a punishment for her. This came as a shock, first I believed her but then I noticed that that some of these followed a pattern (still speculating), wherein whenever things are going normal and nothing exciting is happening she tells me about one of these incidents. Right after this she told me about this guy in Australia who had molested her and gave me a bunch of details about it. Again, I decided to take her word for it. But last night we were having a fight about the fact that i spent hours talking to friends at night, one of whom is a female  and she knows about it. I never lied to her about it and have always given straight replies to all of her questions and after the fight was over and I told her that this won't happen again, she modified her previous account and said that the Australian guy had raped her and gave a bunch of other details about it, which did not match with the previous account.

Now, here's where I stand. I believe her accounts of rape that happened when she was a child, ones relating to her mother (horrible person) and the one about her ex (she has shared some text exchanges between the two of them with me). But I'm not sure about all of the other 'stories' because I have no way to verify these and she won't let me call the cops on the Australian guy because she says that she too would be deported because of it. I think that because of her fucked up past and family, she makes up these 'stories' (again, just a speculation right now) to make sure that I stay with her and keep on sympathizing with her. This is my first romantic relationship,don't know what to do, help!

Edit 1: She's also in contact with her abusive ex.

Edit 2: I love her, we have other issues but I think I got lucky with her. I know she loves me too and has done so much for me. She's shown me a happier future for myself, something I never could see before.

124,"I (28M) lost trust and interest in the relationship, but my partner (24F) is too invested and so badly wants to get married. Otherwise, it might affect her life adversely. What to do now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gez92f/i_28m_lost_trust_and_interest_in_the_relationship/,"*Whenever I talk about us, she always says that I only tell everyone one side of the story and that she has her own side and reasons. I never have denied that and when I ask her to tell her side, she would just storm out.*
So here is the disclaimer: This is only my part of the story and might not necessarily represent the whole story.   

I was a 28-year-old virgin when I installed the dating app called OKC. I am from India and my parents had started looking for a bride, which I wasn't so thrilled about, so I decided I 'll look out for someone actively. 28-year-old virgin isn't such a big deal here I guess, as I know a few friends who never had pre-marital sex.I had messaged to hundreds of people and a few had replied and one amongst them was this wonderful angel called XX. She had messaged that she was just looking for friends there, however, I was clear about my intentions with her. I had messaged that *I am cool with us being friends, but I was looking for relationship there.*   
We decided to meet for a Movie when Joker was released and we enjoyed the movie. After the movie, she said that her parents are not at home and that she has to go back to her relatives' home whom she isn't very thrilled about. So we decided to spend some time around, had lunch, walked in a park and then I suggested her to come to my home to watch the sunset as I live in a small penthouse (minus all the luxury part.)  Then when she mentioned that she would be going back to her relatives' home and that she isn't so happy about it, I asked her to stay back.

I  had my first kiss that night, though recently I learned that it wasn't a great experience for her. When we were lying close, I just moved closer and closer to her and when I was about to kiss her, I asked her whether can I kiss, which apparently broke all the buildup. :-/   

We started hanging out very often after that night, we made love that week and I was constantly in cloud nine. Things started moving pretty fast and in a month, we were head over heels!

However, I had lied to her about my past and had said that I had an ex-girlfriend and I had told her that I have had sex before. When I told her the truth, as we started seeing each other seriously, she was visibly upset and emphasized repeatedly that one shouldn't lie unnecessarily. However, she said that she might sometimes say a lie because she wouldn't want to discuss certain past events with anyone and assured me that such past events will not affect us in any way. It sounded very fair and I was so happy how forthcoming she was, which I never could be. I thanked her for being honest and told her that I would respect her past and she can tell me whenever she is comfortable, but I had demanded that if anything from the past continues to affect her present, she should be completely open with her.

Later after a week, she told me that her dad had committed suicide a few years back when she had started with college, and said that she would never want to discuss it again. I was so happy that she trusted me and told me such a traumatic event and I just started loving her even more. We started discussing our childhood, about how and where we grew up, etc. She had told me once that she had a boyfriend, but this time when I asked about her romantic life, she said she was in love with a guy who was her senior in the college and that there were many traumatic events in that which she doesn't want to discuss. She said that he used to leave her saying some bullshit reasons for a few days when she has slowly accepted it after a few days, he would come back to her and claim that he did it to make her stronger. Sounded pretty abusive to me, but I pressed for details about her sex life too. She said that she once had sex with him four years back and that was the only time she had sex before. Though I felt a little disappointed, I never thought of it as a big deal and forgot about it in a few days.  

Days passed, and we practically started living together. Since my place has hardly enough place for one, I suggested we stay at her place for a few days as they have a decent 2BHK apartment and her parents were in a distant land with XX's elder sister. On second day morning in her place, when I was leaving for work, I found that my bike's tyres were flattened and then some men came to me and started shouting and threatening in some language I didn't understand. They were speaking in Hindi, and when called my girlfriend down to the parking basement, I understood what was going on. Those people were her neighbours, commonly called as [Uncle/Unkil](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8pxtmf/what_is_an_unkil/), and they came to question and threaten me because I am some stranger who is taking advantage of a poor girl living near them. When she pleaded them to drop the matter, they raised their voice even more and wanted to call XX's mom and police (I have no idea why.) Somehow we managed to get out of there, and we formed an even closer bond with each other. That day, she pleaded with them saying that it was all her fault and responsibility and asked them to let me go. I just wanted to fight them and make them call the police, but she controlled me too and avoided a bigger scene. I was so moved by what she did and how she cared for me.   
Later, after a few days, she said that she has never let anyone else in her home when her parents aren't there and that I was too special, etc.   

She had earlier told me that she never had belief in marriage, but after that incident and when I found that what I mean to her, I got the full courage to ask her to marry me. She said that she would be happy to, as, for her, marriage is nothing more than a license that let her stay without me, without being questioned by her family and society. We started living as husband and wife, and she wanted to get married immediately. It was November and her family was planning to come back to town in December, so I just wanted to wait and then inform both of our family and then marry.
December came, her mom and elder sister came, and she started living with them, and we started seeing less of each other, however, we started video calling each other.  

Now let me break and tell something else. When she was living with me, two guys used to call her regularly and whenever they call, she used to get very upset, sullen and gloomy. When I pressed, she said they are her exes, one is the guy whom she was with for four years during college, and the other guy is whom she dated after college for a few months though she had known him from school. I had repeatedly advised her to cut off connection with them as she clearly didn't feel very good whenever they called. We had very long discussions about how one of them cheated on her and the other one continuously abused her for years.  

Cutting to mid-December, one evening I was missing her badly and asked her to come on a video call and for four hours, she maintained that she is talking to her sister and mom and that she will not be able to call me. After a few days, I *happen to stumble upon her google location history* and found that she was indeed outside somewhere till 11 PM that night when she claimed to have been talking to her sister, and that wasn't the only night. She then claimed that she had met her ex on one of the night because it was his birthday and he was very lonely and that she came back home by 8 PM. And on the second night when she was out late, she was with her sister. She cried and said that she will stop all communications with her exes and asked me to not leave her. I didn't have much ground to believe her, but I tried my best to believe her because I wanted to.

Days went on. I started pushing her to speak to her family and get a nod for our marriage and she started speaking to them every day about it with so much conviction. She did that for two months and by February, their family agreed, but my dad wasn't okay with it due to some stupid thing called caste. But something else was happening too.
In January, she started fighting for every small thing and started asking me to leave her. Those were some of the most traumatic weeks of my life as I was feeling like I was walking on glass shreds with bare feet. Every week, she would ask me to leave her at least three times; and I ended up begging her and running behind to make her stay. Sometimes, I would just leave my work and take the bike and go wherever she is, and maybe that's my second biggest mistake. Maybe one should let people go when they wanted to leave.

Then I found that she is still talking to her first ex, though she didn't send flirting or any such texts. But XX's ex kept on telling XX that she is responsible for his pain and sorrow and that he missed a lot of potential brides who wanted to marry him by paying a hefty dowry because of her and that his life is spoiled. (some fucked up shit) He tried to make her feel shitty and guilty and oh boy, he did succeed. Every time I found about her talking to him, she said some story or other, like once he asked money to pay for his college and she felt the need to help, and once he called from a different number and told someone in the family died or sometimes he messaged her on some weird way, such as a payment app and asked her to unblock him on WhatsApp etc. But every time she kept making the promises to me that she would stop talking to him and block him permanently, but that never seemed to be the case. I started checking her phone, her call logs, messages, her phone notification logs, etc. and every time I checked and caught her, she made the same promises and instead of keeping the promises, started covering her tracks. So, for example, once I confront her with notification logs, next time, that will be cleared and the same was the case with call history and on.
And one more thing, she always said that she never did anything wrong by letting her Ex talk to her or by her talking to them because ""she does not have any feeling towards them and there is nothing wrong in simply talking to a person and helping them when they need her."" I can understand such a strong feeling she has towards him. They got close at the time her dad died and she was very close to her dad. Maybe she found his company as something that kept her thoughts away from her dad's memories. XX's is the worst piece of shit I can imagine. When this poor girl was suffering from such a loss of her dear father, this bastard made her stop talking to her cousins who were trying to help a mourning kid by taking out to movies, shops, etc.

In March-end, when I found that she is still talking to him, I reached a breaking point one day and told her that we are breaking up, but when she cried, I called her ex to scold him and warn him. But when I called him, he started scolding me and her and said a slightly different story. Now, XX had told me that she broke up with this guy in 2017 and that she had sex with him only once long back and that she never let anyone in her home etc. But when XX's ex started speaking and shouting on the phone, I somehow managed to extract more and more information from him.
If I were to believe him, though she said that she didn't want to date him anymore in 2017, they were regularly seeing each other till December and sleeping together regularly and he also said that he had been to her home just a month before I and XX met and that incident with her neighbours occurred.XX was so angry and worried that I talked to her ex, and started telling me to leave. She called her ex and I guess she just scolded him for saying things to me.
I didn't want to believe whatever her ex said, so I told her something like: ""Baby, don't worry. If you are okay, we can get married right away. I know that he is very manipulative and he lies so often. I don't want to believe him. Moreover, those are your past and you didn't cheat on anyone. It was all before we met. And you had always said that you never felt wrong talking to him, so you did not do anything wrong in your own right. blah blah blah.""
But I wasn't able to take my mind off from those thoughts that she probably lied to me about her past. I asked her whether she actually just slept with him once, etc. which made her very upset. She started crying etc, but I was feeling distant. So I saw a shrink (via video call due to this pandemic) who suggested a couples' session.
In that session, when I told that I am looking for answers and that she broke promises, the therapist asked her, ""XX, OP has some trust issues. Do you want to say your side? What do you want to tell him to help him trust you?"" At this point, XX dropped off from the video call. So I called XX back after the session. She wanted to break up for a few minutes, but then after that, she started saying: "" *if you had these questions in mind, why did you give me the false hope a few days back? This is an emotional roller coaster. You gave me some hope, and now taking everything away. Moreover, you know about my relationship with my mom, and how hard I struggled every day to convince them for this marriage. Now they are just waiting for me to get married so that they can get rid of me. Now think about that too. If you were gonna do this, why did you force me to talk to my family? Every men are same. Why can't you love me for who I am? This is just like my previous relationship. Men will like if they see the good side, but once they see the other side, they will want to leave. Now that my family is waiting to get me married, let us get married and after a year, if you want, we can divorce.* ""


 Well, that day I was so adamant to leave, but after listening to her cry for about 12 hours, we decided to give it another try. Well, then after that we were trying. I couldn't get those thoughts out of my head, but I started ignoring those.

We again had some fight. Same shit. She even hurt herself this time. She hit her badly and cut her a bit. She wanted to die and she was feeling suicidal again. I just couldn't leave, though I tried very hard. We decided to try again.


Then one day, I was just teasing her about whether she has watched any porn ever, and she was maintaining that she never did. But I was doubtful, so I asked her to show the history. She refused. Then later that night, for downloading some large files via p2p network, I asked her to install qbittorrent, and *she had shared the screen* so that I can help her to add the torrent files and guide her through installation. She was sceptical to run the installer as windows had warned her against the file as potential malware, so I asked her to open the history to see the website she downloaded the installer file from. She was so adamant and told me to guide her on downloading the installer again. Then I thought something is fishy. We have shared each others' google password a while back, so I logged in to check the activity.  I did found a couple of instances of porn, but I just couldn't control but laugh. Then I also noticed that she has been visiting her Exes' social media profiles. So I said nothing. I just mentioned to her that we can see our google activity and find what sites we have been visiting.
In an hour, she deleted all the entries of stalking (and porn too.) Then I just couldn't believe that she still had to stalk them and take steps to hide those from me. When I confronted, she gave some stories as usual. We had a huge fight and then in the morning when I saw, she had already installed OKC. Since then we have activated two-factor authentication for our google accounts and I don't know what she is up to these days. But we do stay on video call with each other for most of the time every day, as we are now just stuck in our homes.
So last week, I was feeling bad and apologised to her profusely for asking whether she lied about having not slept with her Ex after they broke up and not inviting her ex to home just a month before we met. She got angry that time, but after several hours, she said that: *A month before she met me, since she stayed alone when she fell ill, she didn't know whom else to call and hence has called her Ex. When he came with medicines, he told her apparently that he is hard and unless he has sex, it won't go and it will be too uncomfortable for him and that it will start to pain. So she helped him and out and had sex.*  (Sound like he tried the classic porn movie plot and it worked for him!!! Whhat the actual fuck!!s)

------------

Anyway, I am not very sure if she loves me any more the way she used to.
She used to say I love you.
She used to call me baby.
Then it became dude.
Now, it is nothing. Just plain cold messaging.
But she keeps asking me every time whether I will marry her or not.
She so badly wants us to get married as soon as possible.

The reason I believe that she wants to marry me is not only that she loves me. Maybe she is just too worried about how she will handle her mom. Maybe XX is too invested in this relationship. Since she struggled a lot to convince her family, maybe she is afraid to go back and tell them that we had broken up and maybe that's why she is wanting to marry me?   

And though I want to believe and I almost know that she hasn't stalked her exes or contacted them in the last week, I don't know for sure. How could I? Every time I was sure in the past, I was proved wrong.  

Every time she comes online on WhatsApp, I wonder whom she is talking to. And I stay online often just to see, nowadays. And I even started trying to flirt with other people (though that was only for a couple of days out of spite). I started having some weird questions, such as ""If she had sex with him just a few months before, how dare did she to let me have unprotected sex with her? What if I got some STD such as AIDS from her Ex?""

------------

Anyway, now I promised her that I will marry her. But my mind says that if I marry her, I will spoil her life and that she deserves someone who can love her with all his heart.

But I cannot leave her too. All her neighbours and her family knows me, and in this country, that means, it will be impossible for her to find a groom. And I am really afraid that she will hurt herself again and might even do something stupid if I tell her I do not want to get married.



I don't know what I should do. :-/



If there is a way that I could work on my trust issues and these stupid questions in mind, and if I can just love her, there can be nothing like that. But as every day passes, I am losing hope. She still calls me regularly and spends time with me, but I always keep noticing some small things and I am just not being the person she deserves, lately.

125,My Family is Driving Me Crazy and I Don’t Know What to Do,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gmeioc/my_family_is_driving_me_crazy_and_i_dont_know/,"Hi so as read by the title, my family is absolutely driving me up the wall. And since the COVID-19 outbreak and all the isolation, it’s been making it a lot worse.

Here’s a little background:

My family consists of all Indians. My mom moved from India while all my siblings and I were born in the US. I (F19) live with my mom (M), my second eldest sister (SE) and my little brother (B). I have another older sister (OS) but she lives on her own. Lucky me, I’m a middle child that has depression and anxiety.

So here’s the situation, my family, when all of us were much younger, have been physically abusive. M would take out her anger on all of us. OS would do it to my other SE, me and B. SE would do it to me and B. I would do it to B and B to me. And if you’re thinking it’s just little quarrels, it wasn’t. It was full blown beating. My OS has actually taken each other my other siblings’ heads and mind and smashed it hard against the wall. And if we started to cry then she would hit us more and tell us to shut up otherwise she’d do worse. I’m not saying that what we did was right or that I’m proud of it, definitely far from it, but we’ve come a bit of a way to stop the physical abuse. And OS has come a long way and is a lot nicer than before. 

However, everyone has been, and still very are, emotionally abusive. Ever since I could remember my mom and siblings would call me fat, stupid, dumbass, retard, etc. And it just made it a lot worse that I had bullies at school doing and saying somewhat of the same things. Everyday it’s something or the other.

I have one thing though that absolutely ticks me off. Don’t touch me. When I was little, I was molested by someone I trusted for two years straight and I haven’t told anyone in my family about it. Hence the reason I don’t like been touched at all. Right now SE keeps grazing by me and pushing me with her body. Every time I tell her to stop she just starts laughing and goes “Oh, want me to do it again?” or “Stop being a baby” or something else to get me even more angry.

I yell at her to stop and M ends up yelling at me to stop arguing and yelling. M now has been yelling about me not leaving my room at all or doing anything around the house (I got laid off because of the pandemic). The whole reason I stay in my room (which I also share with SE) is so I don’t have to deal with any of them.

B hasn’t been too annoying just the occasional poking me but not too much.

The hardest part of this is it’s current Ramadan or the month of fast for Muslims. And my family all classify as Muslim (I don’t, I classify as Agnostic). I just don’t care for religion at all whatsoever. I’m so done with being forced to pray and do things for something I don’t really believe in. If you don’t know, Muslims have to pray 5 times a day so being home and not having anything else to do, I can’t avoid it.

Some of you might be wondering “it’s just praying, it doesn’t take that long, just do it and get it over with”. I do and it’s really getting to my head because what’s the point at all when I don’t even believe in it. I mean how would you feel if you were of a certain religion and someone forces to the pray as another?

But anyways, I really wanna ask what I should do, I’ve voiced my concerns and no one’s listening. Considering my depression, it’s been getting worse and I’ve been having major self harming thoughts again.

126,Am I in an abusive relationship?,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gdsijt/am_i_in_an_abusive_relationship/,"My girlfriend (20 F) and I (20 M) have been dating for about a year and a half now. We both study at the same college and that's where we met as freshman.

So initially when we started dating, she told me this event that happened in her past that caused her to not be quite outgoing. But, when she came to college, she found a nice group of people to call her friends. 

As time passed, she had differences with her group and eventually seperated from them. Eventually it reached a point where I was the only person whom she talked with. I was still being myself and hanging out with my friends and I'd spend some time with her in the evening.

One day she just bursts out crying and I'm trying to understand why, when she says that she's all alone and that I wouldn't understand because I have other friends. So I suggested that if she didn't like her old friends and that their differences couldn't be put aside that there were a lot of good people with whom she'd feel pretty comfortable. She just asked me not to interfere with her stuff. Eventually, I left it to her as I felt she wasn't comfortable talking about it.

A few months later, we were supposed to go home for our internship break and both of us were busy with our work. I'd call her at the end of each day hoping we'd talk like we'd used to in college. I'd start a conversation and she'd just say that she's tired or sleepy and just reply with ""Hmmmm"" whenever I was saying something. This went on for about a month. I thought it was just a phase that she's probably struggling with feeling alone and I asked if she needed to talk or needed my help. She declined and asked me not to interfere with her ""issues"".

In college there was a period of time where I got really busy with this event we were organising, and it was a national event, for which we prepared for like a week and half. I would often have to work late so couldn't see her as often. I'd make efforts to see her after class but she'd be tired and would just go up to her room. During the end of the week she started saying that I don't give her enough time and that my work was more important.

Since this whole lockdown (COVID-19 India) thing has begun, the same thing has been happening. She's never been to a therapist, although I did suggest it a number of times. During this lockdown, I've begun to notice that whenever I'm trying to have a conversation, she's trying to have an argument. She's quite condescending when we talk and doesn't contribute to the conversation at all. When I ask her if something is wrong, she'll brush it off with ""nothing"". At first I thought I was doing something wrong and that it was all somehow my fault.

I am slightly an introvert, so all these social media platforms kinda don't always make sense to me and used to prefer to keep my life off of social media platforms. It was my friend's birthday recently and I'm trying to become more active on social media, so I posted a story wishing him a happy birthday. She immediately responded by asking me why her birthday story was on my close friends list instead of on my normal story. She also followed it by saying that she's not jealous and that she was ""genuinely curious"".

But lately, even though I try to be as supportive of her mental illness as possible, she still is very condescending and keeps using her mental illness to justify this behaviour. A few of days ago, I said ""I love you"" and waited for a response. She didn't say it back. When I asked her about it, she said that ""I'm not comfortable saying it"" even though she's said it almost everyday before. She hasn't said it since then, even though we talk every day.

127,My husband thinks I waste things all the time....,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g9c2ch/my_husband_thinks_i_waste_things_all_the_time/,"Hey guys, I'm really confused and I'd love another opinion. 

Not sure if I should give some quick background? My husband (38M) and I (34F) have a really good relationship and are open to talking to each other about things to resolve issues. We do this regularly, we approach disagreements from the standpoint that we are a team want the best for each other. We've been married almost a year. He is from India and has lived in US for almost 10 years, where we live now.  I have been in bad and abusive relationships in the past and have been working *really* hard at being healthy, and he's been really supportive and overall things are awesome. 

\---

I ate lunch today and left some condiments on my plate. He had eaten previously, but entered the room when I was finishing my meal. He asked me why I took so much achar (a pickled condiment). ""I thought I wanted it, but I didn't."" I shrugged, thinking nothing of it. 

And here's where it begins: ""You waste so many things."" Was that his exact wording? Hard to say, I know he didn't use the words 'always' or 'everything'. 

\[I almost didn't include this, but in the interest of honestly, I said something sarcastic here. He tried to change the situation and asked what I was watching on TV. I said I was just wasting my time like everything else. Yeah, that was pretty passive aggressive and not cool, I know. He grabbed his plate of fruit we were sharing, yelled something and stormed out of the room. He brought the fruit plate when he joined me after my meal. He came back 20 mins later, apologetic for his behavior, and the conversation continued, more or less as follows.\]

""What do you mean, its only achar, its only a little bit and we've had it forever and neither of us eat it."" 

""Its so many other things, I don't want to get into it, but you should be mindful of these things."" After some bewildered questioning on my part, he gave another example. ""You leave butter on the knife after putting it on bread."" He tells me that I should wipe the remaining butter off the knife with my finger. Of course this would also apply to peanut butter, jelly, and the like. 

I think this is silly. and tell him so, expecting it to end there. Lets agree to disagree, its a tiny thing.  
Nope. 

Remember we just participated in this marriage seminar by a couple we mutually respect, and they said that some things aren't worth discussing, we don't agree, but it doesn't really matter so why bother.   
Nope. ""That applies to things like where you want to put the furniture. Not to being wasteful.""

Ok then maybe it is about something else? Not just about butter on a knife?   
Nope. ""If I have some feedback I am going to tell you.""

At this point I am thinking he is being a bit anal. I'm wondering if he has some OCD.  I am wondering if it is cultural, like, ""typical American waste, when I was growing up we didn't waste a thing"". But that is a lot of speculation.  I tried to use these tools, ""what I understand is ...."" etc.  

He says I ""don't see a value in the things, when everything has a value."" Also its God's spiritual energy. 

So it seems to me there are certain things that would go along with that, ""is this an ongoing issue, does he think *I* am wasteful? If I am not seeing value in things, am I not being respectful? Am I being disrespectful to you, as the provider of said things? or God?"" I'm not upset, I'm calm, I am legitimately trying to understand where he is coming from and why this is a problem.

He storms off again, says that I always do this, make a big thing out of nothing, trying to put so many words in his mouth and coverings on the problem. I never take any criticism. Or something like that. 

I really don't know what to say, does he expect that I just accept and do whatever he says? I don't really know what the problem is, except that it isn't just pickle. I know that I made mistakes in this conversation also. I didn't get a chance to apologize for my sarcasm before he stormed off again.  I would really appreciate any insight because I am not sure if I am being reasonable. Like I mentioned before, I was in pretty terrible relationships before so I am more likely to accept all the blame for things, apologize and move on, but I don't think that not wiping butter off the knife before washing it is wasteful or caused by a lack of mindfulness. I think that's stupid. 

Please give me some advice on what happened and how to proceed. Also, if this post should be somewhere else or is too long I'm sorry, please advise.

Get cozy folks and get ready for a lot of context. 

So my little brother I’ll call D is a self-proclaimed stoner. He started smoking the weed while at high school, in one of the most prestigious international schools in Europe. He managed to graduate with ok grades and a lot of very high achieving friends. 

He is intelligent but he’s a man of simple pleasures and has never been much of a high achiever, he lacks curiosity and drive. At the dinner table after school, we would ask him, so how was your day? His reply was always ‘…good.’ We would have to dig to get anything else from him. Meanwhile, the rest of us would have  conversations about our lives and about science, current affairs, politics and occasionally arts and literature, he would listen but wasn’t one to have an opinion or really engage by asking us any questions. 

For context: This is very unlike the rest of my family and extended family. My older brother and my father, who are both highly intellectual high achievers, and my mother, who can hold her own in any conversation and is interested in learning new things. I myself have always been very curious about all kinds of stuff, love discussing ideas and now have a fulfilling career. 

D did develop a few interests while at school which have not changed since graduating university: weed, drinking, football, board games/videogames and french rap, ( he listens to this exclusively,) which he identifies a lot with because I guess he feels very different from us, angry and misunderstood. Anyway, I tried showing him all kinds of music as he grew up and didn’t seem all that phased by it. 

D is usually charming and funny and a nice guy to be around but he’s never been very passionate or excited about a subject at school and was he type of kid that cared more about being popular and making girls laugh than getting involved in class.  His mentality is often focused on what the bare minimum he needs to do to pass would be. 

His communication skills are rather poor in the sense that he’s not very communicative about how he feels, what he does, or what bothering him, and feels cornered when we ask him anything. He also never tells us about any of his interests, but this might be because he knows we can’t relate to french rap and belated teenage angst. 

He was the class clown and became fairly popular in schoo… but when it comes to what he wants to do with his life.. he’s never had a very strong voice guiding him anywhere until he worked for a charity in India, and started liking the idea of working in developing countries. He does have a big heart and enjoys travelling so he figured why not?

He graduated in 2019 from a university in a different european country than the one he grew up in (we all live here now)… he disliked the studying, smoked weed constantly and had a harder time making friends due to the culture clash and his maybe some language barriers as its not his dominant language. (We all speak three languages as we’ve moved around a lot as a family but he’s definitely a lot more fluid speaking in one over the others)  Last september he moved back in with my parents and I. 

I really REALLY never expected that he would smoke while living with us… I would be so ashamed to smoke under my parents roof (you’d get it if you met them, they’re very ‘dignified’ people) and they’ve always run a tight ship. But the situation has been a huge problem ever since he moved in. He started smoking in his room, out the window, nightly. Then my parents found out and said he couldn’t smoke under their roof, so he started going for walks and smoking. At first just in the evenings after he thought they’d gone to sleep.

SIDE NOTE: You might think, what’s the big deal? The kid smokes some weed. I won’t speak for my parents as they have their reasons (they worry its a gateway drug amongst other things) but for me, personally, I do not trust the weed in London. Its like 99.99% skunk weed… and I’ve been reading online about the latest research and skunk really fucks with your brain. It has a huge neurological impact which, if abused the way he abuses it, could lead to long term damage. It also increases your chances of developing psychosis by a lot… 

It also serves as a massive crutch for him - he doesn’t deal with problems (clearly he’s got some deep seated shit he doesn’t know how to deal with) he just smokes and doesn’t have to feel inadequate or stressed or anything. 

My other reason for being against it is because I’ve been there - I was dependent on it for about 4 months at university, smoking daily and I remember how much it fucked with my motivation, short term memory, my mood, and it made me develop a extremely lame stoner sense of humour which is only funny to other stoners. 

&#x200B;

Since realising how hard getting a good job is (cause it requires, you know, effort and developed communication skills) and ESPECIALLY after lockdown, he’s been going out to smoke at least 3 fat blunts of extremely strong weed (I know because I took like 4 tokes one night and got uncomfortably high) every day. So at this point in the story he is either cranky and withdrawn from coming off it or very stoned. 

A little side note: he defends his smoking by saying its his ‘lifestyle’ that its ‘legal in many countries’ and that he doesn’t have any negative reactions to it. Because he’s so uncommunicative its hard to tell if he’s self-aware, in touch with his emotions and if he actually believes this. He is extremely stubborn and doesn’t want to believe anything we say because my parents ‘havent even tried it so how would they know’ and I’m ‘a woman with hormones so I reacted to it completely differently than he does’ 

Living with him started becoming extremely tense because of his constant mood swings, rudeness, lack of communication and his laziness and all our constant worrying. At the dinner table he looks down miserably at his food and hardly speaks and feels cornered if we ask him stuff.  Now we don’t ask him anything or try to involve him in any conversation. Meanwhile, my father is the sole breadwinner (I don’t have a job because of covid) and D is unenthusiastically completing programming courses online without ever telling us what his game plan is when the economy reopens. 

He basically eats with us but gets up and leaves straight after. Also, we live in a small apartment with parents who are 60+ and his constant coming and going put us on edge for months as he kept forgetting to wash his hands. He keeps getting pissed off that we keep ’telling him how to live’ for reminding him to take basic precautions. This led to A LOT of fighting. He basically rages with everyone demanding privacy and its been a bitch getting him to pull his own weight around the house. 

This all came to a head one day about a month ago when he physically pushed my mom out of his room one day when she came in to talk to him. My father put his foot down and told him that if he didn’t quit smoking, he had to go (yes, in the middle of quarantine) This finally shook him - He has managed to bring it down to one joint or two in the evenings again… and he’s somewhat on thin ice as he’s supposed to have quit if he wants to stay but as his behaviour has improved, my dad is cutting him some slack. 

&#x200B;

ANYWAY THIS BRINGS US TO LAST NIGHT, when I walked in on him rolling a joint. He looked at me and said “This is my last one. I’ve run out of weed anyway.” I told him, ok, how about you start smaller and quit for a week? He said ok. I was like, cool, so you promise you’ll quit for a week? He said yes.

&#x200B;

Tonight, I heard his telltale sneak out of the door. I opened the window to my room and I called out: Hey so how about the promise? He started complaining that he would do it next week, that he had a bit of tobacco left he wanted to use.  I tried to be very delicate and soft with my tone, showing love and concern instead of frustration. Eventually I said something like,  what is your word worth if you can’t even keep a promise to yourself? That did make him stop and deflate and think. He sat down against the wall outside to think and became withdrawn. I tried to convince him that the label he had given himself was just a label and that his cravings should go away in a few days if he stands firm in just trying to quit for at least a week. He said he’s felt cravings even after stopping for two weeks. He said that this is just who he is. But he said these things with all the giddy wind knocked out of his sails (I almost felt guilty he looked so lost)  

&#x200B;

I managed to coax him back up, by asking him to just try for one week to see if he can do it. He went straight to his room. I asked if I could come in, he said yes, and I told him I could help him if we wanted to talk, if he wanted to come up with an action plan to try learning a new skill or something when the cravings hit. He just said no, its fine. 

&#x200B;

My issue is, I really want to help and support him but he doesn’t let me in (its especially hard now as we’re all sick of seeing each other in confinement) He’s always had a big chip on his shoulder about asking for help - he never wants it - he’s got this stupid ‘manhood’ thing where he thinks it makes him weak to depend on others. He never wants to talk - I dont think he knows how to ‘dig deep’ unless he’s high. But I don’t see how he can start to change if he can’t verbalise how he’s feeling, ever - because he’ll never be able to tackle the issues that he’s running away from. Most worrying of all, I think the reason he likes weed so much is that in ‘unlocks’ curiosity in him - something he doesn’t seem to feel much when he’s sober.

&#x200B;

What can I do to help him ? 

&#x200B;

129,Seeking any help or advice.,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gc1sjd/seeking_any_help_or_advice/,"Hello 

I am a 23yr old Indian female. Well atleast my parents did no. Of abortions to make sure only a boy was born. But then a point came, where doctor told them that they can't concieve again if they aborted me. So with no resort , they had to give birth to me.

My relatives from both the side are same. On one side, my father's side they are thug and earns money by illegally capturing lands of innocent and giving them death threats. On other hand my mother's family is highly educated, but with even worse mentality. They think girls have no right at all. They have even killed new born baby girls and thrown them in river as they are useless. Just marry at 17 or 18 itself and make babies.

My parents have been highly controlling. they want to decide everything for me, how I sit talk, think, eat , sleep. Basically be their puppet. They are so much caste-centric, that even if the opposite person is of the same religion, they will dig down deeper to find the caste, his/her hometown ( which also be the same as ours, same goes for gender) and only then he or she can be a friend. But that's just not possible in today's world. I have always been a topper in my class and have done internships at prestigious institute like IIT, and even gone abroad on my very first full time job role. But none of that makes them happy. They say they want me to have atleast 4 babies, and get me married. 

They have started looking for a guy. It doesn't even matter if he or she is earning less than 15,000 INR monthly, or is uneducated and have no schooling, they would marry me off for money and basically because I am an headache to them. And a bad omen in their life. On the other hand I am earning 5X the guys they are looking for me. 

My parents just crib about the past of how things happened here and there like 30 yrs ago and keep crying over the same thing. There hasn't been a day where I have smiled or be happy. They say all the bad things happening in their life is because of me. They blame anyone friend or colleague they know from my life out of home, saying the have manipulated me.

But unlike them I don't care for caste, religion, gender, whether the person drinks or smoke even if I don't. I work at ngo, leave away from them, have my own pets ( well they have problem with that as well) . They want me to give all my salary to them and they will decide where I should spend. Well I would be happy to do that but only if they stopped acting the way they are. 

I was 3 yr old when they threw me outside the house for not eating the last piece of food. I kept crying, but no one came to help me. It was thundering and raining the whole night, snakes passed beside me. I was so afraid. I still get that day in my nightmare. They have been trying to stop my studies from 5th grade it self. 

For the last 8 yrs when I moved out of home for my further studies after lots of fight at home, I have tried to keep everything of my life off the grid from them. But now they say they doubt I have a bf and I m trying to run away with him and some many things that I just can't write. In the mean time I have got certain genetic disorders, which they say because of my own sin of being a girl's and not being their puppet. They compare everything with money. They don't have a single friend of their own. Everywhere they go they get into fight with no particular reason. They hate every other religion to such an extent that they can be caught by police for spreading such hatred. 

All I want to do it study a bit more, get one more degree, travel to few places, not be a frog in a well who knows nothing about the outside world like them, help others and make my own decisions. How can someone who is educated and has a very forward thinking settle with guys like they are looking who are very narrow minded for them women is dustbin. Their family beat their wives to remove frustration from work or just for fun. I am not going to bear that i am independent. And I can take decision of my own. Giving birth to someone and actually becoming the child's parents is 2 different things. Like apple and oranges. 

If you don't do what they say, they will start abusing, this has led me to depression and reduced productivity. I have tried everything in the world to make them understand. They are even manipulate by relatives who have the same thinking about girl child. I understand, according to Indian society I should take care of them during old age, and I have no problem with that, but not like this. They say they will stay with me after marriage also. And decide how I should behave with my husband, and they will even decide my child's future, I apparently have no right to decide anything, I should be grateful that I am born. 


 I just want to go out of country, I am trying to get into a good college but that seems to be on hold due to on going pandemic in the world. the nearest possibility is next year. 

-I don't want to file a police complaint or anything, coz I think that might affect my college admission ( I am not sure please shed some light on this).

- I also want to know if they can legally call me back to India, once I move out.

130,Advice about trust/mutual friends (couple of 2.5+ yrs),https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fukmef/advice_about_trustmutual_friends_couple_of_25_yrs/,"Hi, 

I’m F[21] and have been a lot of resentment towards my partner about his habit of lying. He tends to lie about many things, both trivial and big matters, over a long period of time. For example, about almost a year into our relationship, I found out he went to a different college within the university in his first year and transferred in his second year. All along, he made jokes about how lame the other college is and left no hints that he went there. 

He tends to lie/hide his hang-outs with other female friends as well. We had many many long conversations (each conversation after a different hang-out with a different female friend). All these female friends are mutual friends with both and him so most of the time, we as a couple hang out together with that friend(s). However, when he hung out individually with them in settings that i found very uncomfortable with (dinner, lunch at restaurants with just two of them), he would not share that with me after. I would find out about it when I saw the other friend’s message (I would ask them what they did/were doing, then they said I just got lunch with David (changed my bf’s name)). Or I would see a picture in his camera roll and asked where it was and he would say it was from lunch with a female friend. Two of the female friends were, according to him, close friends, one of whom he had a slight crush on (always visits her when in town, she came over to his hotel room to meet/chat). One was from the same hometown, all 12 years of school, and at one point, they briefly dated (his camera roll was full of her snapchat pictures prior to meeting and dating me). The other two are my friends as well but older than me (same age with his). I mentioned many times with him that I’m comfortable with him hanging out with them but definitely not comfortable about him lying/hiding about it. I would appreciate transparency in making plans with people of opposite-sex, whether together or just him and then. It took him over a year to start being transparent about his and respected my feelings. But it kept happening again and somehow i found myself tirelessly re-explaining the rationale and my hurt feelings repeatedly. Sometime in these arguments, he would flatly refuse to stop lying/letting me know about these plans because he feels restricted if he has to do that. I would then reply that this is not restriction/lack of freedom, this is him respecting my personal boundaries. 

Another matter that he lies about was also conversations with his male friends, in which I think, are very much toxic masculinity content. He has many group chats with his Indian friends (he’s from India so I think, this background plays a part but again, I don’t want it to be an overgeneralization here). These group chat are named “gay boys”, which I found very uncomfortable with. At one point, I was added to the group chat and saw first hand, many jokes about races and women in general. For example, jokes/memes/remarks/comments about women go like this: Friend A: “make a sandwich for yourself”. My boyfriend would reply: “That’s a woman’s job.” Friend A would reply: “LOL”.  Another one about race can be black people or once, about my Asian “communist” identity which I just laughed it off, despite feeling weirded out. These group chats are very long (basically since high school) and active (new texts every day). I bet everyone is in a group chat but i find it very offensive when this kind of content is normalized and deemed “casual” and “chill”. I noticed that this kind of misogyny and toxic masculinity are also transferred into real life when my boyfriend makes jokes like these in real life and just “laughs it off” as well. 

The culmination of this was over this winter break in December. I went back home to Asia for 8 weeks and he went back home to India for 2 weeks, so we had a brief LDR. This break was traumatizing for me because he has long history of lack of communication (no expression of emotions, radio silence when supposed to be engaged in our talks about relationship, emotional numbness/freeze when I start being frustrated with his silence/lack of response). Things were fine over FaceTime until the day before Christmas, we got into a fight over FaceTime. He said that he would be online to talk to me at a certain time but he was very late and cancelled it last minute. This happened before in previous breaks and I told him that I’d appreciate a heads-up because of the time difference (my day is his night, vice versa). He would rarely do it and just drop me last minute, leaving me feel really surprised/offended in a way as if he doesn’t respect my time. This break, I personally was going through a lot of personal issues (family abuse between parents, feeling out of place back home, reverse culture shock, loss of the only group of close friends in hometown) so I didn’t have anyone to talk to throughout 8 weeks. From his side, he dropped the phone call and made me very mad so I yelled on the phone later on. Before going back home, he said that he would try his best but can’t guarantee because he’s only home for 2 weeks and wants to spend time with his family. I said, that’s ok but if last minute cancel, he needs to let me know because I’m going through a tough time and needs that call with him once every 2-3 days. So after he dropped the call, he disappeared for 5 days and left me super confused/mad. His family was going through a tough time as well. His mom was kicked out of the house by his grandparents and got involved in a lawsuit. They were looking for a new place. His dad and his mom were getting to the verge of divorce, they are separated too. His sister is going through a rowdy teenager phrase. I knew this before and kind of focused on just myself and my issues back home. 

He came back 5 days later and wrote me a long message saying that he was diagnosed with critical PTSD by a psychiatrist - he got into a panic attack in the car when he got into a fight with me. I called him and he picked up and crying. We had a very emotional talk about his childhood/ptsd from our relationship - i cried a lot and wrote things down on my notebook. However, a few days later, over the course of 8 weeks, his attitude completely changed to being very hostile towards me. He said he wants to break up and will break up, without explaining why. I was left knees-deep in depression and anger. I would call him so many times, texted him, and he would not reply at all. Radio-silence. This hurt me so much to a point that i would spend all nights crying (3 weeks) and slept in the morning. I texted his friends, mostrefused to hear me out because they don’t want to be in the middle. At one point i was so hurt and feeling abandoned with no one to talk to, i asked his friend if they can stop talking to him for a week so that he feels what he was making me go through. In response to this, everyone reacted negatively and told my boyfriend that I’m being very crazy, without even knowing what i was going through myself. Please note, this is the same group of male friends in the group chats above. One of them texted my bf and said: “block her everywhere, ignore her, she will come crying and email you, ignore that too - you’re definitely over her, stop giving a fuck”. This remark, which i found out on my own later on, hits me at my core because to me it’s treating very disposable and brings hints of toxic misogyny/belittling woman. The worst thing was that my bf replied: “yeah i guess”...

131,Get divorced or try to salvage,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g4bdd3/get_divorced_or_try_to_salvage/,"Sorry for this incredibly long post... I don't even know how to start, so I just started from the very beginning. I haven't spoken to anyone about this, except my wife, and I feel I am just damaging her and tearing away at the trust and love she had for me. Starting March 2019, I told her I didn't know if I really had loved her. I've told her 2 more times, late September 2019 and right before my match day, I was March 18 2020. These last two times came out as proclamations for divorce rather than just doubt and feeling uncertain. We have no kids, but I promised her a life of fulfilling her own grad school dreams and eventually having kids together... 

&#x200B;

I met my wife at McDonald's in Jacksonville, FL, our hometown. We were both 18, and both went to the University of North Florida. She was studying astrophysics and I was pre-med.  
Throughout the first couple of years I think things were great. We would study a lot together, watched similar shows, read similar books, had similar tastes of music.  
Around year 3, I started getting a lot of doubt, and I have never mentioned any of this doubt to her until last March. I did not know if I even still ""loved"" her, though I continued to say ""I love you"", though these words coming from my mouth would start to feel less and less genuine, as if I had to say it under a muttered breath or with a difficult swallow preceding it. Again, she didn't notice any of this, and has always said ""I love you"" to me several times a day and before bed, and it has always felt genuine from her.  
We have had moments lying in bed together throughout these  2-4 years where she would sit up and look me in the eyes and say ""what is it about me that you love? Why do you love me?"" I would not know how to answer. I would lock up and freeze, almost because I have been asking myself that same question... What is it that I ""love"" about you, do I even love you?..... I had never been with anyone else before, is this what love is supposed to feel like? Are there different gradients of love that exist on a spectrum, and I just don't know where my current relationship falls because I lack experience. Perhaps it could be better, perhaps it could be worse.  
I proposed to her after 4 years. Before the wedding, I would cry in my bed at night trying to go to sleep, thinking about how I just locked myself in to a relationship when I wasn't sure if I'd ever love anyone again... I kept telling myself ""this is what religious people do (I am not religious). This is what cultures do in the middle east and in India, they get arranged marriages and stay together, they're told to suck it up and deal with it. You'll learn to ""love"" her again...""  
 We were moving away to TN so that I could start medical school, and she would follow me there, committed to stay together for each other. ""We"" applied broadly together, and wound up choosing TN because there was a graduate school here where she can pursue astrophysics.... That never worked out. She ""mis-bubbled"" her Physics GRE and had an abominable score, and no longer pursued higher education.   
I guess I still feel some resentment for that, but I also feel apathetic about it. It is what it is. I've landed a fantastic residency and I did magnificent on my boards. Did I desire to be in rural TN? No. But I have to say they've provided me with a fantastic education and IDK if I'd change that!  
We traveled to Europe together and to Las Vegas together as part of our trips during the first 2 years of medical school (trust me, I had very little free time. This was during the summer).  I cried in Las Vegas from a petty fight about using a public bus. It was very bizarre, crying for hours that night, and it seemed odd and disproportionate to the inciting event. The truth is, it was from my ""doubt"" that just kept eating away at my thoughts. That night was ruined, and left her feeling perplexed. I've had many more fights with her during this time frame (years 5-7), and I get more and more enticed by the idea of just letting the relationship die and having us separate. I feel like I started getting passive aggressive with her, in hopes of her noticing that I am not happy, and she would be the one to feel disconnected, uncertain, and ready to serve me the papers rather than the other way around. To this day, I wonder if I would cry or feel sad if SHE was the one to hand me the papers. In my head, I imagine just being elated and saying ""about dang time, what a relief!"" But is that really what I want?   
Now since March of last year (which I wrote about in my previous message), I feel like my desires, doubt, and uncertainty are all just amplified. There is not a single day, not a single hour, where I don't think about this ""Are we really happy together? Am I happy together? Would I be happier single? Would I be happier with another partner?""  
It has gotten to the point where I fantasize about cheating on her in many different ways, or fantasize about her cheating on me, just so I can turn it around and have an excuse to leave her.  
Her parents recently got divorced, just in June 2019, she found out that her father had been cheating on her mom for the past 17 years. Her father did not express any remorse, and said he had been trying to leave her for years, and just did not want to ""hurt"" her mother emotionally. He said he has felt ""dead inside"" for years, and finally couldn't take it anymore and cheated on her, since he held nothing sacred in his relationship.  
I wonder if I relate to him to an extent, just fantasizing about cheating on her, finding a new love, or just severing our ties and ripping the band-aid ... This family divorce has been devastating for my wife, she doesn't even speak to her mother or father anymore,  she has been physically and emotionally abused by both of them for many years, up until she met me at age 18 in fact.  
For the last 2 years, I haven't even been able to say ""I love you"" anymore.  I feel this wave of nausea when I say it back to her, and feel like I am about to start crying. When we lie down together and I hold her, I don't feel the ""warmth"" i used to feel, its the same as holding a pillow, and it gives me so much distress and anxiety that I cannot fall asleep at times, and I turn and face the other way.  
The past 2 years, I have started to ask that she wear makeup again, even though we are doing nothing in the apartment and not going out. I have become severely unattracted to her without makeup in these last 2 years, which never really was an issue for me before.   
Now, since before match day, March 18 2020, I have been having waves of conflicting thoughts, and I wonder if they are genuine, or if they just emerge from the guilt from my last ""divorce"" talk with her. On a daily basis now, my opinion changes... I go to sleep uncertain and doubtful, I wake up sad and with the same feelings, but throughout the day I start feeling better and can imagine a future together. During this sudden change in heart, I want to invest in US together, I want to support her emotionally and want her in my life... But then it starts to die down at the end of the day, and I am hit with the uncertainty again, and the anxiety and doubtful thoughts return. 

I have read through her messages on her phone, and I already know its the wrong thing for me to do, an invasion of her privacy, but I almost feel apathetic about it. She has one great friend that has always been there for her in Jax. She has always been supportive of her, and tells her the right things: ""You need to leave while you can, don't have kids with this man, you deserve better, you deserve to be loved the way you love too, you shouldn't have to wear makeup in your own damn apartment, F\*ck this guy."" I read this and think ""I know deep down she is right, I think I should just rip this band-aid and end this relationship. She deserves better.""

  
Our sex life has always been great, she fulfills all of my sexual desires and I am obsessed with her body. We have sex multiple times a week...... Still, I imagine being with other women frequently, and will even fantasize about other women I know even right after having sex.  

 I guess I opened the floor with a little more background. Hope it wasn't too excessive, just wanted you to have the best and clearest understanding of what I've been going through.

132,Am I in a toxic relationship and am I a toxic person?,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fg8cz7/am_i_in_a_toxic_relationship_and_am_i_a_toxic/,"As the subject of this post suggest I am conflicted. I am not sure if I am a toxic person or if I'm just caught up in a toxic relationship that brings out the worst in me. I have been with my wife for all of seven years. We lived in for 4 years and are now married for three. From the very beginning, when we started dating, I noticed how she would get abusive and would make the most hurtful remarks about my ethinicity, family, where I was raised etc. This obviously would lead to me losing my top and giving it back to her with the same vengence and ferocity as was bestowed upon me. I know full well that what I did was wrong. However, what I soon realised was that she would take my reaction and turn it around on me and tell me I have anger issues that I need help and that this was all my fault. At first this only aggravated me further because...although I was willing to take responsibility for my actions, she continued to behave as if my actions were not justified. I am no Mahatama Gandhi to turn a cheek and let the person slap you on the other side, and that may be my fault. During these years of living in together we she has always been the one to start hurling caustic and personal remarks on me, my family and everything else in between. I am okay with using abuses because that's just how we speak when we are angry but the creativity and information that is used to say the sickest most disturbing things to a person is where I draw the line. And that line doesn't seem to exist with her. I always had my doubts about marrying her but then...we lived in together for 3 years and I eventually felt like I wouldn't find anyone better...that I have invested so much time and effort in this relationship that it would be best to go ahead with things and maybe the relationship would see a change after we married. It's not like I didn't love her. I was just scared that it would end up in a divorce with the way things were and decided to not tie the knot as quickly as I had earlier expected. The time we were living in was not just one with verbal abuse but physical abuse as well. She would raise her hand on me and throw shit at me and I would react. I would hit back, although not as hard as she would but I couldn't help it but to fight back. Was I wrong in doing so...I know I was. Was I wrong in fighting back I don't personally think so. Have I had this issue in any of my multiple other relationships? Not once! Physical violence never! Abuses to this extent...never. Am I guilty of my actions...Yes! Did I apologise...Yes! Could I forget...NO! 

Cut to chase and three years being married...I live in a diffrent city and she lives in her hometown. We moved there after getting married because she wanted to be closer to her single father. But I was on the verge of losing my job and got my salary infrequently so I decided to look for a better opportunity and found one in the city that we originally met. She refused to come along. I've been here now for a year and travel to see her every fortnight. Did the relationship improve while we were in the same city...not one bit. The fights the violence the abuses just never stopped. Everything was as it was. I personally came around a little because she said she needed love, more of it and I did give it. Maybe not in the language she wanted it but in the way and form that I knew best. But any argument we had would erupt into a shit storm of violence and abuses. By now anyone reading this sees the trend. Anyway...moving apart and staying in different cities seemed to have helped because in the last year the arguments the fights, or should I say dirty fights have seen an all time low. But yesterday we were having a debate and it got heated...she started yelling in public...and the topic was a taboo topic on religion and I was afraid her hateful remarks would find someone of that faith and it really annoyed the hell out of me. I repeatedly asked her to not say that so loud and that there were people around us...but to no avail. So in my anger I called her a third rate woman...and in response she spat in my face. That was my tipping point...I should have slapped her hard across the face for doing that but I didn't and went back home and left the house. I returned a few hours later (I don't drink or smoke pot or use any other narcotics) and she pretended like everything was okay. I wanted my space and didn't want to talk but she wouldn't let go...and then when I didn't concede to thing being okay she went on a diatribe of abuses and hateful remarks etc. All through this I was being a mute. I did not want to lose my cool or flip out because of the shit she was saying. So she slapped me. That was it...I packed up my bag and flew back and left home to go back to the city I live in. While at the airport I was threatened of the consequences of me leaving the house (I've done that before in my anger) that if I left she would divorce me. And she has now decided to divorce me and that's all she is saying. 

I'm not sure what to do...what is happening here...where am I to go if this actually goes through. Am I a toxic person. She says I have anger issues. I need help from some one anyone who can understand me. I am not saying I am an angel but am I to belive her. I am very depressed. It's a festival for us here in India and well...here I am!

133,When is a good time to tell your parents about a relationship?,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fxd3a8/when_is_a_good_time_to_tell_your_parents_about_a/,"I’ve been with my boyfriend (an international student from India) for almost 6 months now and none of our parents know about it. We’re both studying in the same university right now in the US.

For me, I kind of gave my mom an intro two mons ago about how we’re getting really really close. But in my case, my parents are physically and emotionally abusive/manipulative and I know that they will use this information against me and blacklist me with it in a lot of ways if I tell them about my boyfriend. So my plan is to tell them bits by bits and pretend everything is not that serious and that I’m not that attached. 

In my boyfriend’s case, his family is very loving and caring (I believe they’re pretty open minded too from the details my boyfriend have told me. Plus some of his cousins are dating too and they’re parents seems to be completely okay with it). 

But after his aunt (who’s taking care of him at the moment in US) told him that “relationship in school will never work”, he became very concerned about what his father might say and just decided not to tell them at all right now. My boyfriend trusts his parents and he knows that if his parents says to cut ties completely, he’ll do it because he’s family oriented, that’s why he keeps stalling. It makes sense not to tell them, but at the same time, I don’t want anything to snow ball and explode at the end. The cons and pros are 50/50 so I really don’t know what to do. 

I know that sooner or later we both have to tell our parents at some point so I want to ask in a situation like this when is the best time to let our parents know? 

I’ve talked to one or two redditors and they both suggested that for my boyfriend, he should tell his parents about it when we’re graduated or when the studies are done.

134,"Emotionally Abusive Relationship !! I keep going back to, only to realise how bad it is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gnyh9h/emotionally_abusive_relationship_i_keep_going/,"Me (27M) and my gf (I guess now my ex) (21F) have been together for more than 18 months now. We both met on Instagram and realised we both liked each other and loved speaking to each other and then for the first few days of our friendship spoke on call for days at length. I met her and her friends, and soon enough started hanging out daily. Getting drunk, partying, and what not. That was all good.

She had just came out of an emotionally and physically abusive relationship with a guy, well just say the kinda person you don't want around you. Which was surprising given she belonged to such great family, great parents and siblings. The guy was a street side Romeo who cheated on her countless times. She has similar friends who all belong is such failing relationships full of abuse and cheating.

I had just got out of a 5 year long relationship with a long term friend of mine because of the pressure of getting married (from her family) the marrying part wasn't the problem but the check list was, of how much I should be earning, how big my own house should be, and how expensive the wedding should be. it all felt too material all of this while she looked down passively on what I did and where I belonged from (we both belonged to different caste, India, so you can understand how important this is here) and built up a lot of pressure on me and I had to get out of it.

Anyways back to the current scenario. So my gf started of this relationship being emotionally unavailable and wouldn't tell anyone about us, which felt weird because she would entertain a lot of. guys. Speaking to them is not a problem but letting them flirt and ask her out and never actually mentioning me was kinda the issue, but that was still fine. we got around that, then we slept together for the first time, and things just changed for us. she was way too emotionally committed in the relationship which made me feel so good, and we got a lot closer after that. Slowly she started being paranoid about the people in my life, so she demanded for my social media passwords so that she felt secure, which she used to get rid of all the female population from them. Some of them were very old friends of mine who all knew about her. When we had fights she would start reacting in a very bad manner, speak in a very dissrespective tone was a first for me, I had 3 relationships before this, none involved me abusing my gf. This was something I felt she picked up from the guy she dated and her friends, who all spoke and fought like that.

After the first few times, I started losing my cool and started abusing every time she would act all crazy and treat me bad, which had never happened before in all my past relationships.

Anyways, so she made sure I had no new or old female friends that I spoke to. she demanded all of my time, wanted to constantly be on call, even while she was showering or working or speaking to her family. The first few months I let this go, but it made me really uncomfortable later on. She had a problem with me speaking to others while the call was on, even if they were my cousins (Indian Joint Family). She had a problem with my job as I had to go out for meetings with my female boss. She even had a problem with a guy boss I have. She would randomly just call me a cheat for no reason what so ever. When I told her this has nothing to do with me and because of your past trauma she would get mad and say ki no because I am a cheater, then she would tell me how good her sisters guy is and all ( her sister doesn't act all crazy with him first of all). She never accepts her fault and feels that I treat her bad, and that I am not putting enough efforts. I have distanced myself from all my friends, I have started locking my room so my cousins are not around when I am on call with her, I have zero female friends which is not that big a deal but shouldn't be a requirement. Btw, she still has her old male friends around, whom she speaks to regularly.

Recently I told her that lets not be on call 24/7, I am not much of a call person (I said this because she would fight when I would be on call with her, which is not always possible), and this apparently hurt her, and she since then started acting like all crazy, one word replies and lack of interest. All of this has pushed me to the edge.

I don't wanna just blame her for everything, what has happened now is that every time she provokes me or speaks to me disrespectfully I lose my mind and I abuse her, and I say hurtful things in return, I obviously end up over doing it. And then I am the one apologising only for her to act more pricey. We had such a fight recently and I told her its not worth it, that I am sorry for what I said but I don't wanna fix this relationship again.

Worst of all, her parents (mom) doesn't see the wrong In her. When told that her daughter is way too insecure and keeps doubting me all the time, she said its normal for this to happen, that my gf's father used to doubt her mom too.

I know this is a long long post, but I have so much frustration within me, and I am so angry all the time recently, my productivity has gone to the dogs, my family life, friends, emotional life all has gotten ruined. Its like I had to do everything thinking twice about the consequences.

Most importantly she made me give up non vegetarian food because it was against her beliefs.

Help Out.

135,Girlfriend of 7 years abruptly broke up,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/g01ayn/girlfriend_of_7_years_abruptly_broke_up/,"So me and my girlfriend( both 27)  have a really complicated dynamics in our relationship. We have been dating for 7 years and have been friends for 9.

She has been in United States for 3 years and I am india, we have been managing to meet only for 3-4 weeks a year... We facetime and talk to each other during the mornings and nights and do try to be in touch as much as possible. 

About my girlfriend.. she lives in US and doesn't have a social group just one or two friends in the city she lives and bunch of friends in different parts from her grad school. Back in 2018-2019 she suffered from severe depression, back tracking it; the origin of it was loneliness clubbed with this immense phobia of doctors. 
She all in her life has had fear of doctors which came from a traumatic childhood experience with a doctor and pain management. On top of it she is a single child with a father who is bipolar himself. He and his wife had a sour relationship all their life and had been verbally abusive and inconsiderate to her daughter as well.


This incessant fear has been magnified as she aged and lived alone.Meeting psychiatrist and dentist just made her realise that the fear is mammoth. In last few months she has been better with her depression, has been off her medicines as well but this doctors fear has come on the surface. 

In last few months we started talking about the future. I have a plan to be in United States this fall for grad school and we made plans to be together in the weekends and eventually she would move once I find a job after 1.5 years of school. We both have been really upbeat that we would graduate from major long-distance to a smaller one. In all this discussion I talked about kids and family that maybe like in 4-5 years we can have kids and get married maybe in like 2 years.  In all the 7 years of dating and 9 years of our friendship I know that she wants to have kids but yes she is super scared of doctors and pain etc. 

In last few of our discussions she has said that maybe surrogacy or adoption could be a possibility which to be honest I shunned since I can't imagine that yet, not atleast without trying personally, not atleast we had year of therapy for her doctors phobia and all that fails. 

After this recent conversation about family and kids, clubbed with whole COVID 19 isolation and both of us mentally exhausted( isolation, worry that might not come to US at the first place and complete lockdown) she told me she can't be with me as she knows that she can't overcome her fear. I told her that we don't need to think now and take it short term and then we can try therapy and take it slow and then see.. 

But she has been adamant that she will not have kids, maybe she doesn't want them at all( which I believe is lie) and I should not be with someone who might die because she can't call the doctor. 


So this is the situation. I can't reach out to her, I don't know how to approach her. The whole conversation from fear of doctors has come to you want kids and I don't want them. 

I have tried to say that I love her not the future that might or might now be there and trying to text her and call her but I am not able to connect. 

I also in back of my mind have this confusion that how will I work this out. She is not optimistic, I don't know if she will do therapy and all this is almost next to impossible to deal over phone. 


TL;DR - How to deal with girlfriend who been disconnected with me, has depression and immense doctors phobia and I can't approach her since she is in US and me in India.

136,Am In a toxic relationship and am I a toxic person,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fg8j2d/am_in_a_toxic_relationship_and_am_i_a_toxic_person/,"As the subject of this post suggest I am conflicted. I am not sure if I am a toxic person or if I'm just caught up in a toxic relationship that brings out the worst in me. I have been with my wife for all of seven years. We lived in for 4 years and are now married for three. From the very beginning, when we started dating, I noticed how she would get abusive and would make the most hurtful remarks about my ethinicity, family, where I was raised etc. This obviously would lead to me losing my top and giving it back to her with the same vengence and ferocity as was bestowed upon me. I know full well that what I did was wrong. However, what I soon realised was that she would take my reaction and turn it around on me and tell me I have anger issues that I need help and that this was all my fault. At first this only aggravated me further because...although I was willing to take responsibility for my actions, she continued to behave as if my actions were not justified. I am no Mahatama Gandhi to turn a cheek and let the person slap you on the other side, and that may be my fault. During these years of living in together we she has always been the one to start hurling caustic and personal remarks on me, my family and everything else in between. I am okay with using abuses because that's just how we speak when we are angry but the creativity and information that is used to say the sickest most disturbing things to a person is where I draw the line. And that line doesn't seem to exist with her. I always had my doubts about marrying her but then...we lived in together for 3 years and I eventually felt like I wouldn't find anyone better...that I have invested so much time and effort in this relationship that it would be best to go ahead with things and maybe the relationship would see a change after we married.

137,Stuck in a situation that drained me out to a pulp: how do I start all over? How do I get a degree?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gluvea/stuck_in_a_situation_that_drained_me_out_to_a/,"**serious**

I'm a 19 year assigned female at birth person from India. This should explain my situation a bit, that I'm a queer.  

It all started when  it was clear my dad took too many debts. We had to sell our house at marginal rate to pay off the debtor, I was 9ish back then. My mom started working more and my dad became drunker and drunker, lying constantly about his whereabouts. At this point I was solely with my grandma, the only person who cared about my wishes. My parents being Asians were busy trying to force their ""ideal daughter"" bs down my throat and wanted me to be a lawyer like my dad.  Especially when it was clear I was a supposedly ""genius"" Kid.  

Here is the drill: I used to hate school. I was always bullied for one reason or the other, especially by the teachers because I asked to many questions. After my grandma's death things escalated and loneliness plunged me into Great Depression. I was 13, and since one year back my neighbor started sexually abusing me each chance he got.  I was so scared that most of the time I would freeze and vomit after he was done.  Since my parents were barely home (my mom worked hard to bring food to the table and pay for school) it became easier for him to target me. 

Knowing the financial constraints, I started looking for jobs. I found some freelancing shitty article writing website where I worked for a year before finding some other job.  I had to juggle school life, my own failing health, my mental health, extra tuition classes and my abusive drunk dad who Kept cheating on my mom (and didn't pay for my hospital bill) and my mind was getting hazy.  

There were days where I feel into panic attack at the thought of going to school . My mom took me to psychologist at the government hospital because I wasn't ""studying"".  She wasn't good but talking helped a little and she assigned me a lot of meds....considering my mom told her I'm lying about family situation

(I still have those meds) 

Fast forward someone who accessed my alt fb account outed my queer status without my consent to a few teachers.  My school was Catholic and it ended up being hell for me. Teachers didn't let me sit with girls. They started giving me lesser marks and other students bullied me into doing their projects knowing very well I was good in those subjects.  I remembered vividly being pushed into an empty class room before two teachers demanded me to strip to see my genitals.

My dad would frankly abuse me but it didn't hurt considering he barely has strength. Worse is that my mother never injected. Which I do, if he ever tries to abuse my mom. I have no support system and my maternal relatives blame me for everything my dad does. Each and every action is compared with my dad's and my mom stays silent 

When I finally dropped out to continue homeschooling, considering I was getting more ill the more I was in school, my mom didn't support my decision and didn't even stand up for me when I talked with my principal about the bullying.  My principal treated me like a wild animal. 

Each and every day since then has been a little better in terms of education. I took way too many course but I also learned a lot, the exams I had taken a had a nominally high score (my SAT was 1400 in my first try). But I kept working harder knowing the financial situation isn't good, still.  

Now coming back, when I was 15 my neighbor finally had enough and thought of penetrating me.  While for the past 2-3 years it was just sexual abuse, it turned into a whole more traumatic experience for me after that. I still cannot stand in the presence of older men and cant stand touching at all.  

Two years ago my mother became good friends with this guy who lived alone after his mom died. He is a nice guy  and who became family..excpect he constantly beats me up and my mom thinks he is being playful. I don't know if being hit so badly that your thighs start to quiver and won't stop shaking for hours is playful. The one time I tried to tell mom to stop it she stopped talking to me instead and preferred to spend time with that dude. Not only that but for years both of them have done nothing but mocked my existentence, tried to egg me on by saying stupid homophobic or sexist stuffs.  I stopped engaging with them which made my mom... spend only 5 minutes a day with me. If I complain that only his has favorites were being cooked (my dad esp did that considering he was very childish) my mom would throw a fit because ""I didn't contribute to the family"". As if I didn't just pay off her emis and electricity bill, and also bought her meds. 

For years I have constantly worked to bring my mom a little relief. I even bought my own phone and didn't let my mom pay for it. I even paid off my father's debt sometimes 

Now my dad isn't a good person. His debtors and clients who's work he hadn't done come and threaten us while he runs off. I got kidnapped once for that. My image in front of few friends is already shattered because of how they saw my dad crawling up-to me and begging me not to open the door. 

One day I tried to defend myself when my dad was beating me after he was drunk by kicking him. Now he is pretty thin. My mom came running after he acted like he was having seizures. My mom called me a monster and pushed me out of the house knowing very well a) i had a fever b) it was well past 12. I got too angry and walked off until a police man bought me back. Turns out my dad was acting like he always does. 

The thing is that my mom tries to integrate her friend as a family but I...cant. 1 cant trust a older man anymore (my parents don't know about the rape esp after my mom concluded I was lying about my abuse) . Due to quarantine, I have been living 24/7 with the 3 of them.  Oh they also broke my room's door so I cant close it if I want to control my emotions. For almost 3 months they keep mocking, piling their frustration and everything on me.  Yesterday night after having enough I told my mom she was hurting me. That I'm not useless.  That I work each and every day to earn money If I every needed to remove my tumor (which appears to be beign,) but my mom instead became passive aggressive and won't talk of acknowledge me.  Today morning after working till 5 am (I had art commission) I couldn't open my eyes due to migraine. I asked for meds repeteadly. Three hours later my mom threw it on the floor and walked away. 

I just.. I can't stay like this anymore.  I applied to study abroad and got into two unis with My essay,even got one full ride and one full tuition. The money I saved up for visa and passport however...disappeared from my mom's bank (since I don't have a card I can't use online payment transfer etc) and parents refused to let me go because of a) the pandemic b) my tumor c) the money my grandpa saved for Me is for my marriage only. 

Now... I don't know what to do. I really still want to be a psychologist but I don't want to stay here either. I can't. I want to complete writing my second book.  I want to live. But being in a society where you're expected to live with your parents is. .. Hard.  Besides everytime I think about leaving my mom's crying face appears before my eyes.

I haven't slept in a while either. Or eaten properly. I just need to start all over. I really need to degree to get anywhere I and I *want* to study psychology. I literally already know about everything they teach in bachelors and masters courses, I just need a proof that I know which is a degree.

138,My dad's being an asshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gogoxx/my_dads_being_an_asshole/,"Im gonna say it - my dad's been what I would consider emotionally abusing my mom for the last few weeks. She is a housewife who recently started working again during quarantine. I hugely support my mom becoming independent but not so much my dad. He claims she's too busy to do anything nowadays and picks at whatever she does wrong or forgets in a passive aggressive way. To me she's doing nothing wrong, she's working, keeping the house clean, and feeding everyone. She's also going through pre menopausal depression and he keeps threatening to leave since he can't deal with how emotionally fragile she is. I often wake up to them fighting and then my mom cries. She recently cried on my birthday as well, out of frustration. He refuses to eat what she makes for him. To give you an idea of what he's doing: if she makes food and it goes to waste because he doesn't eat it, she gets taunted that she's wasting food, and if she doesn't make anything for him she doesn't care about him. I can see her being driven crazy and she is truly trying to make things better, and he claims he's tired of trying and will find someone new in 6 months.
He's pretty nice to me and my younger brother but it's hard to ignore the stress he's giving my mother. I'm very attached to her and I'm scared she'll suffer from another stroke, this time more serious. He taunts her a lot, and I have to bite my tongue to stop myself from saying anything, because he takes his anger out on her. My mom spoke to her parents about the problems because she couldn't keep it in and her parents took her side and asked my dad why he's behaving like this etc. Well he didn't like that and told her to stop talking to them. 
So, I know people are gonna tell me to not involve myself in this or that it's not my problem but it is when your mom comes to you with suicidal thoughts. Ik it might be wrong on her part to tell me things but I really REALLY can't blame her. 
I'm scared they're going to divorce. I don't know anyone who's been through a similar process, and I live in metropolitan india so it's kind of a taboo I guess. He has said some horrendous things to her, like that he'd rather she have cancer, at least that's not emotionally draining. 
No one knows why he's behaving this way and he won't explain his behaviour or tell my mom what she's done wrong so she can fix it. He's causing her and me pain as well, my mother is so sweet and she's my best friend. She has raised both of us with so much love and car. She doesn't deserve this I feel.

This girl I’ve never met that I’ve been talking to for about 3 months made a account on reddit and just made complete bullshit up about me. She claimed that I said if we stopped talking I would kill myself (I have SS proving she’s suicidal and completely lying) along with SS of all our conversations. She also is saying I made “alt” accounts to contact her. I only have 2 emails one for my main then this throwaway. I’ve been having serious mental issues with having constant panic attacks and yes I’ve gotten professional help for it. She’s convinced I am lying since a jackass in her comments said I am most likely lying about having it. 


I am pissed out of my mind I trusted this girl and then she makes shit up about me. She also made bullshit claims I was “treating her bad” in which I got mad at her for constantly posting about me and obsessing over me. She literally made then deleted 50 post about me in a 3 day span. 100s of comments as well, she also spun a another lie around saying that I asked her out. (Once again have a SS showing her asking me out after 2 days of talking). 


On top of this she’s got a doctor from India stalking her or some shit apart of me wants to help her another part wants me to tell her go to hell. The doctor is pretty much grooming her and trying to control her. She was stupid and give him her inst and now he knows where she lives. 

I am also convinced she is in a abusive home where her parents are so controlling it’s affecting her health when it comes to socializing with boys. I am no doctor but the reason I say this is because she’s harassed multiple guys on different accounts after blocking them. She’s admitted on her reddit she got beaten for speaking English (yes I have SS of those comments as well). 

She keeps saying that that’s being strict and not abusive. I don’t think I am wrong when if you speak a different language you get beaten. I have her name (cuz of inst) and I am very tempted to call her state police department or maybe even send a tip. There’s something seriously wrong with her since she keeps making up shit about me and then crying coming back to me begging for me to forgive her.

141,How do I free myself from my dad.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/g1prh1/how_do_i_free_myself_from_my_dad/,"Hi,

I really could advice. Here is my story.

Born and raised in South India. To be more precise, I'm from Hyderabad, the city. I'm born into a Telugu Family. I'm the only daughter, I have no siblings. I'm 23, I live with my parents. I work for an MNC as a test engineer. 

I've waited all this while to get out of my house. I was about to go to the US, Fall 2020. For my Master's in Computer Science. Unfortunately, due to this coorna virus crisis, I know I'm probably not leaving anytime soon.

My father, although is nice to me at times, I feel that doesn't make up for all the times he treated me badly. He always tears me down. Truth is, Hyderabad is a great place to live in. The living costs are alright, I have friends here, climate is great, in comparison to any other part.on this planet maybe. 

But, life has always been horrible. My dad doesn't treat me like his daughter, like he has no respect for, more like.. he always shows his power and control over me cuz I live under his roof and eat the food je pays for.

 Right from childhood. He told me that I'm not a good person, because I lack discipline.

He beat me several times. The last time he hit me was 2 years ago in 2018 for wanting to go and workout at a gym. He said I should only workout at home and shouldn't get into the habit of working out outside the house, cuz in future my ""in-laws"" may not allow me. And my response to my dad was. "" Why would I wanna marry into such a family who doesn't even give me the minimum freedom, if at all I wanted to workout and.hit the gym.""
I said "" I may or may not wanna go to the gym, but I should have the freedom of going if I wanted to"". So he hit me, and I dropped on the ground, and he still kept slapping me.

 I rarely go out to hang out with my friends. Not because I don't have any friends or that I don't want to.. but my dad keeps calling me every hour and keeps yelling at me for not being.home..and.it just..at one.point I decided that it was just better to stay.home than going out and feeling bad when he would call me. 
Everytime he would call me, instantly I get scared. Like that's not how you should be feeling when it's your dad calling you on the phone right? 
Like.. all this while I have been emotionally abused and I didn't even know that I was being emotionally abused, because I thought every child.is supposed to be scared of his or her parents and that's how it is.

 It's a cycle. It's not like he treats me like crap like all the time. It could be.. one month he is nice to me and then the next 2-3 months mentally tortures.me. He makes me feel guilty for not studying..I already have a job and he still keeps pressuring me into studying. In my spare time I am on Netflix or I'm drawing stuff, he makes me feel bad for using my spare time this way. 

Constant emotional abuse. It's like.. he is bored at times ,so finds ways to make my life a living hell, to make me feel bad and yell at me even though it's absolutely unnecessary. ..in the house  I'm careful of turning off the fans or lights in any room when I exit. Because, a couple of times I forgot to turn them off and he yelled at me a few times, he hit me a few times. So having experienced that, out of fear, I makesure to turn them off.
So one day, my mom forgot to turn off the fan in their bedroom and she had left for work.(I had no idea about this.) It was just me and my dad at home. I was in my room studying. And he comes and starts yelling at me about the running lights and fan in the other room.. I told him that it wasn't me, and that I haven't been to that room , so I didn't see. And his response was.. "" then u should see and turn off"". Like even that is my fault. Like how the hell is it my fault!? Like he knows it's not my fault, right? Yet he wants to blame me.

I know all these things sound so tiny and little. But like.. it's so hard.. he says I have no discipline. I'm 23 and he still forces me to go to bed by 10pm. It's like I'm 23 years.old and still have no freedom. 

A month ago I went out for dinner with a friend and he kept calling me and saying ""are you even a human? I told u not to be out after 6pm""
 Like I can't breathe. I don't have any way out. My only way was to go for MS. I HATE my JOB. I got into testing in hope that I could make a career switch after I do my master's so I stayed at the job. There is literally no growth for me at the company. I have a low income, I can't move out of my house. I mean I'm willing to move out of my house if I could find another job after this lockdown is lifted. But I'm just really breaking down. My heart breaks everyday because of him. I just really hate him.

Our neighbours Don't really like us. We don't interact with them and we are out from morning to evening since we are working people. Since we didn't gel well with our neighbours, we kinda just ignore eachothers existence, So two of our neighbours have ganged up and have kinda made a tag team so they can bitch about my mother, my mom is not a person who takes insults kindly.  So mom and this one neighbour get into verbal fights at times, recently this neighbours mom has dropped by and she is hell bent on getting into a fight with my mom. We don't know why and what is the reason she is getting such animosity towards my mom especially. One fine day my mom is returning from work, She comments on her looks and goes as far as to almost hit her from behind, my mom turns at the right time. She doesn't hit, but it goes into a full on verbal assault, so my mom picks the broom in her hand as the neighbor and her mom are verbally abusing and getting ready to come to her. My mom just holds her broom and tells them you take a step and well see what happens. So this ends there for some days. This neighbours mom is one weird person, she keeps staring at my mom and commenting at her whenever she sees her. After few days, when my mom comes up from stairs she stairs at my mom again, my mom doesn't back down so she stares back, this women goes into a frenzy and starts yelling that my mom is some gangster or what who in the hell she thinks and all, her daughter joins and they both start verbally abusing. My mom calmly shuts the door this time and just let's them ramble, they go on for hours until this neighbours husband calms them down (somewhat). I didn't know about the incident where my mom was almost attacked for few days, my mom kept telling me not to interfere and she'll handle, even in this latter matter she held me back as she was worried that i would do something far worse. Even though i can say that i should have done something like talk to the neighbours husband or just shut these people down, i didn't, I know excuses like i couldn't go and shut them cuz i was worried what i will say or do doesn't help. Was thinking of filing a complaint to police about this almost attack incident, will probably do that because of safety reasons. Another thing to add is the other neighbour just starts bitching with this neighbour and they make my mom as the villain, and there are bunch of kids on the same floor, including neighbours own kids, they are also listening to this bitching conversation, they are exposed to this whole charade of verbal abuses and drama. My mom is good with other people beside these two neighbours. But we just can't make peace with this neighbour. I know this whole issue is not that big but it is still very bothering.

147,MeitY defends blocking of satirical Dowry Calculator website,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fjgc9u/meity_defends_blocking_of_satirical_dowry/,"https://preview.redd.it/ulyquakz8zm41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f3e67f2821088ab3dcabc58bc0dc11fbe8dd516

### Tl;dr

In November 2019, creator of the satirical Dowry Calculator website, Tanul Thakur, filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court challenging arbitrary blocking of his website. In its response to the petition, MeitY has cited provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act 1961, which prohibit giving and taking of dowry and ban individuals from publishing advertisements offering dowry, as the justification for blocking the Dowry Calculator website. MeitY has also alleged that it could not provide notice or hearing to the Petitioner prior to blocking his website because they couldn’t find his contact details even though the screenshot of the website attached by MeitY clearly displays his name and Twitter handle.

### Conflating Satire with Abetment and Advertisement

For those of you who may be unaware, Dowry Calculator is a satirical website created by Tanul Thakur in 2011 which generates a fictional dowry amount for every individual based on age, height, skin colour, alma mater etc. The satirical intent of the website is quite evident from its content and design. For instance, when one tries to pick a skin colour, the options include ‘Pitch Black (Not visible on a Moonless night)’ and ‘Wheatish (Almost white. Would need some fair n Lovely).’ The website also states that it is “dedicated to all the match-making aunties of India.” The website was blocked in 2018 after social media outrage by prominent politicians like Jyotiraditya Scindia. Read more about the controversy [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/blocking-of-satirical-dowry-calculator-website-prompts-us-to-take-action-whattheblock-savetheinternet/).

In its reply to Tanul Thakur's petition challenging the blocking of his website, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has failed to engage with the Petitioner’s arguments about his website’s satirical nature. Instead, MeitY has relied on Sections 3 and 4A of the [**Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961**](https://wcd.nic.in/act/dowry-prohibition-act-1961) to justify blocking of the website. Under Section 3, MeitY has accused the Petitioner of abetting the offence of giving and taking of dowry. When faced with arguments about the right to satirise, MeitY has summarily dismissed any possibility of the website using humour to criticize a social evil merely because it does not contain an explicit disclaimer about being satire. 

Another provision invoked by MeitY is Section 4A which prohibits any individual from publishing advertisements offering any money or property as consideration for the marriage of his son or daughter or any other relative. Section 4A is clearly inapplicable in the context of Dowry Calculator which parodies and mocks the patriarchal practice of dowry rather than glorifying it. In any case, Section 4A can be invoked only if an individual offers dowry for the marriage of his/her relative and this key ingredient is missing in the case of Dowry Calculator.

### Error: User Not Found

The constitutional validity of Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 which empowers the Central Government to block websites was upheld by the Supreme Court in [**Shreya Singhal v. Union of India**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/110813550/) because there is a mandatory obligation to provide notice and hearing to an individual prior to blocking his/her website. However, as Tanul Thakur’s case amply demonstrates, these procedural requirements are frequently flouted by the authorities. Lack of notice and hearing was one of the main contentions raised in the writ petition  and you can read more about it [**here.**](https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-the-government-for-blocking-satirical-dowry-calculator-website/)

In its response, MeitY has alleged that it could not provide notice to the Petitioner because there were no contact details available on the website. This is contrary to the screenshots of the website which have been annexed by MeitY which clearly feature the name and Twitter handle of the Petitioner. Moreover, a simple WHOIS search also provides the email ID of the Petitioner. Therefore, it is difficult to believe that all reasonable efforts were made by MeitY officials to provide notice and hearing to the Petitioner.

### Defending Secrecy in Website Blocking

The writ petition challenges the constitutionality of the confidentiality requirement present under Rule 16 of the [**IT Blocking Rules 2009**](https://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Information%20Technology%20%28%20Procedure%20and%20safeguards%20for%20blocking%20for%20access%20of%20information%20by%20public%29%20Rules%2C%202009.pdf) in so far as it applies to owners, creators, developers and curators of blocked content. This was necessary because MeitY had previously invoked Rule 16 to reject the Petitioner’s RTI application seeking a copy of the blocking order and complaint.

MeitY has argued that Rule 16 is necessary to protect the identity of the person who reports any website for hosting illegal content, and disclosure of such information would violate the fundamental right to privacy and jeopardize the safety of whistleblowers. While personally identifiable information of whistleblowers deserves protection, this does not explain why complaints received from Nodal Officers of Government Ministries and Departments, recommendations of the Committee for Examination of Requests and orders issued by the Designated Authority cannot be disclosed. If these documents contain any personally identifiable details of a private individual, those details may be redacted but a copy of these documents must be shared with the person whose website has been blocked.

The next date of hearing in the case is 21 May 2020 and the Petitioner will file his rejoinder before then. IFF has been providing litigation and RTI assistance in this case since 2019 and we are grateful to Advocates Siddharth Agarwal, Vrinda Bhandari and Abhinav Sekhri for representing the Petitioner before the Delhi High Court.

So far, so good.

Now the bad part.

Casteist and elitist. enough said.

Been bride hunting for a while. strict criteria. To him it's more of a transaction/deal with possible benefits( at least our family does not believe in dowry ). 

Should not  brought up in foreign - too ""open"", too ""fast, ""bad habits"",past boyfriends etc. Should be of comparable caste and sanskari. I should mention he smokes, uses marijuana, has had girlfriends in the past ( which I'm fine with, but can't stand the hypocrisy) .

He has poor personal hygiene and grooming habits. 

To boot has that annoying desi attitude of perpetual cynicism, sarcasm and mistaking being an asshole as being frank( ""I'm not diplomatic"") towards each and everything.  I love him to death, but he is frustrating to be around for an extended time.  He has the attitude of a know-it-all  60 year old khadoos uncle.

Thinks he's God's gift to women and any girl will be lucky to be married to him.

I've dropped hints to my parents about these things and straight up told them that any match for him is going to be fraught with difficulties and I really feel for whichever poor woman will be at the receiving end. Of course I'm the villain for pointing this out and even suggesting that ma ka laadla is anything but perfect. 

long story short, he finally found a match ( some what of a compromise as per him ). Done after the usual vetting( parents, relatives, match-makers) . Hasn't met the girl physically. The girl and them family also agreed !

WTF.

How is this still happening in the 21st century?

In the last two years, there has been no correspondence between them. He never bothered to call her. We have filed for a divorce, and have demanded that he return the dowry that he took (around 10l) and the items that we gave to my sister. It has been two years since we filed for a divorce, but he hasn't appeared in the courts even once. He keeps sending his lawyer. The court had issued a warrant to the police station last time, but then this Corona pandemic happened.

My sister has also found out the number of a woman he was involved with. But we just have the number. Will it be possible to get the call details somehow?

I am also wondering if it would be possible to get a contested divorce based on abandonment. And we want to continue our cases for dowry and 498a. I am looking for any help that might accelerate this case. Shall I write to the CM of the state? The National Commission for Women?

153,Marking the 5 year anniversary of the Shreya Singhal Judgement,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fo1fli/marking_the_5_year_anniversary_of_the_shreya/,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tsj8lu43xko41.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=cad3b794974ede68be63d15c61089875ebf71ad5

As we stare down a lockdown in most Indian cities access to the internet has never been more important than it is right now. This not only means the ability to connect but also the political freedom ensured towards such access. Here, 5 years ago a division bench of the Supreme Court composed of Justices Chalameshwar and Nariman laid down an important foundation for internet freedom that is today under threat.   


This victory was made possible due to the work and close collaboration of multiple litigants, lawyers and digital rights organisations ([**link**](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/VDznbaFeNxSGnLfrYwOBcM/Behind-the-scenes-of-the-fight-against-Section-66A.html)). We mark this day to credit not only this victory but also to indicate urgency why this victory may not hold without a well resourced defence of its core principles.   


***The Shreya Singhal judgement as a significant step for Internet Freedom***  


This was through the [**Shreya Singhal Verdict**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/110813550/) that struck down Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 which was used to send political dissenters to jail across the political spectrum ([**link to summary**](https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/shreya-singhal-v-union-of-india/)). But much beyond it, the judgement also provided relief and greater clarity on the issue of takedowns by online service providers like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram etc. These platforms which are intermediary provide services that are utilised by millions today for exchanging information and bringing comfort to each other. However, they are also abused by content that is false and misleading or to make violent threats or hate speech.   


Striking a fine balance the Supreme Court held that such platforms as per the provisions under the law cannot be made liable for the acts of the users who post such illegal content. Given the volume of content they cannot be legally required to pre-filter, screen or exercise editorial control. Here, legal liability on them arises only when they fail to act for a specific takedown notice that states that such content is illegal and is sent under a valid court order or an executive authority. This check and balance ensures that there will be an opportunity for natural justice and it will prevent what many lawyers explain as a “chilling effect”.  The third element of the Shreya Singhal judgement was on website blocking where disappointingly the court did not extensively engage with the arguments made by the petitioners ([**read more here**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/but-what-about-section-69a/)).   


**Continued threats to Internet Freedom**  


As many people shift to work from home, they wonder in the middle of a pandemic about safety, core provisions and financial stability. Many harmful impacts are being mitigated by the close to 600 million internet connections that are active in India that are helping bridge gaps of information and services. At the same time, even prior to Covid-19 the Shreya Singhal judgement and by it’s very basis has been eroded by regular attacks which have been documented and defended by us.   


For instance our work has demonstrated that despite Section 66A being termed as unconstitutional it has continued to be applied ([**link**](https://internetfreedom.in/66a-zombie/)) and there even have been serious proposals to reintroduce it ([**link**](https://internetfreedom.in/government-committee-wants-to-bring-back-section-66a/)). Takedowns by online intermediaries have become worse over time and there are proposed changes which would require increasing surveillance and censorship powers of the governments ([**link**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-urge-meity-to-press-reboot-on-the-intermediary-rules-saveourprivacy-righttomeme/)). At the same time online safety and disinformation are credible challenges. Website blocking orders continue to be made with little transparency and the ability to legally contest them ([**link**](https://internetfreedom.in/blocking-of-satirical-dowry-calculator-website-prompts-us-to-take-action-whattheblock-savetheinternet/)).   


We do not expect these challenges to be rolled back. Here it becomes necessary for our continued work to be well resourced to ensure you can continue enjoying the internet not only for work and, more importantly - play!

159,"VD Savarkar, one of RSS' most venerable thought leaders, advocated using 'rape' as a political tool. He believed Muslim women should be raped to avenge the Muslim rule in India.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gi7lza/vd_savarkar_one_of_rss_most_venerable_thought/,"It  is honestly baffling how much we have allowed the normalization of the  RSS, and what little attention is paid to the fact that the two key  progenitors of this organisation, Golwalkar and Savarkar, openly admired  Hitler and Mussolini. What makes this a lot worse is that the praise  continued on into the late 1930s, when it was clear that Nazis were  rounding up and persecuting Jews and other minorities. Unlike Bose,  whose support was out of anti-colonialism, these people admired the  ideology of the fascists. Some quotes from Savarkar validate this:

""There is no reason to suppose that Hitler must be a human monster  because he passes off as a Nazi, Nazism proved undeniably the savior of  Germany.""

""If we Hindus in India grow stronger, in time these Muslim friends of  the League type will have to play the part of German-Jews instead.""

“The very fact that Germany or Italy has so wonderfully recovered and  grown so powerful as never before at the touch of Nazi or Fascist  magical wand is enough to prove that those political ‘isms’ were the  most congenial tonics their health demanded.”

A nation is formed by a majority living therein. What did the Jews do  in Germany? They being in minority were driven out from Germany.”

This is from Golwalkar's book which was published in 1939:

""German race pride has now become the topic of the day. To keep up  the purity of the race and its culture, Germany shocked the world by her  purging the country of the Semitic Races - the Jews ... a good lesson  for us in Hindustan for us to learn and profit by.""

This is the same organisation which rules India by proxy, through  various BJP leaders who were all RSS karyakartas at one point in their  political careers. It is the Constitution and our democracy which  prevents them from taking complete control, but they remain an  existential threat to the idea of India. It is surprising how little  most Indians know about this topic, and when you confront any garden  variety sanghi/fascist with this information, they are quick to  prevaricate and seek nuance, nuance not reserved while attacking and  defaming their political rivals.

I have a lot more to vent on this issue, but I will cut this short.  This is not the lame liberal anti-Modi type argument, it goes way beyond  that, and few people realize its implications. Next time the BJP brings  up Nehru and Indira and your obnoxious friend brings up the Congress'  checkered history, do make it a point to bring this up. If history is  what makes people decide who to vote for or not, then these facts  deserve to be brought up in the public discourse as well.

179,Although rape is a serious problem in our country that needs to stop. There is another problem of false rape accusations that nobody seems to wanna talk about.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fleoe8/although_rape_is_a_serious_problem_in_our_country/,"Before I start, I'd like to make it clear that I do believe Rape is a heinous crime and there should be severe punishments for those who commit it. Having said that, shouldn't someone who is innocent also getting the same punishment and being discarded by society be talked about too? what about the woman who made up the story, shouldn't she be punished for ruining someone's life? 

According to the National Crime Records Bureau, a total of 38,947 rape cases were reported in India in 2016. In 10,068 cases – about a quarter – the women claimed it was rape on the false promise of marriage. In Andhra Pradesh state, 45% of all rape cases filed in the past two years fell into the false marriage category. Just think about that, every 1 in 3 is an innocent man, and in Andra Pradesh, that's 1 in 2 where for every 2 rape accusations an innocent man's life is ruined.

It's sad because Rape is a very sensitive subject which people avoid talking about and these problems are still happening every day. I'm tired of hearing every other country saying that our country is the rape capital of the world and no one if only a few dares to talk about false accusations. 

I referenced an article in this post for stats and here is the link:  [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/11/spare-innocent-men-anguish-india-ruling-aims-to-end-false-claims](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/11/spare-innocent-men-anguish-india-ruling-aims-to-end-false-claims)

208,India is never going to be a rape free country.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fgujeq/india_is_never_going_to_be_a_rape_free_country/,"I know “never” is a strong word. Hear me out.

As some may have seen the posts of few randian user expressing their surprise to the stuff that came out of their parent’s mouth regarding violence on muslims. 

Now ask yourself this. How strong do you believe the moral fabric of a country is, which chooses to turn a blind eye to the subjugation of a community based simply on their religion ? How much hard will it be to jump from hating because of religion to hating because of gender. Now, I understand this is comparing apples and oranges because no community will outright become scornful towards an entire gender. The point I’m trying to make is those who believe they are the superior authority because of “religion” won’t like someone challenging their authority and will find ways to prove their power over another. These same people will loathe women making a fuss about harassment, or women fighting for their empowerment. This is discounting the fact that these “camps” that are being built will only result in cases of absolute horror many of which will never come to light. 

Lastly if there are women reading this, most of you will probably not get in a situation where you’ll be a victim of rape. However I know you know that fleeting dread that comes over you when you feel like you’re not safe. For you it’s fleeting but for many that dread only is the start of something much more heinous. 

PS: I’m not a good writer, I’ve tried to write as best as I can to express my thoughts. Hopefully this “rant” gets the point across.",rape,,1,india never going rape free country,know never strong word hear may seen posts randian user expressing surprise stuff came parent mouth regarding violence muslims ask strong believe moral fabric country chooses turn blind eye subjugation community based simply religion much hard jump hating religion hating gender understand comparing apples oranges community outright become scornful towards entire gender point trying make believe superior authority religion like someone challenging authority find ways prove power another people loathe women making fuss harassment women fighting empowerment discounting fact camps built result cases absolute horror many never come light lastly women reading probably get situation victim rape however know know fleeting dread comes feel like safe fleeting many dread start something much heinous ps good writer tried write best express thoughts hopefully rant gets point across,india never going rape free country ,ind nev going rap fre country ,india never go rape free countri ,india never going rape free country ,ind nev going rap fre country ,india never go rape free countri

236,"The boys involved in the locker room chat definitely need to face consequences in spite of being minors, but that won’t solve the underlying issue. Unless sex education is made a serious part of the school curriculum.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gdw4hy/the_boys_involved_in_the_locker_room_chat/,"I recently learnt about the locker room chat incident and have fairly been able to wrap my head around the situation after being OOTL. I am appalled at the apathy and lack of respect towards women in general, especially when that generation is supposedly to be the future of the country. These boys need to face consequences although I am doubtful about how successfully they will catch the most responsible individuals. 

But, even this would be a reactive measure. Will this really stop the possibly countless other children that are involved in such conversations? Maybe to a degree, maybe some will distance themselves out of guilt, shame, fear or realization, but the larger picture is that this will not tackle the problem at its core.

I am a guy brought up in Delhi myself, and I know first hand how boys at that age could behave. But this has become a norm solely due to the fact that the school syllabus lacks sex education. When I was a kid, we brushed by the topic of sex in our biology class, and we would giggle at the very mention of it and I am myself guilty of this. I guess 13 year old me couldn’t get his head around the fact that this is a very serious topic that will be huge part of his adult life and would also define a large part of who he is as a human being. And this is the problem. The prudish nature of the policy makers and the older generations is creating a very toxic atmosphere. I guess most of you can derive your own conclusions from the above but here are my points about why it is necessary to include sex education in the curriculum:

1. Sex education doesn’t just teach you about the physical act of sex.

2. It teaches you about the various methods of protection not just against pregnancies but STDs.

3. It teaches you about consent and that no means no.

4. It is also teaches you how to behave and respect boundaries with other people, but most importantly with the other gender. And this is not just during sex, this directly influences you to respect boundaries during other interactions.

5. It teaches you the sexual problems and, to a degree, social problems the other gender faces.

6. It can also counsel you if you are having problems due to sex, or if you are frustrated due to the lack thereof.

7. And lastly it teaches you that people, regardless of gender, are individuals with their own aspirations and dreams, and that the opposite gender is not just an instrument to gratify your sexual needs.

I thought these off the top of my head while I am lying in bed trying to doze off, so I am sure there might be quite a few more. The embarrassment that people feel while discussing sex needs to go. I know that most of you guys know this already but this is not true for a huge chunk of the population, but why be embarrassed to discuss something that is so natural to most species on the planet. 

The fact is that the younger generation is getting comfortable with sex, but on their own terms, without a lack of direction. And this is the problem. If children are eventually going to learn about such an important topic as sex, why not guide them in the right direction.

So being a prude, denying the access to this, sometimes in the name of culture, and shirking responsibility is a very naive approach and this needs to change earnestly. There really needs to be push for this ASAP, and policy makers need to acknowledge the fact that this is a problem. 

I am not trying to vilify anyone. I know that not everyone agrees with that abhorrent mindset, but we really need to acknowledge the problem of we want to tackle it. If in your family your kid is misbehaving, you as a parent will be responsible for that, and that analogy holds here as well. Also please never try to downplay this with the statement that “boys will be boys”. I hope that in a few years from now, when people use that phrase, they would mean it as a compliment instead.

Edit: 1. I would also like to emphasize again that by sex education I don’t mean a course where they teach you about the physical act of copulation. That already exists in our biology courses. What we need is a well built and well researched subject that tackles most, if not all, direct and indirect topics pertaining to sex, which I have already listed out.",rape,13.0,1,boys involved locker room chat definitely need face consequences spite minors solve underlying issue unless sex education made serious part school curriculum,recently learnt locker room chat incident fairly able wrap head around situation ootl appalled apathy lack respect towards women general especially generation supposedly future country boys need face consequences although doubtful successfully catch responsible individuals even would reactive measure really stop possibly countless children involved conversations maybe degree maybe distance guilt shame fear realization larger picture tackle problem core guy brought delhi know first hand boys age could behave become norm solely due fact school syllabus lacks sex education kid brushed topic sex biology class would giggle mention guilty guess 13 year old get head around fact serious topic huge part adult life would also define large part human problem prudish nature policy makers older generations creating toxic atmosphere guess derive conclusions points necessary include sex education curriculum 1 sex education teach physical act sex 2 teaches various methods protection pregnancies stds 3 teaches consent means 4 also teaches behave respect boundaries people importantly gender sex directly influences respect boundaries interactions 5 teaches sexual problems degree social problems gender faces 6 also counsel problems due sex frustrated due lack thereof 7 lastly teaches people regardless gender individuals aspirations dreams opposite gender instrument gratify sexual needs thought top head lying bed trying doze sure might quite embarrassment people feel discussing sex needs go know guys know already true huge chunk population embarrassed discuss something natural species planet fact younger generation getting comfortable sex terms without lack direction problem children eventually going learn important topic sex guide right direction prude denying access sometimes name culture shirking responsibility naive approach needs change earnestly really needs push asap policy makers need acknowledge fact problem trying vilify anyone know everyone agrees abhorrent mindset really need acknowledge problem want tackle family kid misbehaving parent responsible analogy holds well also please never try downplay statement boys boys hope years people use phrase would mean compliment instead edit 1 would also like emphasize sex education mean course teach physical act copulation already exists biology courses need well built well researched subject tackles direct indirect topics pertaining sex already listed,boy involved locker room chat definitely need face consequence spite minor solve underlying issue unless sex education made serious part school curriculum ,boy involv lock room chat definit nee fac consequ spit min solv und issu unless sex educ mad sery part school curricul ,boy involv locker room chat definit need face consequ spite minor solv underli issu unless sex educ made seriou part school curriculum ,boy involved locker room chat definitely need face consequence spite minor solve underlying issue unless sex education made serious part school curriculum ,boy involv lock room chat definit nee fac consequ spit min solv und issu unless sex educ mad sery part school curricul ,boy involv locker room chat definit need face consequ spite minor solv underli issu unless sex educ made seriou part school curriculum

238,Mythbusters - Taken from Rahul Gandhi's website,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gkvd62/mythbusters_taken_from_rahul_gandhis_website/,"""A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting its shoes on""

Here, for your entertainment, are some of the craziest tales spun by the opposition's propaganda factory. And the truth.

**What about the viral video where Rahul Gandhi speaks about ‘aloo ki factory’?**

Context is everything. That bit was a fragment of an interaction with distressed farmers in Uttar Pradesh. One farmer suggested a potato chip factory in the region, to which Mr Gandhi responded. The entire interaction is presented here (comment in question at 1.22) Farmers’ concerns and agricultural policy are clearly not as ‘viral’ as a sentence plucked out of context by an opposition more comfortable with jeering than thinking.

[https://vimeo.com/300017070](https://vimeo.com/300017070)

**Wait, another aloo question. Why did he talk of a machine that would turn potatoes into gold (aloo se sona niklega)?**

That is indeed a ludicrous thing to say. Only, Rahul Gandhi didn’t make that claim, he was making fun of the prime minister’s outrageous promises. Again, a fragment of the speech was deviously presented by the BJP’s team, to suggest the very opposite. Here is the full video, for those who care about the truth.

[https://vimeo.com/300018438](https://vimeo.com/300018438)

**Why did he claim that connecting MRI machines would improve healthcare in India?**

In a question about healthcare, one of the the ideas that Mr Gandhi referred to was the internet of things. Connecting devices like MRI machines, CT scanners and other equipment through the cloud and analysing their findings is an important part of diagnosis and care. This data-driven approach is the future of healthcare, and it is already a reality in many parts of the world. So Rahul Gandhi was referring to a global trend that his critics may not yet be aware of.

For those who want to know more, here is a handy article from the [Economist](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/02/01/a-revolution-in-health-care-is-coming)

**What in the world did he mean by escape velocity of Jupiter?**

Rahul Gandhi was speaking about the extra push needed for Dalits to reach the same footing as others. As a socially disadvantaged community, it takes greater effort for them to shake off the downward pull of their environment. Just like it takes greater energy to escape Jupiter’s gravitational field than that of earth.

Escape velocity is also a commonly used term in social research – take this example from [Harvard Research](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/lkatz/files/aer.103.3_fryer_katz_pp_2013_all_0.pdf)

It’s not that hard to understand, even for the BJP.

**Why did he say ‘poverty is a state of mind’?**

Rahul Gandhi had said that apart from material deprivation, poverty is also a state of mind. This is borne out by social science research on the psychological effects and insecurities created by scarcity and precarity.

Media headlines mangled his words to suggest he said poverty is only a state of mind. As usual, the BJP cried hoarse. The Dalit Resource Centre of the Gobind Ballabh Pant Social Science Institute, where Rahul Gandhi made the statement, clarified the facts, and most newspapers carried corrections the next day, but the damage was done. Deliberately. Read: [Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/rahul-spoke-about-poverty-of-thought-clarifies-host/story-ERPthC1QhVxjxuZM0ZWgMM.html), [Indian Express](http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/institute-quotes-rahul-gandhi-as-saying-poverty-is-just-a-state-of-mind/1152249/)

**Why did his “woke up this morning, last night” go viral?**

Because to err is human, and to mock is the BJP. It was a slip of the tongue. Happens to everyone, especially those whose words are constantly watched.

This list is likely to keep growing. Lies will continue being generated, because the only limits are in the BJP’s imagination. Some of these allegations, though, are more serious and unconscionable than others:

**What is the truth about the Sukanya rape case?**

This charge, cooked up by political opponents and peddled on foreign websites, was struck down by the Supreme Court of India for being “without substance and without an iota of evidence” . Not only that, the court heavily fined the petitioners for causing reputational damage to Rahul Gandhi. Half of that penalty was due to Rahul Gandhi, and half to the woman who they claimed had been raped. Read: [NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rape-allegations-defamed-rahul-gandhi-says-supreme-court-cbi-may-explore-foreign-angle-502158), [Mint](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/JXeMExPzO8PeL9k7S7m1FI/Supreme-Court-dismisses-case-against-Rahul-Gandhi.html)

That this malicious lie continues to lurk in a right-wing echo-chamber shows that some people are impervious to the truth and contemptuous of due legal process. They will go to any length to discredit someone they don’t like.

**Was Rahul Gandhi detained in Boston with drugs?**

No. Those sharing these fantasies, without offering even a shred of evidence, are obviously smoking something strong.

245,"Unpopular opinion: You don't punish people for what they think or say, you punish them for what they do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gdczde/unpopular_opinion_you_dont_punish_people_for_what/,"This post is for those who are ""shocked to the core"" after seeing those screenshots from that shitty boys' locker room group chat. You may disagree with what I say, but please do read this once and then maybe leave a comment on whether you agree or not, and why. Just don't downvote the post and fuck off, let's have a proper discussion. Here goes.

Those boys have a depraved mentality. They are sick and I hope they grow the fuck up, they are sixteen and seventeen, for fuck's sake. I think a sixteen-year-old is in the tenth standard. I remember my tenth. I was surrounded by boys like that, maybe even some girls. And I am from one of the better schools in Delhi. This kind of shitty talk was not super common, but it was still there. It mostly originates from the biggest troublemakers in class, they all used to be a part of a group. Like attracts like, I guess. They talked shit about girls, there was objectification and very inappropriate language. They even talked shit about teachers and it infuriated me. They used to talk like that every day. Their group reinforced such behaviour. They were carefree and arrogant. I maintained my distance from them, but I don't think I would call them as bad as rapists or criminals. I don't have any interaction with those kids from my school now, so I don't know if they matured, but I sure hope they did.

The point is, kids in high school are fucked in the brain. They don't think twice before spewing shit. But they say shit because they don't think there will be repercussions. They would not dare say that shit to a girl's face when repercussions are guaranteed. They don't mean half of the shit they say. Those boys in the group chat did not send inappropriate DM to girls. They did not harass any girl. They said horrible shit amongst themselves because they thought it was okay. But as far as I am aware, everything was inside that group chat. I am not sure if they exchanged ""morphed"" photos of underage girls, but if they did, then it probably qualifies as a criminal offence and they are rightfully fucked. But from the screenshots that I saw, they were exchanging fully clothed photos of girls. Why is that a problem? People objectify celebrities, is that okay? Celebrities get paid to be objectified, is that okay?

Also, just for the record, **the separate Snapchat incident where someone said they will ""rape"" someone, was completely wrong**. Conspiring harm upon someone is not okay, and I think legal action has been initiated against him.

We need to understand that thinking and saying are NOT the same as taking action. Having a depraved mentality is not a crime, taking action on it is. Condemn the mentality, but saying something that you find offensive is not a crime. You don't jail a paedophile for being attracted to kids, you jail them for acting on that desire. There are porn subreddits and porn videos where horny people will comment nasty shit, but it's all a fantasy, a desire, and nothing else. If someone likes crime or action movies, it does not mean they are capable of committing that crime or beating people.

Moving on to why a teenager would feel the need to say shit like that, it takes us to the biggest issue at hand–how we can change this mentality of objectifying people, especially women, as a society. It didn't start with this group chat nor would it end with them. I used to think good education will solve these fundamental issues, but I am not so sure now. This is what we should be talking about instead of just shaming those pricks.",rape,,1,unpopular opinion punish people think say punish,post shocked core seeing screenshots shitty boys locker room group chat may disagree say please read maybe leave comment whether agree downvote post fuck let proper discussion goes boys depraved mentality sick hope grow fuck sixteen seventeen fuck sake think sixteen year old tenth standard remember tenth surrounded boys like maybe even girls one better schools delhi kind shitty talk super common still mostly originates biggest troublemakers class used part group like attracts like guess talked shit girls objectification inappropriate language even talked shit teachers infuriated used talk like every day group reinforced behaviour carefree arrogant maintained distance think would call bad rapists criminals interaction kids school know matured sure hope point kids high school fucked brain think twice spewing shit say shit think repercussions would dare say shit girl face repercussions guaranteed mean half shit say boys group chat send inappropriate dm girls harass girl said horrible shit amongst thought okay far aware everything inside group chat sure exchanged morphed photos underage girls probably qualifies criminal offence rightfully fucked screenshots saw exchanging fully clothed photos girls problem people objectify celebrities okay celebrities get paid objectified okay also record separate snapchat incident someone said rape someone completely wrong conspiring harm upon someone okay think legal action initiated need understand thinking saying taking action depraved mentality crime taking action condemn mentality saying something find offensive crime jail paedophile attracted kids jail acting desire porn subreddits porn videos horny people comment nasty shit fantasy desire nothing else someone likes crime action movies mean capable committing crime beating people moving teenager would feel need say shit like takes us biggest issue hand change mentality objectifying people especially women society start group chat would end used think good education solve fundamental issues sure talking instead shaming pricks,unpopular opinion punish people think say punish ,unpopul opin pun peopl think say pun ,unpopular opinion punish peopl think say punish ,unpopular opinion punish people think say punish ,unpopul opin pun peopl think say pun ,unpopular opinion punish peopl think say punish

A girl posed as a boy talking about her own gang rape to ""test the character"" of that certain guy. When the initial news made headlines all these women were posting and discussing over it left and right on fb. It should have been done.

When this new development came to life. Silence. Not a single of those girls came forward for any discussion. My friend's fb post has been up for a few hours now and not a single woman has commented. 

There is no black and white here. The Locker Room group exists and yes all that shit happens. But those screenshots, the ones which caused the most uproar are fake. Such fake incidents eventually end up harming women too. And I am not dictating what should someone post or not. It their life. But it just makes me wonder where are these women now?

248,Is such a girl wife material?,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fuqnpg/is_such_a_girl_wife_material/,"I met this girl 8 months ago. We bonded pretty well and became really intense and involved with eachother. she is 26 and we both are from India. We both come from privileged backgrounds.

during the course of our relationship she told me a few things about herself

She told me she has dated a lot and been more than friendly with many guys in the past.

She told me she was raped 2 years ago when she was out partying. She was out with social friends and someone spied her drink. and she woke up in some man's apartment naked after he had taken advantage of her. I really sympathized with her then. y. She told me she did not tell her parents out of fear and dealt with all of it by herself

She told me in spite of this she dated a lot. lot of men who do cocaine and avoiding arrest, partied and got drunk till late with friends, and was also on dating apps and met around 20 boys from those apps. She also hooked up once after the incident. She said she loves to socialise and get to know new people.

but these things confuse me...

1. When she met me for the 5th time in her life when we just started dating (8 months ago). she got drunk at a house party at 4 am beyond her capacity and was in no state to walk. she threw up in the lobby.
2. On my birthday, just after 3 weeks of the first incident, she go drunk again and ended up having to throw up
3. On her own birthday which was a week later to mine she again got drunk (but that is probably excusable?)
4. During another house party she got drunk and started puking all over the road at 5 in the morning
5. On Christmas eve, we were at a club and she took off her panties and was dancing drunk and in her drunken state her skirt was riding up and a guy from the group was gawking at her privates
6. She went for a destination wedding and since I was scared if she can handle herself or be responsible I was worried. She did not answer the phone till 10 am in the morning saying she was partying and that the party just got done while I was up all night panicking as she told me she would call me in a few hours.

&#x200B;

I fail to understand how someone who was raped can be so irresponsible towards their own safety. she normalizes her behavior and says we just come from different worlds. I do not know if I can trust her for her own safety. Am I being too narrow minded or thinking too much? Is such a girl wife material?

249,"I think I got mentally assaulted but I respect her so much that I just don’t know what should I do next. Please help, I really need your advice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fexh4c/i_think_i_got_mentally_assaulted_but_i_respect/,"Around 3 years ago, I was preparing for my engineering entrance exams in India and meanwhile I was looking for some freelance website development work. After some fail attempts, I searched for best web designers and developers in India and message each of them asking for their stories and help and basically to become my mentor. 

It’s from there I met this girl (I won’t tell the real name, so let’s just say “Ria”). So, Ria is 10 years older than me and is paralysed. Yes, she can’t walk. 

So yeah, with time we became online best friends and we both used to share each and every part of our lives without worrying about if we’re gonna get judged. She helped me with freelance work. Guide me when I was lost and I mean, I really respect her. I literally am, whoever I am today is because of her. For me, she is like a real sister. 

Around 2 years ago, we started a book blog then and by the end of 2018, it got ranked as the 2nd best book blog of India and things were going super fine. We were earning good and our bond is only going stronger until November 2019. 
 
Wait, first let me tell you, this August 2019, she helped me in getting me a job in Mumbai and that’s for the first time that we met. 

I was focusing on creating the content and as busy with site’s SEO and she used to handle all the authors, money and reviewers. See, I belong to a very small town in North India so I couldn’t catch up with the events she goes to, people she meets and you know. So, with time I started feeling isolated and I did tell her this. Okay, so moving straight to the point.

I came to know that I might never become a father in my life and that broke me from inside. I tried telling her but by this time, we hardly talk about anything other than the blog. So, I let this thing hurt me from inside. I was sort of angry with her because she used to tell everyone that she’s my best friend but she couldn’t even read my face. After some days, I got a message from her that I’m not serious and I should be and I threw all the hate I’ve been carrying on her. I honestly tell her my feelings though in a very rude manner. She neither texted nor called for a week and then, I realized my mistake and said sorry and tried explaining her my feelings. Things became good, for a day. After that, she even stopped texting me about the blog. 

I, for my exams came back home in December. Also, I had just opened a travel company with two friends here and we managed to agree 18 travellers to go with us. We got our advance amounts and we invested it into hotels booking, car bookings etc. But then, CAA protests started happening in Delhi and everyone backed out and started asking for their advance back. It was a huge financial loss. 

Meanwhile, while everyone was disturbed with the riots happening all over the capital, Ria started commenting and posting stories about how is it right and I felt bad for two reasons: 
1. She didn’t even care to ask for my opinion 
2. Because of her my younger brother got bullied as he is studying in Delhi and few of his college students are part of the protests

I tried talking to her but then she started saying that I’m trying to snatch her right of speech away from her and how wrong am I! Then on this New Year, she changed the credentials of all the social media platforms and even removed my name from the articles that I’ve written in the past. That same day, I lost my dog and for a whole goddamn week, I looked for my dog but:(((( 

I went back to Mumbai and tried myself to engross fully into the work but nothing was helping. I started an instagram and twitter account just for the sake of my content portfolio and one of my tweets got viral in a really negative way and the response I got in it really made me depress. At that same time, some girl accused my younger brother that he raped her and.... it might sound nuisance but that was a lot. A lot. There are some other things too which I can’t mention but yeah, I went into real depression and then, thus I went to an NGO which is the best free alternative of therapy and I resigned from my job and came back. 

I have given two years of my life to this book blog and it sucks that I’m not even a part of it. Till last january I was literally  begging her to take me back. Telling her sorry and keep on kicking my own self-respect. She said things which literally made me ask myself once, “Have I even done anything in my life!”. I mean it was the rock bottom. 

A friend helped me to get through it... so, yeah main topic is a few days ago, she texted about how sorry she is and I should understand that if she wouldn’t have changed the passwords, things only would have gone worst. 

I tried understanding her point and a day before yesterday, I wrote a message that she was with me when no one else was so, I can’t hate you and neither do I want to. I just want you to be my friend again like we used to be and she replied, “Even I want that”. I thought she will ask me now to come back and everything’s gonna be normal but two days later, she is busy posting on Instagram and that’s all.

252,The Dignity of Life and the Migrant Crisis,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gfrha4/the_dignity_of_life_and_the_migrant_crisis/,"The Middle class commentary on the migrant worker situation should evoke no other reaction than anger. Before the lockdown ample middle and upper class Indians had been flown into the country in government curated flights. Many of them were thermal checked, many were quarantined, many were asked to home quarantine. Many of them chose to flout norms of physical distancing and went about their business. For those who were quarantined, many of them shot videos of the conditions in quarantine centers and put them all over the internet which were widely circulated by their brethren all over social media demanding immediate accountability. All this while the numbers continued to rise. 

Cut to 23rd March, a nationwide lockdown was imposed with less than 4 hours' warning. Less than 4 hours' with no certainty from the PM's speech regarding what services will remain functional and what will not. All of you making commentary right now started rallying around the whole city panic buying. Many of you sent money across to your children, parents, friends and relatives immediately to make sure they had the means to hoard stuff for the next 21 days. By the time there was clarity regarding essential services, the police was closing down shops and harassing everyone out on the street looking for basic essentials cluelessly. Many also started rummaging for contacts to get passes to bring your loved ones back home. You made sure you were okay, you made sure your loved ones were okay and then sat down in front of your televisions and phones to impart your expert commentary on what it is that migrant workers should do. 

Imagine being 700kms away from home, being thrown out of your work site by your employer, having your shelter taken away by your landlord (if you even have a separate shelter), with no stocks of food or water, with no ration card, with no cash, with no medication, no means of transportation, with no balance on your phones, and with no certainty. Imagine knowing that your only shot at any sort of certainty being family back at your home. What would you do? Would you wait to hear an expert commentary from a person who has no idea about your situation or would you walk back? Would you wait for expert commentary or would you demand to be taken back to any place where you can eke out a life? And most importantly, would you wait for expert commentary or would you look to ensure that your last bit of dignity is not compromised and eroded? 

Whether the migrants from diifferent clusters be brought back or not is NOT YOUR PLACE TO COMMENT. In a situation of a pandemic, our fundamental rights are not suspended. The right to life with dignity remains as vital and fundamental as ever. Therefore, the migrant workers were brought back. Therefore, they deserve to live in a dignified manner. Therefore, they deserve dignified space, food and other amenities. Dignity is key. It is this lack of dignity that you refused to compromise with when people of your class and caste had been complaining about in the airport quarantines. And rightfully so. You need to recognise your casteism and classism the moment you mete out differential treatment, demanding 'justice' for your class-caste members and 'adjustment' and 'greater good' from migrants. Holding two different standards is heirarchizing, it is discrimination. 

And while we're at it, there is an inherent anxiety that requires irrevocable recognition from the state. Migrants who have been away from their homes for so long are being brought into quarantine centers even when they have reached their own districts. This is undisputably important. But merely facilitating 'counseling' without reassuring them that the social inequalities that give rise to their situations will be taken care of is an incomplete, half hearted attempt at ensuring dignity and security. While they are in quarantine, the state needs to take concrete steps to ensure that their families also have access to basic rights and entitlements, that they also have food to eat, water to drink, a home to live in, access to money, healthcare and the promise of a secure income or opportunity in the future.

258,Kerala High Court hears challenges against mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gib3e6/kerala_high_court_hears_challenges_against/,"### 

https://preview.redd.it/dilg3h4e4cy41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=960e3fc9cd0281aeb23986fff935064449dbe7c1

### Tl;dr

Today, the Kerala High Court heard two petitions challenging mandatory use of the Aarogya Setu app. The app was made mandatory for all public and private sector employees by the Ministry of Home Affairs through guidelines issued to States/Union Territories under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. IFF provided legal assistance for the petition filed by Jackson Mathew, Managing Partner of Leetha Industries which was accompanied by an expert affidavit by Professor Subhashis Banerjee from IIT Delhi. During the hearings, the Kerala High Court directed the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to file a reply and to state on record that data collected by the app will not be misused. The petitions are listed next on 18 May.

### Download Aarogya Setu or Face Jail Time

On 1 May 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued guidelines making use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for all persons in containment zones and all public and private sector employees. In case of the latter, the head of the organization has been made responsible for ensuring 100% coverage of the app among employees. These directions were issued by MHA under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 (DMA) and any violation is liable to be punished under Section 51, DMA (up to 2 years imprisionment) and Section 188, IPC (up to 6 months imprisonment).

Since its launch, the Aarogya Setu app has been mired in controversy about its privacy and security practices, and we have analysed it in our [**working paper**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/) which provides privacy prescriptions for COVID-19 tech interventions. After the Aarogya Setu app was made mandatory for vast sections of society by MHA on 1 May 2020, John Daniel, the General Secretary of Congress Thissur District Committee filed a PIL before the Kerala High Court challenging the constitutionality of these directions. Yesterday, another writ petition was filed by Jackson Mathew, the Managing Partner of Leetha Industries which employs 50 people against Aarogya Setu being made compulsory through the threat of criminal sanction. The petition filed by Jackson Mathew is accompanied by an expert affidavit by Dr. Subhashis Banerjee, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Delhi which highlights utility and privacy concerns with the Aarogya Setu app. IFF retained counsels provided assistance for this petition.

After the petition was filed by Jackson Mathew yesterday morning, the government has released a  [**data access and knowledge sharing protocol**](https://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Aarogya_Setu_data_access_knowledge_Protocol.pdf) for the app. We will shortly be posting an analysis of the protocol and its failure to address concerns about legality, purpose limitation, data minimization, transparency and accountability.

### Contagion of Technosolutionism

Despite serious concerns about the accuracy of COVID-19 surveillance apps, governments across the world have tried to leverage these apps to contain the spread of the virus. As Susan Landau [**notes**](https://www.lawfareblog.com/location-surveillance-counter-covid-19-efficacy-what-matters), when you have a hammer, it is tempting to see nails everywhere but India doesn't even have the level of smartphone and internet penetration required for such apps to even be theoretically effective. In a country where only 25% of the population has access to bluetooth enabled smartphones, the government has made the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for accessing essential services like [**railways**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aarogya-setu-app-mandatory-for-travel-on-15-special-trains-railways/article31563211.ece) and this will have a devastating exclusionary impact. 

In addition to this, bluetooth and GPS signals are not an accurate estimate of whether someone has been in close proximity (6 feet or less) with a COVID-19 infected person. This can lead to a high number of false positives and false negatives which end up causing more harm than good. For instance, bluetooth signals cannot recognize physical barriers such as walls and floors which make virus transmission impossible, and therefore, they may misidentify individuals as COVID-19 positive and send the authorities on a wild goose chase. Similarly, since bluetooth based apps cannot account for surface to person transmission, they will also yield false negatives. 

### ""Privacy by Design"" Not

Despite the government repeatedly claiming that the Aarogya Setu app does not raise any privacy or security concerns, the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of the app tell a very different story. The writ petition filed by Jackson Mathew analyses these issues in great detail but in brief, the Aarogya Setu app violates the following data protection principles:

1. **Legality**  
The Aarogya Setu app which collects sensitive health and location data of millions of Indians has been launched without any governing legislative framework. The Disaster Management Act does not provide legislative basis for deployment of the Aarogya Setu app because it does not include any provisions for collection and processing of personal data. Retired Justice BN Srikrishna who headed the Committee on Data Protection has also [**explained**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aarogya-setu-app-mandate-illegal-justice-b-n-srikrishna-6405535/) that making Aarogya Setu mandatory without an enabling legislation is completely illegal. He also pointed out that the protocol issued by the government cannot substitute legislation by the parliament.
2. **Consent**  
Based on [**MIT Tech Review’s Tracker**](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/07/1000961/launching-mittr-covid-tracing-tracker/), India is the only democratic country which has made use of COVID-19 surveillance apps mandatory. Other countries which have made such apps mandatory are China and Turkey. However, in Turkey, only confirmed COVID-19 patients have to mandatorily download the app.
3. **Purpose Limitation and Data Sharing:**  
Clause 2(a) of the Privacy Policy states personal data collected at the time of registration can be used for *“medical* *and administrative interventions necessary”* in relation to COVID-19. This suggets that data collected by the app can be used for lockdown/quarantine enforcement. This is inconsistent with global best practices. For instance, the European Commission has clearly stated that data collected by COVID-19 surveillance apps should not be used for law enforcement or commercial purposes. 
4. **Data Minimization**  
Aarogya Setu collects location data through GPS and it can be used to track real time movements of individuals. This violates the principle of data minimization because location data is not necessary to determine if a user was in proximity of a COVID-19 positive person and bluetooth signals are sufficient for this purpose. 
5. **Security**  
The Aarogya Setu app anonymizes data by assigning each user a static device identifier. This kind of weak anonymization has been highlighted as a significant privacy concern by Professor Subhashis Banerjee in his expert affidavit. He notes that unlike other apps which issue new tokens to be used as a fresh ID after pre-specified time intervals, Aarogya Setu uses a static device identifier. This combined with the fact that Aarogya Setu collects several other data points including meta data, makes the app vulnerable to an attack where users can identify other users who have been determined by the app -rightly or wrongly - as high risk spreaders.
6. **Transparency**  
Clause 3 of the Terms of Service prohibits reverse engineering of the app which means that security researchers cannot independently study it to perform good faith vulnerability disclosure. The government has also refused to provide any technical specifications of the Aarogya Setu app. In contrast, other countries like Singapore, Israel and Australia have published the source code of their apps and other technical specifications relating to cryptography and bluetooth. 
7. **Accountability**  
Clause 6 of the Terms of Service exempt the government from any liability for a person’s inability to access the app, inaccurate information about COVID-19 status of persons in one’s proximity and any breach of user data. Clause 7 of the Terms of Service further states that the government makes no warranties about the app’s accuracy and that such services are never wholly free from defects, errors and bugs. 

### What happened at today's hearing?

The PIL filed by John Daniel was listed before a Division Bench of Justice Anu Sivaraman and Justice MR Anitha as Item No. 8 and it came up for hearing around 11:30 AM. During the hearing, the counsel for the Petitioner sought interim relief to ensure that no coercive action was taken against anyone for failing to download the app. The counsel for MeitY insisted that Aarogya Setu was the best app in the world and emphasized that a protocol had also been issued to address privacy concerns. The bench was disinclined to intervene at this stage because ""extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures"". However, the bench directed the government to file a statement on record that the data collected by the app will not be misused and listed the matter on 18 May. 

The Writ Petition filed by Jackson Mathew was listed before a Single Judge Bench of Justice Gopinathan as Item 71 and it came up for hearing around 5:15 PM. During the hearing, Justice Gopinathan enquired about the previous proceeding before the Division Bench. Advocate Santhosh Mathew appearing for the Petitioner explained that this petition was not a PIL and highlighted the practical difficulties faced by the petitioner who would have to purchase smartphones for his employees and check whether they were using the Aarogya Setu app or risk criminal prosecution. The counsel appearing for MeitY once again insisted that the Aarogya Setu app is supposed to help the government fight COVID-19 and unless a large part of the population downloads it, the app will not be effective. In response, Advocate Santhosh Mathew emphasized on the aspect of criminal penalities and noted that even the Registrar or Chief Justice could be liable for imprisionment if any of the High Court employees failed to download Aarogya Setu. Justice Gopinathan acknowledged that this was a valid concern and he directed the counsel for MeitY to get instructions and file a statement on these aspects. This petition will be listed next on 18 May along with the petition filed by John Daniel before the Division Bench. 

Advocate Santhosh Mathew and his team comprising of Advocates Anil Sebastian Pulickel, Vijay Paul and Jaisy Elza Joe led this important court intervention. Lawyers, Gautam Bhatia and Abhinav Sekhri, IFF retained counsels, Vrinda Bhandari, Devdutta Mukhopadhyay and Sidharth Deb also provided drafting and research assistance for this petition.

260,We wrote to NCRB and MHA requesting them to halt their ongoing National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) project.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g5w347/we_wrote_to_ncrb_and_mha_requesting_them_to_halt/,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7f60yfc3dbu41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=295bf3a056f250df993c0705d5545d303816e197

**Tl;dr**

The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has sought to revise its Request for Proposals (RFP) for tender bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) according to an update on its website dated March 23, 2020. IFF has previously called for a three year moratorium on the government use of facial recognition technologies under its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In this instance, we have shared a representation with the NCRB and the Hon’ble Minister of Home Affairs Mr Amit Shah. In it, we highlight legal and constitutional issues with such projects. As a remedy our representation seeks a recall of this RFP and a halt to the tender process itself. It also provides concrete policy recommendations for the Government to consider.   


**Background on AFRS**

The RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), which has an estimated budget of INR 308 crore, to further create a national database of photographs. According to the RFP, this database is purported to be used to swiftly identify criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like:  


1. Passport database under the Ministry of External Affairs,
2. Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) by the National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA),
3. Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) by the NCRB under the MHA ,
4. Women and Child Development Ministry's KhoyaPaya Portal,
5. Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) by the NCRB under the MHA
6. Any other image database available with police/other entities.  


The NCRB first released the RFP calling for bids for the creation of AFRS on 28 June, 2019 (Document Reference: 02/001). Initially, the deadline for submission of bids was on August 16, 2019 (Read our first post on the subject [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/maskon/)).  However, the deadline for submission has been extended six times due to administrative reasons by the NCRB.  According to an [**update**](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/tender/AFRS.pdf) dated March 23, 2020 published on the NCRB’s website, the RFP is now being revised. The current deadline for submission is May 22, 2020.  


As pointed out in our previous [**blogpost**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/) on the matter, use of this technology without having legal safeguards in place could lead to harms such as discrimination and exclusion which will be difficult to undo. Additionally, in the absence of a strong data protection law, use of this technology could easily lead to mass surveillance. A strong data protection law is needed to hold AFRS accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties to ensure that there is proportionality in processing the data collected. Proportionality during processing of personal data means that only that personal data which is adequate and relevant for the purposes of the processing is collected and processed.   


**Steps taken by IFF**  


IFF has sought a [**three year moratorium**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-have-written-to-the-government-seeking-a-3-year-moratorium-on-government-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-in-india-projectpanoptic/) to be imposed upon all government use of facial recognition technology. IFF has also consistently opposed the use of facial recognition by NCRB since the first report on AFRS came to light. IFF has previously sent a [**legal notice**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-ncrb-responds/) to NCRB seeking that they recall the RFP and halt the tender process since the project lacks a legal basis. IFF would like to thank the NCRB for responding to our previous legal notice and also for their decision to revise the RFP. However, we are of the opinion these steps being taken by the NCRB are insufficient and there is a need for further changes and immediate action.

In this representation, therefore IFF recommends that:  


1. NCRB immediately rollbacks its request for proposals and halts its ongoing tender process for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System.
2. The Government of India place a moratorium of three years on the use of facial recognition technology by government authorities in India during which time an informed consultation takes place between the various stakeholders and civil society organizations to understand the ambit of this technology
3. The Government of India immediately passes a strong data protection law to hold government functionaries accountable when they collect people’s personal data whilst deploying such systems.
4. The Government of India should pass a specific law with regard to facial recognition technology to regulate the technology in the country. This law should be developed as a result of the informed consultation process as mentioned above.  


**What’s Next?**

IFF has been mapping the use of facial recognition all over the country as a part of its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In addition to seeking a three year moratorium on the use of this technology, we have been constantly seeking information about these projects all over India and have also been engaging with government authorities whenever the need arises. IFF will be developing and publishing more material as part of our ongoing analysis of this topic under this project in the coming months.

261,Supreme Court reserves order in petitions seeking restoration of 4G internet in Jammu & Kashmir,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gdago8/supreme_court_reserves_order_in_petitions_seeking/,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bnznmm0koqw41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bac5d549e0a4e08dfb9efb3cd0bef40cd93c966

### Tl;dr

Today, the Supreme Court heard substantive arguments regarding the constitutionality and legality of internet restrictions in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 pandemic. These restrictions were imposed through orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 which directed Internet Service Providers to slow down mobile internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G only. These internet slowdown orders were challenged before the Supreme Court by the Foundation for Media Professionals, Private School Association of Jammu & Kashmir and Soayib Qureshi. During today’s hearing, counsels for the petitioners highlighted the impact of the internet slowdown on access to healthcare and education in the region and the Government sought to justify the restrictions by citing national security concerns. After hearing arguments for nearly three hours, the three judge bench has reserved judgement in the matter.  


### Background

On 31 March 2020, the Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) filed a petition before the Supreme Court challenging restriction of mobile internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G only during the COVID-19 pandemic. The continuing internet restrictions in Jammu & Kashmir were also subsequently challenged by the Private School Association for Jammu & Kashmir and Soayib Qureshi. These petitions were listed for hearing before a three judge bench of Ramana J., Gavai J. and Reddy J. which had also heard the previous challenge against the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu & Kashmir on 05 August 2019 at the time of abrogation of Article 370 which provided a special status to the former state. 

Through their pleadings and oral arguments, the petitioners highlighted the impact of the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 lockdown on access to healthcare, education, livelihood and justice. These contentions were supported by personal narratives from doctors, teachers, students, business persons and lawyers in Jammu & Kashmir and a technical comparison of web performance at 2G and  4G speed (Read more [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/supreme-court-directs-govt-to-file-reply-to-petition-seeking-4g-restoration-in-j-k/)).  

The petitioners further submitted that restriction of mobile internet speed to 2G only did not satisfy the proportionality standard endorsed by the Supreme Court in its judgement in [***Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India***](https://internetfreedom.in/scs-judgement-on-kashmir-communication-is-just-the-beginning/) because the State had failed to demonstrate that imposing internet restrictions on an entire population for over 9 months was the suitable, least restrictive and proportionate method of addressing terrorism during a public health crisis. To demonstrate this, the petitioners cited empirical research which suggested that internet shutdowns were counterproductive and could lead to more violence and recommended less restrictive alternatives such as blocking of specific websites. The petitioners also relied on the State’s own data to demonstrate that terrorist activity in the region has continuously decreased since 1990 despite the introduction of smartphones and high speed internet. These factual and legal arguments have been explained in greater detail in the written submissions filed by Foundation for Media Professionals and you can read more [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/198ta44Q0gHvGRjMdj2xSZSuzFUuRhIfA/view?usp=sharing).   


### The Government’s stance

In its counter-affidavit and during oral arguments, the Government repeatedly invoked national security concerns to justify the internet slowdown. It cited the history of cross border terrorism in the region to explain why internet restrictions were necessary to prevent disemmination of fake news by terrorists which could incite the public. However, if this argument about the region’s geo-political history was taken to its logical conclusion, it would mean that internet restrictions in Jammu & Kashmir would be permanent and this was expressly ruled out by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.* Further, misinformation is a pan-India problem but other states have not resorted to blanket internet restrictions and instead relied on post facto take down and prosecution. 

In its counter-affidavit, the Government also made mutually contradictory statements about the internet being slow enough to foil the activities of terrorists but also being fast enough to not hamper the activities of ordinary citizens. For instance, it argued that terrorists would not be able to upload or download heavy data files at 2G speed but that somehow students will be able to continue their education through e-learning apps and videos at 2G speed. The Government also claimed that resources by the Ministry of Health and World Health Organization could be easily accessed at 2G speed despite technical simulations demonstrating that interactive resources like the WHO’s situation tracker do not work at observed 2G speeds at all. 

The Government further argued that it had taken ameliorative measures to ensure people could access COVID-19 related information and continue their education despite lack of effective internet access. For instance, the Government claimed that it had established call centres to address people’s queries and classes were being broadcast on TV and radio for students. However, the Government did not address the petitioners’ arguments about how telemedicine was impossible without video facilities and how short one sided broadcasts cannot substitute a full day of interactive classes for students through video conference.  


### What happened at today’s hearing?

During today’s hearing, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, Senior Advocate for Foundation for Media Professionals began substantive arguments by highlighting how the internet slowdown during the COVID-19 crisis was undermining right to health because doctors could not access latest information or treat patients through telemedicine which requires video facilities. He also emphasized on the impact of internet restrictions on the right to education and the inability of students in Jammu & Kashmir to continue their education using video conferencing tools. In response to a query by the bench about fixed line connections operating at normal speed, he emphasized that a very small number of people have fixed line connections compared to mobile internet and due to the lockdown, it was impossible for people to travel to another place to access a fixed line connection. Finally, he urged the bench to consider that besides making bald assertions, the government had failed to show a rational connection between 4G internet speed and terrorism in the first place, and in fact, the government’s own data suggested that there had been a substantial decline in terrorism since 1990 despite an increase in the number of internet users. 

Mr. Salman Khurshid, Senior Advocate for Private School Association of Jammu & Kashmir focused on the impact of deprivation of 4G internet on the right to education and highlighted the inadequacy of one hour classes being broadcast on TV and radio. He further noted that the government had failed to publish the orders of the Review Committee which was responsible for determining the necessity and proportionality of continuing internet restrictions every seven working days. Mr. Soayib Qureshi appearing for himself echoed similar concerns and suggested that the Government should have used less restrictive alternatives such as blocking specific websites. 

Mr. KK Venugopal, the Attorney General and Mr. Tushar Mehta, the Solicitor General appearing for the Government argued that even during a pandemic, national security concerns should be paramount and the executive branch should be the sole decision maker in such matters. They also submitted that the petitioners’ concerns were unwarranted because many Indians do not have smartphones or access to the internet but there have been no reports of anyone dying on account of lack of internet access. 

After hearing extensive arguments from all parties for nearly 3 hours over video conferencing, the 3 judge bench has reserved its order in the matter. 

### Credits Roll

**Tl;dr**

While most of the public’s attention remains targeted at the Central Government’s push to drive adoption of the Aarogya Setu app, we must remain vigilant when it comes to state level uses of health data during COVID-19 as well. The controversy surrounding the contract between the Government of Kerala and Sprinklr Inc. is being addressed by the Kerala High Court in the ongoing matter of  *Balu Gopalakrishnan and Ors. v. State of Kerala and Ors.* The main questions raised pertaining to there being no safeguards against the commercial and unauthorized use of the health data of the citizens of Kerala by Sprinklr Inc. While an interim order dated April 24, 2020 provides some relief, it  fails to address certain key issues. IFF has shared a  representation with the Government of Kerala and an Expert Committee formed on the issue. In it, we have pointed out the lacunae in the order and have made specific suggestions on how best to resolve them. Our main recommendation is, in keeping with the ideal of competitive federalism, the Government of Kerala should develop a state level framework to regulate the collection, processing, storage, and security of health and related data during epidemic situations under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897.  


**What was the issue with Sprinklr Inc.?**

The Government of Kerala’s contract with Sprinklr Inc., a US based company, aims to create an online digital software/platform to process and analyse data of patients and those vulnerable/susceptible to COVID-19 in the State of Kerala. The arrangement aims to set up a Data Analytics Platform which integrates data from repositories across the Government, agencies and from the field so as to meet the exigency of a massive influx of data due to the pandemic.   


The [**controversy**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-is-the-sprinklr-row-kerala-govts-covid-19-response-6371205/) arose when allegations were made that the government did not follow due procedures in appointing Sprinklr and thereby risked the transfer of crucial health data of thousands of people to pharmaceutical companies. While this is a valid concern, it also highlights the lack of governance discourse related to fundamental risks to people’s privacy which should have been a principal consideration while determining contours of the arrangement. The Contract between the two parties fails to address these risks.    


More specifically, the accompanying Non-Disclosure Agreement between the parties, states that the purpose of the contract is that, “the parties wish to explore a business opportunity of mutual interest and benefit”. This demonstrates a desire to keep available an opportunity to commercially exploit people’s sensitive personal information like their health data. Any such commercial use however can only be done after a system of legislative and independent institutional oversight is put in place. Such institutional oversight is lacking currently.   


**What did the Kerala High Court do?**

The Kerala High Court to its credit did highlight that maintaining data confidentiality is key when processing the health data of citizens of the State. The Court has issued an interim order dated providing some intervening relief to citizens even as it deliberates on the issue. These are:

* It mandated that a process of anonymisation be followed before sharing this data with Sprinklr Inc.
* The Order directed that such data be shared with Sprinklr Inc. only after informing every citizen from whom the data is collected and obtaining specific consent from them.
* The Order injuncted Sprinklr Inc. from breaching the data confidentiality of the data obtained from the citizens of Kerala and ordered them to not disclose the data to any third party.
* The Order instructed Sprinklr Inc. to transfer back the data once the term of their contract with the Government of Kerala is completed.
* The Court injuncted Sprinklr from advertising or representing or holding over to any third party/person/entity – of whatever nature or composition – that they are in possession or have access to any data regarding COVID-19 patients or persons vulnerable/susceptible to it.  


However, there were some issues that the High Court failed to address, the most important of which is the  auditability of their Order. In our representation, we have highlighted the lacunae in the HC order and in the Contract between the Government of Kerala and Sprinklr Inc.   


**The Situation in the United Kingdom is similar and we can look to how Civil Society Organisations have addressed this there to create a solution**  


On May 18, 2020 civil society organisations, privacy advocates and academic researchers including Article 19, Liberty, openDemocracy and Privacy International wrote a [**joint letter**](https://medium.com/@anoukruhaak/open-letter-b7cb79832064)to the UK Health Secretary’s office. In particular the letter addressed a March 2020 announcement by the UK’s National Health Service to grant private-sector tech firms access to the aggregated health data of millions of UK citizens towards building a datastore collected to specifically respond to the coronavirus.   


In it these disparate stakeholders urged the NHS to suitably clarify to the public, the following aspects, before commencing the development of the datastore:

1. What is the need for such a solution? What problems does such an arrangement aim to solve by building the datastore? What alternatives have been explored?
2. How is the datastore financed? Has the NHS considered the trade-offs? What do these considerations look like?
3. How does this proposal shift the balance of power from the public to the private sector?
4. Who has control over the data in these public private partnerships ? Who is most at risk and how are they protected?
5. What is the exit strategy? For what duration is the data collected and what happens when that period ends?
6. If the exit strategy depends on the pandemic ending, then what criteria are used to determine when the pandemic is indeed over? (i.e. when is the promised destruction of the datastore triggered?)
7. What public facing documentation do you intend to provide describing this datastore and the various data sources?
8. Will further use of the datastore by the Department of Health Care Services, or its partners, outside the scope as currently defined, be communicated with the public?
9. What party do you intend to use for privacy compliance and security auditing of the system  


The situation in the UK is similar to the current situation in Kerala where Sprinklr Inc. has been entrusted with the health data of the citizens of Kerala. In particular, in the current instance data has been shared with a private party, not even located within Kerala, towards building an unknown software/analytics platform, which may even be leveraged for commercial use.   


**Constitutional Federalism is the need of the hour**

In an [**op-ed**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/opinion/city-columns/how-the-lockdown-is-triggering-a-constitutional-crisis/articleshow/75513611.cms), Mr.Raman Jit Singh Chima, who is also the Chair of the IFF Board of Trustees, has pointed out that the ideal of federalism which is enshrined in the Constitution of India is being undermined by Disaster Management Act, 2005 notifications being issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs. “Much of what the Ministry of Home Affairs is issuing in its orders under the Disaster Management Act impacts the powers of states and local bodies, as well as the fundamental rights of citizens.”   


[**“Among the exclusively delineated areas of legislative and executive competence of States is the power and responsibility of public order and police.”**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/towards-cooperative-federalism/article30729075.ece) Additionally the competence to legislate on matters relating to public health including collection and processing of health data is contained in the State List under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. Keeping these factors in mind, we believe that the Government of Kerala should create a state level framework to regulate their collection, processing, storage, and security of health and related data during epidemic situations passed through Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. This may be done by issuing regulations on the same under the state government’s powers under the same act.   


We believe this presents the Government of Kerala with an opportunity to pass a framework which can allow for the responsible use of health data through ICT systems during epidemics/health crises. The framework may be applicable to both government actors and private parties as well. It would allow for adequate legal and institutional safeguards which suitably protect people’s privacy, whilst creating a legal pathway for data-side and tech based interventions as well.  


**Final recommendations by IFF**

Finally, aside from the urgent need for a regulatory framework as indicated above, we urged the Government of Kerala to suitably address our various concerns with its arrangement with Sprinklr Inc. as detailed throughout the representation. In particular we urge them to:

1. Application of the Kerala HC order should be verified by creating transparent systems of audit.
2. The Kerala Government should prescribe a clear date of termination of the Contract with Sprinklr. They should also prescribe clear guidelines which can act as Standard Operating Procedure upon termination of Contract for complete extraction of data from Sprinklr.
3. Adherence to best practices principles for collection and processing of health data which include currently existing frameworks such as the GDPR and the Supreme Court’s decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India.
4. Finally, the Government of Kerala should use the questions asked in the open letter shared with the UK’s NHS vis-a-vis its datastore, as a template to deepen public engagement, understanding and dialogue on the project. Such engagement will help reduce privacy and security concerns and would also help people to share insights and suggest measures which may be taken for course correction on an immediate basis.

### Tl;dr

IFF has written an open letter to Justice A.P. Shah and shared a copy of it with the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). In it we have expressed our concerns of self censorship beginning to permeate across online video platforms. We have sent this as a response to three recent developments. First, the Government filed a counter affidavit before the Supreme Court last month in which it endorsed self-regulatory institutional mechanisms for domains like social media. Second, the Minister of Information & Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar met with industry players setting a 100 day timeline for market participants to agree on a code of conduct and adjudicatory mechanism. Third, Hotstar India’s largest online curated content providers banned an episode of Last Week Tonight which dedicated an 18 minute segment to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Therefore, we have written to Justice Shah to take cognizance of these developments and the risk the IAMAI’s self regulation code poses to people’s right to receive and impart information.

### Background

In early February 2020, the Internet and Mobile Association of India launched a new Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it sought to establish a second tier oversight mechanism under the aegis of a Digital Content Complaint Council (“DCCC”). The DCCC has been constituted in a manner which is eerily similar to the Broadcast Content Complaints Council (“BCCC”) which is the relevant self-regulatory oversight mechanism for television in India. Notably, the BCCC and the accompanying self-regulation code operates parallel to statutorily recognised content norms for cable television. When such parallel frameworks subsist it is likely that content creation, removal and censorship decisions err on the side of caution. As we all know, India’s TV ecosystem has aligned itself to be a risk averse space where content remains homogeneous and its quality pales in comparison to global creative economies.

We have studied the IAMAI’s self regulation framework and many of the same problems that we see with respect to TV come up in this context as well. It establishes vague prohibited content norms which go beyond constitutional thresholds and provisions under relevant laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. In addition we are concerned with the way that the framework has been designed in an exclusionary manner, the scope and applicability of the DCCC and its interactions with government in particular, and limited actual considerations of the public’s right to free speech and expression.

We believe it is likely to translate into a paradigm where there will be excessive self censorship which will plague India’s online content space. At a broader level we believe it will lead to an overarching chilling effect which will mean that certain types of content will not get made and it will lead to a body blow for plurality and diversity in India’s fledgling online content ecosystem. Sensing these concerns we have already written to the [**IAMAI** ](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/)and the touted chairperson of the proposed DCCC, the former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, [**Justice A.P. Shah**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-gentle-open-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-the-online-video-self-regulatory-code/). In it we have articulated our aforementioned concerns with the framework.

Subsequent developments since then reinforce our trepidation with the DCCC and the IAMAI’s self regulation code. To be sure, the Code has only five signatories who have developed the code in conjunction with the IAMAI in an opaque manner-- with no inputs from external stakeholders. The exclusionary nature of the Code is magnified by the fact that the online curated content space in India has more than 35 payers. Therefore, it is concerning that the Indian Government has started taking steps to formalise industry wide adoption and endorse such parallel frameworks which fuel self censorships.

### Latest Developments

In an ongoing matter on online content regulation, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) filed a counter affidavit filed before the Supreme Court of India. In it MIB [**endorsed**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/self-regulation-model-may-work-for-ott-companies-govt/articleshow/74410087.cms) a self-regulatory institutional mechanism for other domains like social media. This concerns us because it seems like there is a slippery slope brewing which could lead to a chilling effect spreading across major online platforms (both which are fully curated and those which are semi-curated).

Additionally, a [**report**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/curb-your-ott-instincts/articleshow/74449516.cms) in the Mumbai Mirror dated March 03, 2020 revealed that the Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr Prakash Javadekar met with online content industry representatives. In the meeting, the Minister gave the representatives a 100-day timeline by when they must arrive at a consensus on an industry code of conduct and an appropriate adjudicatory mechanism. This is clearly indicative of a risk that the Government may be pushing other segments of the industry to become signatories to the IAMAI Code and come under the jurisdiction of the DCCC. If this happens we could be fast heading to a restrictive online content space along the lines of how it functions in the Indian television ecosystem.

Our concerns self-censorship were of course exacerbated by the recent incident in which Hotstar, one of the primary signatories to the IAMAI’s self regulation code, proactively [**banned**](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-last-week-tonight-episode-criticising-narendra-modi/article30920096.ece) an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver which was centred on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

### What have we written?

Given these multiple developments we have written to Justice A.P. Shah outlining these incidents and how it ties up with our stance on the IAMAI self-regulation code. We have urged the concerned parties to revisit their current positions and will follow up with them to consider avenues through which self-regulation does not become a gateway to trample upon people’s freedom of speech and expression, overall creativity, diversity and plurality. To this end, we have shared with both Justice Shah and the IAMAI Governing Council links to a recent report by [**Access Now**](https://www.accessnow.org/guide-how-to-protect-human-rights-in-content-governance/) which looks at different models of online content governance. The report also examines self-regulation and outlines certain key principles in ensuring such systems do not violate human rights.

IFF will continue to continue to engage with the subject, and fight towards ensuring self-regulation does not become a means for collateral censorship.

266,ITS LOCK ON for Indian Real Estate,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxmvof/its_lock_on_for_indian_real_estate/,"  

***LOCK – ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.

· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.

**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

268,The Indian Judiciary and the collegium System - How the judiciary attempted to preserve its independence but went too far,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gcojre/the_indian_judiciary_and_the_collegium_system_how/,"While we all lament an unchecked legislature and executive , there is something far more dangerous that exists till now - the Unchecked Judiciary & its Collegium System 

To know the story about the collegium system in India one must know that’s it not backed by any constitutional provision but rather by Precedents set by The Supreme Court in a cases : **Supreme Court Advocates-On-Record Association v Union of India** AKA the Second Judges Case . 

To understand you need to know these things : 

1) Under Article 124 , The President has to appoint the judges of  the Supreme Court in consultation with the Chief Justice of India . 

2) Under Article 217 & Article 222 respectively, The President has the power to appoint and transfer the judges of an High Court in consultation with the  Chief Justice of the High Court. 

3) Article 224 , gives the President the power to appoint additional judges for a period of two years in case any High Court is overburdened with cases 

So to begin with how the collegium system came about , we must look at the history preceding the cases . It was a time of political turmoil in the 1970s when the Congress was attempting to impose executive & legislative supremacy and passed constitutional amendments to override Court judgements and prevent any check by the judiciary on the executive’s actions. The Govt also started favouring the appointment of judges who ruled in their favour .

Another tool that the Govt used was to appoint additional judges (even though there would be vacancies for permanent positions) in High Courts and leverage their positions through this tool. This went on even during the emergency when as many as 57 judges were transferred. 

Though the congress govt was thwarted after the emergency it came back in power. 

In 1981 , Law Minister P.Shivshankar issued a circular to the governor of Punjab and the chief ministers of all states (excluding the north eastern states) requesting them to 

1)obtain the consent of additional judges in high courts to be appointed in permanent positions 

And 

2) The consent of judges ,who would be offered judgeship in their high court ,**to be appointed initially in a high court other than their state high court** 

This created an uproar as it was another attempt to bring the judiciary under greater political control. As a result , eight writ petitions were filed and the matter was heard in the case of 
*S.P.Gupta v Union of India* AKA **The First Judges case.**

The Government argued that the petitioners had no locus standi in the case but the Supreme Court retorted by saying that “the cause of Justice can never be thwarted by procedural technicalities” . 

The First Judges case , while acknowledging the concept of judicial independence , preserved that the President should have the last say in the matter of appointment of judges whereas the the Chief Justice would have no veto rights . 

While the First Judges Case did not endow any veto power to the judiciary it did question the Government on its opaque procedures for transfer and appointment of Judges and asked for more transparency on the principle of “Right to Know” and also set the ground for the concept of PIL (that locus standi isn’t necessary for matters of public interest). 

In the Late 1980s , while public opinion was mobilised against the Judgement of the First Judges case , the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record filed a petition in the Supreme Court asking for Vacancies in the Supreme Court and various high court positions to be filled . 

While hearing the petition , the SC acknowledged that the Judgement in the First Judges case needed some reconsideration and directed the matter to a nine-judge bench. 

The Majority decision in this case I.e. the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record v Union of India (AKA The Second Judges Case) ruled that the opinion of the Chief Justice , during the appointment of judges , would prevail in contrast to the First Judges case where the President’s opinion prevailed. 

However to decentralise the power of the Chief Justice , the Supreme Court said that the Chief Justice must also consult two other senior most judges of the Supreme Court and High court. 

**The two judges are now what is called as the collegium of the Supreme Court (or High court as the case may be)** 

And this birthed the collegium system in India . The judgment while advocating for a consultative, integrative and participative procedure , did the opposite and left an unchecked judiciary. 

As a result , while there are mechanism to keep the other two arms of the government in check , there Remains limited recourse to check the judiciary. The judges , even though can be impeached by the parliament , is a cumbersome process as it requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of the parliament. 

The judgment is till today being criticised as endowing too much power upon on the judiciary.  The criticism comes from judges who ruled on the Judges’ cases and even from judges who have been part of or close to the collegium bodies of courts . The collegium is bashed on the grounds of lacking transparency and favouring nepotism. 

Many academics have remarked how the judiciary by its very nature is counter-majoritarian and hence a judiciary that is so opaque poses devastating problems for the functioning of a democracy and the balance of power between the three pillars of a democracy. 

Though the Bill for the creation of National Judicial Appointment Committee was passed in 2015 by both houses , it was struck down by the Supreme Court as being unconstitutional

269,Police and the Common Man during these trying times...,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fr3rrq/police_and_the_common_man_during_these_trying/,"I had posted this in the Bangalore sub, but reproducing here since it was suggested to me. Some edits done.

What happened in Bangalore on Wednesday:

1. Video surfaces of two youth beating two cops on the road during the lock down, everyone bays for their blood and call to hang them in public for beating cops on duty. Media runs amok saying such people should be made an example of, don't spare them, the usual media mileage.
2. Youth arrested immediately, Police Commissioner says they were performing wheelies on empty roads and attacked cops when stopped. Sent to jail under stringent sections. Rowdy sheets opened against them, which means their future is screwed.
3. Day later, video surfaces on Facebook showing what happened *before* the youth attacked the cops. They are seen been kicked around by the cops, feet stamped with police boots, pockets emptied, all the while they're pleading with the cops to let them go. This video is shot by someone from a balcony. Obviously something triggered them to fight back.
4. No media attention to this video, no explanation from cops. The youth in jail, obviously beaten to a pulp by the cops. Future gone.
5. On Thursday: youth taken to scene of crime for re-creation of events. Apparently they attacked a police woman with stones and had to be shot in the leg!

**Tl;dr**   
Last week a flurry of complaints were filed against news anchor Arnab Goswami for, amongst other things, “inciting communal hatred” under various provisions of the IPC and also included, was a charge under the now defunct  Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act). S. 66A  of the IT act has been struck down, by the Supreme Court, as unconstitutional in 2015. However, despite [**repeated directions**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-directs-states-to-sensitise-cops-about-scrapping-of-section-66a-of-it-act/articleshow/68011762.cms) by the SC, that all pending cases under S. 66A be closed and also that no fresh charges may be registered, the provision continues to be invoked across the country.   


***#IndiaVSSection66A***   
Last week, [**at least 16 complaints were made**](https://www.barandbench.com/news/16-complaints-so-far-in-congress-ruled-states-for-fir-against-arnab-goswami-for-defaming-sonia-gandhi-read-complaints) at various police stations all over India, against news anchor Arnab Goswami. The complaints were filed in respect of comments made on his news show,  on 21st April 2020, for, amongst other things, “inciting communal hatred”. On the basis of these complaints, [**FIRs were filed under multiple provisions** ](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/derogatory-remarks-against-sonia-gandhi-hp-cong-leaders-file-fir-against-arnab-goswami/story-SCRtOHkeG6yRjhp32hGD2M.html)against Arnab Goswami in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana and Jammu & Kashmir. The complaints  mention offences under Sections 117, 120B, 153, 153A, 153B, 295A, 298, 500, 504, 505, 506 etc of the Indian Penal Code and Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000(IT Act) .  


S. 66A of the IT act, introduced by amendment in 2008, penalized sending ""offensive messages"" via online communication. The wide powers of the section were frequently used to stifle political dissent. For example, in May 2014,[ **five students were temporarily detained in Bangalore for allegedly sharing a message on the mobile application “WhatsApp” that was critical of newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi**](https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/05/24/stifling-dissent/criminalization-peaceful-expression-india).  To combat this a case was filed before the Supreme Court seeking a declaration that Section 66A of the IT Act, 2000 was unconstitutional.   


In March 2015, S.66A was declared unconstitutional by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in *Shreya Singhal v. Union Of India* as it violated the right to freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. The Court found that S. 66A was vague and could be arbitrarily interpreted to penalize even innocent speech. Significantly, the Court found that the provision was not ‘severable’ i.e., no part of the section could be saved and the provision as a whole was declared unconstitutional. This would have meant that the provision was void ab initio i.e was deemed to never have existed on the statute books. The effect of this would be that all pending cases would be dismissed and no fresh cases would be instituted under S. 66A.  


***#UnconstitutionalProsecutionsExposed***   
In light of the provision being declared unconstitutional, the story should have ended there. However, a 2018 study, ‘[**Section 66A and Other Legal Zombies**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3275893)’, highlighted the continued use of S. 66A, including cases registered after the Shreya Singhal decision.   


Taking note of the above-mentioned study, People's Union for Civil Liberties (‘PUCL’), one of the original petitioners in the Shreya Singhal Case approached the court in January, 2019 highlighting the study and applying for directions to ensure implementation of the Court's decision. Prior to the hearing, in a [**counter-affidavit,**](https://internetfreedom.in/section-66a-bites-the-zombie-dust-righttomeme-section66a/) the Union of India detailed steps it had taken to generate awareness on S. 66A. This included a letter the Government wrote on 11th January, 2019 and then a reminder on 14th January, 2019 to various state governments asking them to furnish data on S. 66A cases and also asking them to close them. Some states responded. For instance, [**Kerala stated that there were 19 cases that were filed after S. 66A was held to be unconstitutional**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/section-66a-information-technology-act-supreme-court-shreya-singhal-judgment-5599263/) and they would be closing all of them. The Court by judgement dated February 15, 2019, [**not only directed that all pending cases under S. 66A be closed but also that no fresh charges may be registered**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-directs-states-to-sensitise-cops-about-scrapping-of-section-66a-of-it-act/articleshow/68011762.cms). The SC further directed that  the Shreya Singhal judgement be sent to all courts in the country, to senior administrative officers and director generals of police.   


Inspite of the above, fresh claims were still instituted, as recently as last week, under the now unconstitutional provision. In January 2020, the [**Karnataka High Court imposed a cost of Rs 10,000 each on two police officers for registering an FIR under Section 66 A of the Information Technology Act**](https://thewire.in/law/karnataka-hc-section-66a-it-act). As recent as February 2020,[ **a guest lecturer at a college in Assam, was charged under S.66A of the IT Act**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-lecturer-held-for-facebook-post-on-delhi-violence/article30949145.ece), arrested and later sent to judicial custody for posting derogatory remarks against the BJP, the RSS, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and ‘Sanatan dharma’. In March 2020, [**the Patna High Court granted bail to two petitioners accused of offences, amongst others, under S.66A of the IT Act**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/159506330/). They had been in custody for 6 months. These instances highlight the continued invocation of S. 66A, 5 years after it was declared unconstitutional, despite further directions by the Supreme Court in 2019. This points to a systematic failure by the judiciary and law enforcement system.   


***#IFFBatsForDigitalRights***  
This is not about Arnab Goswami, but about the use of an unconstitutional provision of law. Even today people, ordinary smartphone users all across India are being prosecuted across the breadth of India. A casual search through the [**IndianKanoon database**](https://indiankanoon.org/search/?formInput=%22section+66a%22+sortby%3Amostrecent) (like Pintoo Kumar) shows cases of FIRs being actively prosecuted as recently as March, 2020. This is more than 5 years after a Supreme Court judgement and is a stain on our criminal justice system.   


We are committed to erasing Section 66A from every FIR and criminal case all across India, irrespective of the person who is being prosecuted. The journey of S. 66A highlights the importance and challenges of monitoring and ensuring compliance with the final decisions of the Supreme Court. To meet this challenge we have come up with a data driven, evidence based solution in partnership with [**CivicData Labs**](https://www.civicdatalab.in/). We will be working in partnership with CDL to build a tool to track cases under S. 66A at the district level between 1st January 2008 till 15th February 2020. We intend to analyse the data to identify and highlight the gaps in the system, put forth recommendations and advocate for a stronger, more accountable and transparent system. S. 66A must die a complete constitutional death.

271,Quarantine lists breach individual privacy! Social solidarity in times of Covid-19 #SaveOurPrivacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/frlkw7/quarantine_lists_breach_individual_privacy_social/,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/awhmevos5rp41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=96a2a28c67ff238e88d2e527bef8579ed78ca71e

**Tl;dr**

Multiple press reports have emerged on ""lists"" of persons placed under quarantine who are suspected to be infected with Covid-19. Many of these lists have been circulated on social media and WhatsApp groups, primarily those formed by Resident Welfare Associations and Group Housing Societies. The circulation of this information is a  breach of personal privacy and is exposing such quarantines to second order harms. To address it we have urged the Ministry of Health; Ministry of Urban Development and Housing; and  the National Real Estate Development Council (NARDECO) to urgently issue advisories.    


**Time to stop, spy the neighbour!**

It is day 6 of a national lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Repeated calls are being made public officials to maintain social solidarity and offer support. This spirit of social cooperation is jarring to the indiscriminate sharing of lists of persons who are suffering from Covid-19 infection; or, are suspected of being carriers; or, fall within a risk category due to recent travel. These lists of persons are being principally shared through digital means. This increases the field of dissemination of personally identifiable information and can lead to acute harm. 

Several press reports have emerged that such lists are being circulated on social media and WhatsApp groups, principally those formed by Resident Welfare Associations and Group Housing Societies. Further compounding this problem is that many of these lists seem to have been compiled by departments in State Governments and published on websites or, ""leaked"". 

These lists are not uniform and while may not contain the name of the person do contain personally identifiable information such as the addresses and the relatives of such persons. It is enabling discrimination, denial of essential health care and food items and even leading to instances where persons placed under quarantine are being placed under pressure of eviction by landlords and apartment societies.

We placed reliance on specific provisions of law including the Supreme Court's 9 judge bench privacy judgement, provisions of Indian Medical Council Regulations and the Information Technology Act. Here much of our thought has been shaped by the leadership of the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan that[**has written a representation on March 23, 2020.**](http://phmindia.org/2020/03/23/jsa-statement-on-breach-of-confidentiality-around-coronavirus-cases/)

Beyond a breach of law, is a poor public policy choice at the time of a pandemic. Sharing of information weakens social solidarity that is needed to counter this shared and unprecedented social challenge. It is literally turning neighbour against neighbour. 

We believe that state responses can be crafted while protecting the fundamental right to privacy as guaranteed under the Constitution. In our constitutional framework, one of the core values to advance the aims of social justice is of, fraternity. This value in ambedkarite thought has been [**explained by Shiveshwar Kundu**](https://roundtableindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9561:ambedkar-s-tryst-with-fraternity&catid=129&Itemid=195) as, ""\[c\]entral to this idea of fraternity is the *notion of friendship*."" By releasing such lists containing personally identifiable information, this notion of social collegiality is replaced by private vigilantism. It undermines the founding ethos of our republic is beautifuly contained in Narsi Mehta’s poem [***Vaishnav Jan To Tene Kahiye***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaishnava_Jana_To) that was often sung as a hym by Gandhi jee as a call for practiced empathy. 

**Continued actions on protecting digital rights in times of Covid-19**

IFF intends to do more. As next steps we commit to writing directly to the Chief Ministers and the Health Departments of specific state governments. Through the week we will also be articulating a nuanced position on contact tracing as being offered by several smartphone applications and its impact on personal privacy.

https://preview.redd.it/ez9fp6o2mrr41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8321de6fea93331bdee6b452fb7f61a38c7d9960

### Tl;dr

Foundation for Media Professionals had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir on 31 March 2020. The petition was finally listed for hearing today i.e. 9 April 2020 before a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J. During the hearing, the bench issued notice and the matter will be heard next after one week. 

### Background

Foundation for Media Professionals had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir on 31 March 2020. The petition contended that the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 crisis violated fundamental rights to healthcare, education, livelihood and justice guaranteed by the Constitution of India. 

Despite the COVID-19 crisis gripping the country, the government has continued directing internet service providers to slow down internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G by citing security concerns. The most recent of these orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 was issued on [**03 April 2020**](http://jkhome.nic.in/22(TSTS)of2020.pdf) and it is due to expire on 15 April 2020.

2G is an outdated technology which was phased out in 2008 with the launch of 3G, and most modern websites and applications are too heavy to properly run on a 2G internet connection. While 4G internet services provide download speed of 150-300 Mbps, 2G internet services only provide download speed of upto 384 Kbps.

Due to denial of 4G internet services, healthcare professionals and ordinary people in Jammu & Kashmir have been unable to access the latest information about treatment and management of COVID-19 and relief measures. Further, patients are forced to flock to hospitals, which are hotbeds of infection, to consult doctors about COVID-19 and other ailments. This is because 2G internet services cannot support telemedicine which requires video to visually examine the patient.

In addition to its impact on healthcare, the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir is also preventing children from continuing their education through online tools. Children in the region have already suffered major disruption to their education due to the communication shutdown and lockdown imposed on 05 August 2019 after abrogation of Article 370. The COVID-19 crisis has forced schools to shut down again after re-opening earlier this year.

The government has fully embraced use of technology to combat the pandemic and it has launched a COVID-19 dashboard, WhatsApp chatbot and contact tracing app to widely disseminate accurate and latest information to the public and track spread of the disease. However, at 2G speed, the people of Jammu & Kashmir may be unable to access life saving information through these tools. For instance, the WhatsApp chatbot responds to queries with text, infographics and videos but downloading images and videos is difficult without 4G internet services.

### Hearing before Supreme Court

During today's hearing, a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J. issued notice to the standing counsel of Jammu & Kashmir and listed the matter for hearing after one week. This was the same bench which had earlier decided [***Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India***](https://internetfreedom.in/scs-judgement-on-kashmir-communication-is-just-the-beginning/), which related to the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu & Kashmir on 05 August 2019.

Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi represented the Foundation for Media Professionals during the hearing and we are extremely grateful to him for his efforts. We would also like to thank the wider legal team comprising of Advocate on Record, Shadan Farasat and Advocates, Vrinda Bhandari, Jahnavi Sindhu, Gautam Bhatia and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay who worked on this petition. IFF’s Executive Director and Advocate, Apar Gupta was also personally present with the Senior Advocate during today’s hearing which happened via video conferencing.

273,Must Read : The plight of the Indian Farmer,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv88qa/must_read_the_plight_of_the_indian_farmer/,"A few hundred miles from South Asia's glamour capital: Mumbai, a new day is marked by the lifeless body of another Indian farmer dangling from a peepul tree by a noose. More than 200,000 farmers have committed suicide in the last decade in Maharashtra's Vidarbha alone, an area the size of Portugal in central India. However, being an admirer of only the beautiful, the middle class Indian and their news, is carefully sanitized of any mention about these starving, sun-burnt wretches that cannot even afford the diet provided to one commercial European cow. The Indian farmer is invisible in life and in death. Thus, while his ripe, turgid oranges reach the gentleman's table, this abomination of a human being vanishes into obscurity, thrashed and ravaged by a burden of debt as the content hungry Indian media looks at the shopping malls and celebrity gossip to fill their pages.

I do not intend to ruin the appetite of my fine, educated compatriots on this forum, by whining the demise of a two penny cotton, orange farmer from India, I am here to enlighten you all on the ways of making these useless deaths profitable: the Monsanto way!

In the 1990s, Monsanto, ventured into India with its variety of genetically modified cotton seeds: BT cotton. In this introductory episode, I would skip the illegalities of Monsanto's field trials in India for which the Indian supreme court suspended Monsanto's Indian trading rights until 2001.

Fast forward to 2002: Monsanto's agents start approaching Vidarbha's farmers about these BT cotton seeds (later known as suicide seeds). The seeds were expensive, but Monsanto had already arranged with Indian banks for huge loan provisions to farmers who agreed. The farmers were promised unimaginable profits from these super-seeds, mostly verbally. Most importantly, Monsanto's agents were nice, personable and they actually addressed the Indian farmers as if they were human beings. When you are nice to the poor, you take away their bargaining power. Unable to read or write, these gullible, uneducated farmers put their thumb-print (in lieu of their signature) on Monsanto's agreement and approached banks for loans several times their annual revenue. The loans were all approved without any hurdle. The farmer was literally on a joyride, for the first time in several generations.

In the eyes of the erudite, this was a picture perfect move. In one sweep, millions of dollars of public money lying in the local banks became Monsanto's money, riding on shoulders of half-naked cotton farmers of Vidarbha.

Then reality struck: the crops failed, they failed miserably. When the farmers approached the same agents for answers, the attitude was different from last time. The agents pointed the illiterate farmer, who is unable to even sign his name, to a clause built into page x, line y of the initial document. The clause redeemed Monsanto of failed harvest unless the farmer had also bought Monsanto's very expensive fertilizer and pesticide as well. The news broke as hellfire on the destitute farmer that was already on the brink of devastation from three failed cotton harvests. There was no way for the farmer to afford these expensive fertilizers and pesticides.

Obviously, when the farmers approached the banks and local politicians on Monsanto's payroll, both referenced the same documents with the thumb print of the farmers and held the farmer alone responsible for their debt.

If you have decided to read on, let me warn you that there is no silver lining.

Until now, after each harvest, the farmers would save their indigenous seeds in local seed banks, but they have not sown indigenous for past several harvest cycles. So the older variety of indigenous seeds that the farmer sowed, are no longer to be found and worse still: Monsanto has bought over all the local seed banks. 99% of cotton exported by India is BT cotton, the indigenous varieties are all but extinct. These were the same indigenous cotton varieties that once clad Alexander’s army, the ancient Romans and the Egyptian Pharaohs. The native Indian cotton that led Europe into a global exploration for trade routes and set forth the age of explorations - is all but gone.

At this point, the Vidarbha farmers give up the fight, decide to swallow their loss and make the best of what they have. In the absence of indigenous seeds, they moved to sow the seeds from the previous Monsanto harvest. However, the friendly Monsanto agent came knocking back. The agent pointed again to another clause in the agreement that declares Monsanto's patent on the seeds and prohibits the farmers from re-sowing them. The farmer is flabbergasted, never before had they known that seeds can be patented. Farmer lobby groups took Monsanto to court. Obviously Monsanto prevailed.

Monsanto's victory over the naked starving Indian farmers was hugely celebrated in various disguise. Our very own Nature called it a ""boost for research"". 

The patriotic, nationalistic Modi government refuses to talk about farmer suicides. For several years, it refused to publish the suicide numbers. In Nov 2018 when a huge rally of Indian farmers marched to Delhi begging for their justice and relief, they were flogged and shot at by the Indian police, and not one mainstream Indian media covered the story.

The memoirs of Warren Hastings, the Governor General of India 1773-85, describes the Indian famine caused by atrocious policies of another multinational corporation: The British East India Trading Company (EIC). Starving farmers would come to the city in the vain hope of finding leftovers discarded by the opulent employees of EIC. Starving and diseased, the Indian farmers are an ungainly sight for three centuries now. As the British sepoy would kick these wretched souls lining the street side, the farmer would cry out in agony: ""Baba!, baba!"": ""father, father"","" your countrymen have brought me to such misery, if it pleases you, I want to breath my last in your presence"". Like yesterday, the common people is just as engrossed in fighting each other and rioting, to be able to see the real evil plaguing them.

My sister who is in shutdown back home with my family gets a text from her bank at 12:12 am that her account has been debited with a transaction for 4 lac rs. Upon checking her online banking we find out that its a online transaction for a e commerce website from the US - AAFES ( kind of like the army canteens in India)
Axis bank is completely unreachable through any of their channels - online chat, toll free number or even their fraud report portal.
The police though cooperative even past midnight were helpless and asked us to go to the cyber crime tomorrow morning.
Now here’s the situation-
My sister just lost a very large amount from her hard earned savings
The bank is unreachable 
Police have bounced us off to the cyber crime
And to top it all off, tomorrow is going to be interesting with all the restrictions because of the shutdown.
I know it’s a waiting game now, but just feeling helpless and frustrated.
Interrogated my sister and turns out she has not shared OTP or any other details, also we did not get any pre transaction alerts - so we don’t even know how the scammers pulled this off. Also, they shopped on a website exclusively for US army personnel. 
No idea how they did this, or what our options are, hopefully the bank will be cooperative tomorrow morning.
And for the scammers - no amount of expletives do justice to how low they can fall by stealing from others, especially in times which are tense and stressful enough. Seriously, who thinks this is a good time to steal ?
Anyway, rant aside, if anyone has any advice or helpful tips on how we can retrieve the money - please please let me know.

275,Call to consolidated action,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/funo60/call_to_consolidated_action/,"There are a few things that have become clear in the past couple of weeks of lockdown as well as the coverage of it around India and the central government's response:

1) India is headed in the same direction Spain is when it comes to Covid19, looking at the numbers it took us 8 weeks to reach 1000 cases, 4 days to reach 2000, and 2 to reach 3000+. The growth is indicative that we are going to see a massive increase in cases irrespective of whether we are in lockdown or not simply because the cases already existed prior to lockdown and now we are finally identifying the cases which have already spread prior to March 24th. the government is ill prepared, and it will show in the coming days, whether we like it or not. we will be losing more indians, we will be seeing more images of hardships being faced by the poor and by our healthcare workers.

2) the BJP has only gone and done it again and communalised the issue. we have somehow made this the tablighi janata outbreak and have pinned everything on that when there are massive clusters of people meeting in ayodhya or BJP ministers in the south holding pujas. my point isn't ""oh look at hindus"", it's the fact that religion is irrelevant and any sort of public gathering is detrimental to us. the Media and the BJP are only focusing on the muslims further propagating the narrative that this is something which they are spreading and portraying them as the enemy of the state. 

3) Subramaniam Swamy and his Vice interview have highlighted the BJPs agenda in a crystal clear manner. I have personally never voted for the BJP (including in 2014) as I was always aware of the RSS manifesto that drove their agenda and now we are finally seeing 90+ years of systematic, indoctrinated bigotry become fully a part of the central government's agenda. But what is truly horrifying is going through the comments of the Vice video and watching all these bhakts condemning Vice and telling them to ""stop with social justice"" and going ahead and justifying the BJPs agenda. the bots of the BJP have gotten exactly what they wanted through such a government, these sort of exclusionary policies are not outrageous to their base but are exactly the platform the BJP has run on since the Gujarat model. They are really out here partying like it's 2002. 

through all of this there is one plea i make of you, please hold your leaders accountable. when it comes to Covid, the one thing that is obvious is that this is only the start for India. Bhakts will have their reality check because as this virus spreads it is completely indiscriminate. it will affect them, it will kill their parents, it will kill their children, it will kill them, just as much as it could kill my family, me, your family, or a mUsLiM. as the number of infections and deaths rise in India, it is our duty to consistently hold our leaders responsible for acting. do not blame anyone else. not the tabhligi jamaat goers, not the ones who went to ayodhya, hold your elected officials accountable. they are making this a communal issue when this disease is going to kill irrespective of religion. 

i write this as someone with a lot of time on their hands but a lot of angst and anxiety in my mind because of the obvious direction this country is moving towards (Covid or no Covid). but this extraordinary time provides us with the opportunity to truly test our leaders and hold them responsible for the course our country takes. i honestly want to do a lot more and genuinely find an avenue to express this sort of discontent that is not just limited to like minded people like me. I know that places like reddit and instagram can be echo chambers in a lot of ways and i want to actively break out of that. 

If any of you share similar concerns but genuinely have ideas on how we can consolidate please message me or comment. we have the time and we have the modes, the one thing that the government cannot stop is a digital movement. the only point is we have to consolidate and act uniformly.

276,IFF proposes a three year moratorium on the use of Facial Recognition Technology in India,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fner6a/iff_proposes_a_three_year_moratorium_on_the_use/,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x3bo2g7l0do41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd839c97dce6580320de6163702f53c65ca7e868

**Tl;dr**

On 19 March 2020, we shared a letter with the Ministries of Home Affairs and Law and Justice requesting for a halt on ongoing use of facial recognition systems by both the central government and state governments. This is a response to recent statements by the Union Home Minister in the Indian Parliament of the use of such technologies in the investigations on the Delhi riots. IFF’s position on this front is informed by our own institutional work of mapping the deployment of facial recognition systems in India. In the letter, we also propose that the government impose a three year moratorium on this technology. In addition we propose the Government undertake a public consultation with various stakeholders in order to ensure that future uses of such nascent technologies remain fair, transparent and accountable.  


**The Problem with Facial Recognition Technology**

As outlined in our previous posts, [**use of facial recognition technology**](https://internetfreedom.in/facial-recognition-in-india-part-i/) in India is on the rise.  The Central Government and different State Governments have already started deploying facial recognition technology for two major purposes: Security/Surveillance and Authentication of Identity. At the level of the central government itself, multiple ministries are undertaking projects which rely on facial recognition systems. Moreover, they have allocated large amounts of public funds. These ministries include:

1. *The Ministry of Railways*
2. *The Ministry of Civil Aviation*
3. *The Ministry of Home Affairs*

As we have suggested in our [**blogpost**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/), use of this technology in a legal vacuum will lead to unprecedented and irreparable harms to the right to privacy. Here, we take the liberty to draw your attention to the Hon’ble Supreme Court's decision in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India which says that certain standards have to be met in order to justify intrusion by the State into the right to privacy. These standards are legality (existence of a law), legitimate goal/state aim, proportionality between the objects and the means adopted to achieve them, and procedural guarantees to check against the abuse of State interference. Laws with regard to FRT and personal data protection which can act as a legal safeguard do not currently exist in India.   


The implementation of facial recognition technology would also violate fundamental rights by facilitating mass surveillance. For instance, there will be a chilling effect on the right to freedom of speech and expression because people will be wary of being prosecuted in case they express anti-government sentiments. Further, the right to freedom of movement would be hampered as mass surveillance would allow the government to track the movements of individuals in real time across the country.  


Implementation of facial recognition technology in India has the potential of turning the country into a surveillance state. The problems that arise would not only affect the fundamental rights and civil liberties of individuals but also create mistrust towards any positive initiatives that the Government might undertake if no legal safeguards and best practices are put in place.  


**Recommendations made in our letter**

Taking into consideration how [**other countries**](https://internetfreedom.in/lessons-from-the-international-debate-on-facial-recognition/) have approached this technology and based on India’s experience with Aadhaar, it would be advisable to hit pause and contemplate the serious challenges that come with such an invasive technology. Retrospectively regulating an already introduced measure would be an extremely difficult task and would mean setting ourselves up for failure. Taking the lead in flagging this issue, we propose a moratorium of three years on the ongoing FRT projects in India.

Therefore, we are making the following recommendations:

1. Impose a **three year moratorium**  on facial recognition technology  for government projects.
2. Pass a strong data protection law with adequate checks and balances on state usage of facial recognition systems by both government and non-government actors.
3. Commence a public and transparent consultation where government, industry, civil society, human rights groups, academia and similar stakeholders have a proactive dialogue which can articulate a policy-making/legislative pathway on the issue. The conversation must be nuanced enough to differentiate between different uses of the technology which can span governance, monitoring, law enforcement, commercial, R&D, academia, healthcare, and many more unforeseeable domains.  


Under Project Panoptic, IFF will continue to keep tabs of these developments and work towards holding the Government accountable when they use such experimental technologies, which are so intrusive.

278,A Wuhan style 100% total lockdown all over the country + free ration distribution to dootsteps is the only way out of this impending crisis (in my opinion),https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fk5z8d/a_wuhan_style_100_total_lockdown_all_over_the/,"India has one of the largest population in the world, second only to china.

However, when Compared to China

* we have significantly weaker healthcare system

* we don't have the industrial base to produce essential material required for this crisis domestically. See Ventilators, pharmaceuticals and face masks

Right now, the situation hasn't gone out of  hands completely. However if the current trajectory Continues, exponential growth will ensure we will reach point of no return in a few weeks

In my opinion, we need to learn from other countries

* Declare a national lockdown all over the country. No one steps out of their house for any reason until the government specifies. Use all state resources to ensure strict lockdown. 


* Order all offices, organisations, public places shut until this emergency is under control 

* Issue a government law making it illegal for all private organisations to resume their work until the government specifies. Make it illegal to fire any employee or contracted workforce until this emergency is over. 


* For those who don't have any home, nationalise hotels and any other buildings which can be used to house the homeless people, until this crisis is over 


* Deploy the national disaster relief team and army to carry out door to door distribution of ration and water  to those who don't have money to buy food. This will ensure that people can stay indoors comfortably. 



* Nationalise all private hospitals and pharmaceutical companies until this emergency tides over. Until then, ensure all hospital care and medicines are free of cost at entry point for everyone. 


* Deploy the army to carry out testing and to  implement quarantine measures. Start mass testing on a war footing. 


* Temporarily release all prisoners who are jailed for non serious crimes like white collar crimes, robbery etc etc. Early release those convicts who were going to be released soon anyways. Indian prisons are extremely overcrowded. If infection takes a hold there, it will be a disaster for all the prisoners. 


* Stop all foreign  incoming traffic via air, ship and land to India. Seal all borders. Even those Indians who are currently outside should not be allowed to leave airport when they arrive. Isolate them until they are cleared as safe.


The window of opportunity is closing fast. Yes these measures will tank the economy completely for this quarter or even this year, but human lives are more essential then a few gdp points .

280,Covid 19 - Helping the most vulnerable around us,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fk9mhb/covid_19_helping_the_most_vulnerable_around_us/,"I was just forwarded something and it made me think. There are several of us who may have been offered to work from home, however, there is a huge population of workers out there who can’t afford to be at home. Especially, the ones that are barely just making ends meet - househelps, drivers, food delivery guys, rickshaw pullers, street hawkers, daily wage earners etc. How can we help these folks? They are not thinking about ration hoarding, sanitary needs, self quarantine. How do we help them?

The nature of disease is such that it requires social distancing. However, I do not believe this social distancing should dampen any humanity and the value of human connection. It should not turn us all into cold hearted panic stricken head less chickens. We need to think. We need to think for the most vulnerable and the economically impoverished.

India is not a western style country. We do not truly have a great social welfare system, and, even when government comes out with welfare schemes .. the distribution of these schemes is neither efficient nor effective. Given the cards we are dealt with, I sincerely believe that Covid 19 pandemic will cause more economic damage than anything else, and it’d be hard especially on the poor.

We need to center ourselves and collectively think about helping the most vulnerable ones. 

A small anecdote as I wind up - In 2005, when hurricane Katrina hit - there were stories of robberies in the houses and business properties. People acted on looting when they needed to be their best humanitarian self.

Whereas, almost every year when rain floods strike Mumbai, it is very well known and documented, that a lot of Mumbaikars help out people stranded in traffic due to floods.

I'm an employee of ESIC. Those of you who don't know about this organization please visit here:[ESIC](https://www.esic.nic.in/about-us) . ESIC provides medical and cash benefits to the insured employees and their dependants. It is a statutory body under Ministry of Labour and Employment, GOI. 
Now coming to the incident. This reporter named Jitendar Chouhan without having a basic knowledge about the department is barking like dog. The person who is said to be using fake id is the Medical Superintendent of ESIC Model hospital noida Dr Anish Singhal. He showed his card and this stupid journalist continued barking saying it's a card of an insurance company(ye insurance company nahi hai bewakoof).  He also mixed ESIC with EPFO. Even the police looked confused. These guys didn't even see the card properly. Even the non medical staffs have the same card. He doesn't even know about the organization with 100+ hospitals 8 medical colleges and more than 1000 dispensaries across the country. Such shameful acts by these journalists is really disappointing.

309,I realised (definitely just a bit of it) yesterday how creepy we Indian men are .,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/filcke/i_realised_definitely_just_a_bit_of_it_yesterday/,"This happened yesterday morning. I use a bicycle to travel to work. So en-route as I reached one of the traffic lights, there was this guy on some 4-5 year old splender idling his bike on zebra crossing.

I stopped some 1/2 feet  before zebra crossing. Now we we were the only two guys on that side. Some 15 seconds later a girl on activa stops next to me before zebra crossings.

Now this guy starts revving up his engine and started looking back towards his silencer as if checking that there is something wrong with his bike. There was nothing wrong - no black or white smoke. He was just checking out the girl. Then this guy slowly started reversing his bike and placed it before the zebra crossing between me and that girl and kept revving his bike for other 20 sec till lights turned green. 

Whille he was reversing and revving I had a feeling that he was doing this as a show-off. The girl and I happened to look at each other and her expression seemed to say ""yes I know what he is doing"" as if reading my mind.

As the light turned green they happen to turn in different directions and that guy might have followed her if they were going the same way, I relaxed a bit but it creeped me out.

I will not try to be holier than thou. I also checkout girls and I am sure girls also checkout boys - which is normal. But I do that very discreetly and never have been the one indulging in catcalling or someone who stares till the girl disappears in the crowd or ""ghar tak chod kar ayenge"" types.

It is normal to checkout individuals from opposite gender but catcalling and staring to make other person uncomfortable is not.

We Indian men need to understand this.


Edit 1:

Seems like this post has divided opinions.

A) Some people are shouting out about this post being generalising for all Indian men.

I want to make it very clear -

I pointed out the issue and not singled out the person.

 when I used the term ""Indian men"" I was referring to those who indulge in such attention seeking gimmicks. And if you do not do that I didn't call you out.

And if you are not satisfied now, then come let's nitpick the skin from hair. 

B) There are others who are taking the side of the other guy and are pointing out that it may just have been an issue with his bike.

Which is a fair point. But is based on presumption.
And for that I would say two things:


        1) I develop engines and can tell you if something is wrong with the engine. I am very sure everything was fine with that bike.



        2) This happened in chandigarh and if you have a idea about Gedi culture here you will know what such signals are meant for. And I know what that meant

C) Lastly, those who understood this thanks for trying to reason with others

**EDIT 2:**

This is getting out of hand

**To all the NOT ALL MEN brigade**


Hear me out and answer this honestly to  yourself (do not post here if your ego hurts).
Whenever you go out with your girlfriend, sister or any female relative of yours don't you always have to look out for male leching?

If you do not then you are living in a really good place my friend. But if you do that ,then what you are assuming is that all men will want to look at them. You yourself think that sub-consciously that ""All men will do this"".

And yet men like you are here trying to sound cool by putting forward an irrational argument that is essentially disguised form of saying I didn't do this.

Bihar government issued made it mandatory to have new pass issued from DM for new lockdown. The order was withdrawn as shown in the circular below as well as news clippings. My father had old pass from 1st part of lockdown since new one wasn't issued due to holiday yesterday and order being withdrawn by the government. Since government is so local police claimed traveling without Lockdown #2 pass is not allowed, hence the pass. 

My father works in bank and travels with his bike to work. Despite no problem other than minor stop and check during first phase of lockdown, he was stopped today and asked for pass and documents but even then Police fined him.

He was given 2 options  seizure of hi bike or pay challan. He paid the challan of course but fact remains he had necessary travel pass, a copy of government circular allowing his movement, his bank document.

If this is how so called ""essential workers"" are harassed, how will they do their work. But I shouldn't be surprised though given even doctors have been beaten, evicted and worse.

Hi r/India, using throwaway for reasons. I am a 24 y/o female working in a recruitment HR firm(**Gujarat**) . 

**TLDR: internet was out, so me and my colleague were working through our phones, i manage to find all the candidates for a job client, suddnely boss comes up, goes off about us lazing around not working. i fought back that he blindly can't just allege that we were not working. he tells us to give resignation letter and a apology letter for misbehaviour. i give the resignation letter, but was not budging for apology letter. he threatened that he would send my CV to gandhinagar(state capital) to ruin my career. i got scared and wrote an apology letter.. i dont know who exactly he would have sent this to at state capital.some sort of union? do i  have not options and just be beaten around with such foul powerplay? what are my options legally? and what can he do exactly as an employer/boss? i am a bit all over the place. i have to work till the end of the month. service my notice period right now.**

Ever since the start of my serving term here, i have been a victim of ***attempted*** bullying, but i have been firm enough to not get bogged down, and have been keeping him in check.

**Little workplace background**
Its a small HR recruitment firm which happens to be right on the second floor of his house. Comprises of the Boss himself, and two female employees including me.

This is my third month since joining.

**Couple incidents that took place below**

* I put the reporting sheet back on deck in his cabin, as i am walking out the cabin, he calls me back, and with condescension, he says, ""Do you not know why i hire female employees? because they are known to keep things organized, now unless you are a guy, i expect such tardiness from you. Or maybe you are a recently changed-to female from man? had your gender changed?""

* We do reporting every day at the end. My end time is 7 PM. Now I'd have my report ready, but the guy would quite intentionally would only start looking at reports at or after 7PM. And when i leave i am made to hear all sorts of comments that i am unprofessional/ or ""itni jaldi kyu hai ghar jaane ki"".. I mean i finished my shift what else am i supposed to stand for.

* I find all the possible candidates that i am asked for based on requirements, and pass them all off to him. When the company isnt doing well i am lambasted that because of me its not doing well, and he expects me listen all of that BS like a monk which i dont. it is upon him to further pass the profiles i sent him to the client company HR folks yet he 50% of the time never, infact half the time, he would walk down the stairs and have his luxurious naps in the afternoon. So as per him i am rude because i dont listen to him blasting me verbally for things i am not reponsible for.

* He keeps trying to get a little close, i once averted his random handshake because i found it odd, he tells me i dont what professionalism is, and then lately keeps asking my husband's salary i dont know why...

**alright back to the reason why i am making this post asking for help. story below**

319,Sad state of lockdown,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fo0doq/sad_state_of_lockdown/,"I'm just here to rant, feel free to ignore. I'm from New Delhi and my parent works in a bank as an essential services worker. They do not have the option to remain inside even though they want to. I've been staying inside the house for the past week even before the lockdown happened and have been preparing for the past few weeks.

Now with the metro shut, and the buses running at such a low capacity, it is near impossible for her(changing 2-3 buses at least) to reach the office which is about 9-10 Kms from our place. While going to drop her, we were stopped a couple times but since she had her ID, we were allowed the pass.

Then, coming back it was nightmare! Being a guy alone, I was stopped at every single checkpoint and was harassed even after explaining where I was each time. This somehow has to stop! Even showing the picture of her ID didn't work. Not everyone wants to go out, given a choice, I'd stay home and be happy isolated away from the fucked up world currently. 

It's understandable that they're out their protecting people, however, it doesn't mean they can do as they please. If someone is genuinely trying to explain their issue, they should be more understanding rather than showing the attitude where they just don't listen. Empathy isn't that hard but they show zero EQ whatsoever! People shouldn't be scared of them unless they're doing something wrong. It's the opposite though, for a normal person, being stopped by them is having a mini heart attack (maybe not that extreme but you know what I mean).

I'm afraid I'll get a fine/challan on my name even though I did nothing wrong and was only making sure the safety of my parent so she can help people like them to get their salaries on time! If the bank is closed, they will probably be the first ones to complain. Promoting digital India is a facade if more than half the population is unable to check their bank balance themselves! 

I suppose it doesn't really matter until it happens to a person themselves and only then they understand the whole situation.

321,Is the most pathetic thing about Hindu-Nationalists their subservience to White-Supremacists?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fwoat8/is_the_most_pathetic_thing_about/,"If you go onto right wing social media circles you find countless conspiracy theories that are pretty much copy/pasted from cesspools like Stormfront or /Pol/, many about how the “Soros” funded left wing media is unfairly critical of right-wing ideologies or how the mere existence “Radical Islamic terrorism” is justification enough to impose indiscriminate violence against Muslims. 

Under any one of Donald Trumps tweets you will find hoards of Indians venerating him and congratulating him for his policies against Muslims or celebrating his friendship with Modi. 

And the wave of anti-Chinese bigotry, perpetrated by racist whites in response to the coronavirus, has swept up India in such a frenzy that even Indian North-easterners are not safe from attacks and harassment due to having oriental features. 

There is such a innate desire for Hindu-nationalists to make sure that they are on the same side of every issue as white supremacists as both of them see their own community as being inherently better than the rest and therefore united in their contempt for the rest.

But the one key difference between the two groups is all of this ethno-nationalist bravado projected by the Indian government and its Hindu-nationalist supporters falls to the wayside when Donald Trump threatens retaliation against India for putting its own self interest before that of the white supremacists.

It’s almost as if they have accepted their status as being above the Chinese, the Muslims, etc but subconsciously they have accepted the rule of the white man over them. 

It’s not a surprise that over the course of his tenure, as India tries to contort and bend to appease him, Donald Trump treats India with almost a sense of restrained contempt. 

“For many years India has taken advantage of the US in terms of trade” - On trade

“If they were to disallow the drug from being exported to the US there maybe be retaliation, off course there would be retaliation” - On Hydrochloroquine

“And we're supposed to say, 'Oh, thank you for the library.' I don't know who's using it in Afghanistan” - On India’s role in Afghanistan

“ Our relationship with Pakistan is a very good one. Thanks to these efforts, we are beginning to see signs of big progress with Pakistan” - On Namaste Trump In Ahmedabad

“Tariff King"" - On India’s local industries

322,What if Money Heist was put in an Indian context?,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fztwca/what_if_money_heist_was_put_in_an_indian_context/,"This is totally how I think things would be different if Money Heist had an Indian backdrop 😀

1. The women in the gang would've already filed for sexual harassment, profanity and indecent behaviour even before the heist..

2. Moscow in his death bed would've revealed Monika was Denver's step sister 🤷🏽‍♂️

3. Professor starts taking class. The bitch Tokyo will already be messing since she hates Berlin and isn't in charge of the heist. Rio is terribly in love that he never listens to any class or keeps bunking classes and blindly listens to anything Tokyo says . Tokyo plans a riot against professor and Berlin. The plan is ruined. 

4. The female hostages would demand a separate accommodation.

5. Don't even think of the hostages changing to jumpsuits scene to be so smooth, everyone would demand a privacy 😁

6. Everyone, even after the 11th day would still have the perfect hair, makeup and those who have torn suits would have it in the right places to show off THEIR perfect biceps, abs  chest etc 😃

7. Also there would be atleast a 2 dream sequence songs.

8. Boman Irani would play Arturo Roman 

9. Their hideout during the 6 month training period would be in Leh/Ladakh or Darjeeling. 

10. Dali masks to replaced by that of BigB or Sachin Tendulkar.

11. And all this Smoking /Drinking and Abuse against women disclaimers.

12. After the success of Season 2. The role of Professor would be played by Salman Khan or Aamir Khan and Katrina Kaif or Sonakshi would replace Tokyo/Nairobi in the subsequent seasons.
Role of Stockholm would be reserved for a newcomer - Probably a Star Kid..Ananya Pandey or Jhanvi Kapoor?? Coz you need to reserve one for Nepotism!

13. Modiji would've gone for Demonetization 2.0, the day after the heist is complete. #MasterStroke

323,Questions to ask of landlords/housing societies ostracising doctors and other essential service providers,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fnz3q8/questions_to_ask_of_landlordshousing_societies/,"A follow up to the [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fnpztq/if_this_is_remotely_true_weve_failed_as_a_people/) about doctors and other essential service providers being thrown out of prevented from entering their home.

My question is, what is the remedy? 

* What are people, doctors or others supposed to do in case they face this harassment when going home? 
* Who do they call to report this? 
* What measures can be taken against the landlords or housing society officebearers for spreading this kind of hatred and panic? 
* What is the source of this panic besides 'infection will spread'? (If that is known, it can be resolved better.)
* What measures are to be taken by housing complexes or residences to prevent additional spread, especially ones which have residents who work in essential services? 

Most of these places are run by people who believe in unscientific whatsapp messages like thali-banging will drive virus away. These people won't listen to logic, so they need bullet points that they can be held accountable against those.

Please add any other questions which should go into this list.

Each state government should have the right to take a call on whether they want to extend the lockdown or not .

Even if they want to extend the lockdown ,instead of shutting down the whole state , only seal the hotspot areas . 

Extending a national lockdown will be  disastrous for everyone . Supply chains are completely broken . Government machinery has come to a halt . Many essential industries have frozen . People are suffering.

People are literally starving in their homes right now . The government is doing nothing to help those whose daily wages have stopped due to the lockdown .

The public distribution system has failed as usual . People who live in villages can't go to banks to take relief money from their accounts due to the lockdown . Many Indians don't even have a ration card , so they are not eligible for the government ration food.

The seasonal migrants are locked out of their homes and hometown . They have to sleep on roads , without food or money and often harassed by policemen .

What is the national lockdown achieving ? How can someone say with a pokerface that people literally on the verge of starvation is acceptable?

I am here to seek some advice on 2 events that are happening around me. First the more immediate problem(I will post about the other problem if it becomes more relevant).

I live in suburban Kolkata with my extended family. My uncle's wife is a Nurse.  A few days ago the hospital where she works had a coronavirus case. The hospital dismissed its staff for a few days for cleaning and sanitization and my aunt is one of those staff. 

For the last 3 days, a group of neighbors has been trying to coerce all of us who live in our house to stop going out. They contacted my dad who has been stuck in Assam thanks to an ill-planned office trip before the crisis and lockdown to warn my uncle to not come out. They also contacted the place where I take my food from to stop making my and my mom's lunch and dinner. My mom is incapable and thus I go to deliver her lunch and dinner every single day. Today morning(Date:8th May '20), there has been a mob of neighbors who came to threaten us to stay at our homes because they think we now have the virus as well.

These people were the same who proudly lit up candles on 9 minutes at 9 pm and also banged their utensils after modi's ""doctors and nurses and essential workers are heroes"" speech. Now they stand at our doors harassing and threatening us. They are also the same people who are breaking quarantine and walking around without masks and playing carom as groups on each other's roofs.

My uncle has simply told them that unless they bring municipal or police attested orders we don't have to follow anything they say. The situation has become quite tense and my aunt and some of the neighbors were screaming for half an hour today morning as I was attending my online college classes. The neighbors have told us to not even come out of our house for at least 10 days. I have been told to go live with my mom and they(one of the neighbors) would deliver the lunch and dinner for the next week.

327,Asking for potential ideas we can implement together virtually to support everyone fighting COVID-19 at the front lines in India.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fu3zap/asking_for_potential_ideas_we_can_implement/,"Hey everyone! I hope you're all doing well.

So, I am not sure if this is the right place for me to post this but I'll go on. 

With the increase in uncertainty and the harassment that the medical staff working at front-lines are receiving off-late, I was wondering if we could do/create something to convey our support, appreciation and gratitude to them?

I think it's heroic what they're doing and that they're not backing down or giving up on us despite the different forms of torments they're being subjected to. 
They definitely need all the support they can get, and since it cannot be done physically, I think we could do it virtually. The same can be extended to everyone who's working to keep us safe. 
Additionally, we could also spread some positivity during these trying times since it's just deaths, cases and false info. being blared on TVs and whatsapp messages.

So, if anyone has any ideas on how we can go about this, please suggest. 
I can draw and create digital illustrations and I am 100% ready to put these or whatever skills I can offer to support this cause. 

Also, I was wondering if we could create a subreddit similar to r/CoronavirusSupport but for India? 

Thank you for reading this huge wall of text. I appreciate any feedback, suggestions and discussions. Take care, stay safe and healthy.

329,"Confused, harassed, depressed, yet hopeful",https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fiykvq/confused_harassed_depressed_yet_hopeful/,"First of all, please excuse my English. It is a secondary language in my country. I (32M) feel lost in this world especially among my family. In 2014, my then gf blurted to her family about our relationship and was being forced to marry anyone else against her will. We (more like her) decided to tie the knot in a hurry and the next month of 2014 we were already married.

My (33F) wife is banker and somehow a totally different being than my parents (both 59yrs). From day one, they hate each other. Living under one roof with separate rooms worsened the scenario. It took a toll on our marriage as well and there were several weeks of zero physical contact between me and my wife. My parents like to talk things out while my wife likes the silent method of letting things resolve on their own. Two polar opposites. 

We (me and my parents) bought our new house in 2013 when we realised that the house we booked 14 years ago, did not take shape until 2019 when the construction commenced. Hence, have a large mortgage, soon later got married and then the unthinkable struck (me) - a series of perianal abscess episodes, surgeries, recovery and repeat  that lasted 3 whole years. 

In 2015, over a series of fights, my banker wife decided to take a promotion in another city. She wanted me to move out with her but my butt health had me sticking to my house. She's been supporting her parents and brother, both physically and financially. Her money, her choice! But, then she's stopped calling my parents altogether. They barely wish each other on their birthdays. She talks to me on a regular basis but it's usually a game of sarcasm. 

Thanks to the health crisis, I could barely sit at work the entire work day and due to 4 surgeries, one each year, my career is a mess. Once while searching for a new job, out of boredom, depression or pure horniness, I matched with a single mother and we had a NSA encounter.

Little did I know that the woman would go crazy over a dick and make my life a living hell. I clearly mentioned that I was married and was just horny. She agreed back then but stole my identity and later started living a fake life claiming to be my wife and claiming her kid of 6 years is mine. Like wtf! In India, laws are flawed. Women are queens here as they do not require proofs for complaints, their word is enough. Men on the other hand, despite proving that her documents are fake and that it was a casual encounter with facts on the table, I was repeatedly questioned by authorities for my own complaint of identity theft and harrasment over 3 years.

That woman has hijacked my life knowing that my wife does not stay with me. Blackmails turned frauds and no matter how much I've been pleading the authorities, the only answer I get is - If she wants money, ask her how much! Why should I give money to someone who agreed to everything and duped me later. Also, money is a scarcity with no medical insurance renewal thanks to the surgeries. 

In the midst of it all, I confessed about my wrong deeds to both my parents and wife. They were super pissed and my wife wanted a divorce. I wanted to end my life but I did respect her decision. Later, she told me that she loved me more than all the mess of this world and that she forgives but won't forget. We went back to being together but more like a long distance relationship of about 3 years now.

I just had my ""potentially"" last fistula and abscess surgery a week ago and recovery period is scheduled for 2 months. The harassing woman is a daily menace and has been reported across cyber crime, local authorities, but continues to threaten. My wife stays 400kms away in another city. My parents are burdened with the house expenses and I feel helpless lying with a torn butt waiting to recover.

The harassing woman aside, I do not know how do I handle my married life! I don't want to make a choice between my parents and my wife. I love them both. My parents think that I should divorce my wife and start afresh. I love my wife more after the heartfelt confession and talks we had about a couple of years ago. My wife wants to start a family of our own with kids and a new house. Truth be told, she does not contribute to any finances despite earning since over a decade.

I am not sure, if I can handle two (third being constructed) house expenses with a kid being planned by wife. Seems like a huge mess and no way out. I feel stuck, confused, harassed, depressed but want it all to sort out somehow. I could have hid the NSA encounter but it is a major goof up and I regret it.

Any suggestions on how to handle it all? I am lost dealing with pain on a hospital bed almost blowing my life's savings on my butt surgeries and recovery.


Tldr: Wife and parents don't get along. Wife stays in a different city since 3-4 years now and wants to start a new family when she returns to our city.

Makiko Kimura in her book The Nellie Massacre of 1983: Agency of Rioters writes that “150,000 armed men in uniform were in place to ensure law and order — one army man for 57 voters — turning Assam into a military battleground rather than a political state suitable to democratically elect political representatives.”

In 1983, during Assam election, the centre oppose the deletion of name of ""foreigner"" (people from Bangladesh who got citizenship in India). The All Assam Students' Union (AASU) opposed the inclusion of foreigners.

Even though talk between Indira Gandhi and AASU was inconclusive, the centre went ahead with holding election. The AASU protest to not hold election and due to this protest Hindu Muslim relation deteriorated, leading to Nellie Massacre. 

Reports from the Tewari Commission that conducted an official enquiry into the riots note that between January 1983 and March 1983, 545 attacks took place on roads and bridges, and over 100 kidnapping incidents were registered.

It said that 290 incidents of police firing and lathi charge — in order to curb the agitation — were reported in Assam.


In order to ensure security during the polling, around 65 battalions of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), along with several other forces, moved into the state.

However, the forces were not of much use as they were unaccustomed to the terrain, the locals as well as their language. They were forced to depend on the local police for guidance, who were hostile.

It started in a systematic manner in Borbori village on the morning of 18 February, 1983. Nellie and 13 other villages were surrounded by a mob armed with guns and machetes.

In the bloodbath that followed, over 1,800 people were reported killed while the unofficial death toll is as high as 5,000.

Two years after this masscare, Assam Accord was signed by Rajiv Gandhi.

340,"Is a logical, scientific study (and elimination) of the February 2020 ""Namaste Trump"" event as a Covid-19 spreader in Gujarat - possible in a calm & fair manner? [OC]",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gfpc5z/is_a_logical_scientific_study_and_elimination_of/,"Ahmedabad is under a strict lockdown - starting from 7 May (till 15 May, for now)

https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/coronavirus-in-gujarat-ahmedabad-under-complete-lockdown-as-covid-19-figure-nears-5000-whats-allowed-whats-not/1950809/

While there have been reports of how the city has attempted to adopt a [""South Korean"" model.](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-ahmedabad-adopts-south-korean-model/article31296758.ece) It's success or failure is debatable, at the moment.

Ahmedabad is among the seven cities that have recorded “high case load”, a term used by Niti Aayog CEO to suggest the city had been seeing high number of cases compared to others.

Undeniably, the Tablighi Jamat event in March, 2020 at Delhi was profoundly influential in the spread of the virus.

Our Government, our media & a large population of our society blamed the organizers & the participants - and rightly so.

Sadly, it spilled over beyond boundaries of decency & civility. People were hounded, treated inhumanely & vilified beyond all rationale.

Acts of defiance, non co-operation, violence by the very people that authorities genuinely wanted to help compounded matters.

While a large extent of that spread & the infection has been identified & controlled, it's true spread may never be fully known.

Nation-wide lockdowns were enforced since March 22nd with the express intent to contain & suppress the spread in our densely populated land. 

While implementation & execution of the lockdowns may leave a lot to be desired - it's deployment was undeniably a great idea. 

Had the people adhered to it & had the state & central government planned it ever so slightly better - it would helped save a lot more lives & substantially curb the spread of the infection.

But almost 50 days since the declaration of the lockdown - the situation across the country shows no concrete signs of improvement.

A point that is also highly essential is that testing during the early stages of the lockdown was very, very low - and the relatively high volume of it now is clearly highlighting the massive extent of the spread.

On the other hand, antibody tests aren't even being deployed at a large scale in our country - so identifying patterns, creating better containment strategies & [potentially using plasma therapy from survivors](https://www.indiatoday.in/newsmo/video/coronavirus-survivor-donates-plasma-for-treatment-1672636-2020-04-29) are not even feasible for exploration at the moment.

Which makes the relative lack of focus on the ""Namaste Trump"" Gujarat event an even bigger cause of concern. 

[Given the fact that earliest infection in America is widely considered to be in ***Washington*** in January 2020 - and assuming fairly that a huge part of Trump's entourage are indeed from the very same area.](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0121-novel-coronavirus-travel-case.html)

Hundreds of visitors arrived from America and were greeted enthusiastically. Locals too packed into the Motera stadium - and not before lining up the roads to greet the President's [massive motorcade for the 22km long roadshow.](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/news/namaste-trump-us-president-and-pm-modi-embark-on-22-km-roadshow/videoshow/74279722.cms)

With many states rumoured to be suppressing the full extent of their infections Goa, Bengal, Maharashtra, etc.) - could that be the case for Gujarat as well?

347,Holy fuck there is so much hatred and bigotry. Kapil Mishra the violent fanatic who started the riots and unleashed his extremist mobs to murder people has raised over 90 Lakhs but for Hindu victims only. Most of the victims of HIS mobs were Muslims but no such funds for them.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fl5mg7/holy_fuck_there_is_so_much_hatred_and_bigotry/,"According to the death  toll around 60-75% of victims are Muslims but they will get nothing from this. 

But people are donating for only one group and the campaign is being run by the violent terrorist who should be in jail. He is the scumbag who unleashed the mobs and now he has become the superstar. 

People are just lying and creating 100% fake news about how Muslim victim groups are getting money from ""Khan Market"" or whatever nonsense and so they will not give a single rupee to the Muslim victims of Kapil Mishra's Sanghi death squads. 

For example here. These two justifications for this are popular but based on complete lies. Of course Hindu Nationalists have no problem with lies. 

>While Muslim victims are being paid from Govt. treasure through Waqf board, there is nothing for Hindus. Great job Kapil Bhai.

>Salute sir is working for those poor souls who lost everything in #DelhiRiots & won’t get anything from #khanMarket funding

This is so enraging. The worst thing is complete lies they are making up that the Muslim victims don't need help because they will be taken of by the ""secular"" or whatever when this is not happening at all. And the man who started the riots directly has faced no consequences and is being treated as a savour. 

Imagine in America if someone was to crowdfund for ""white victims only"" in a riot where mostly black people died. 

The right wing in India is so much more openly monstrous and blood thirsty.

So there was an Indian 'girl' who added me on snapchat. Apparently she was married but like to talk to random guys. There's nothing wrong with this but she never verified that she's the same girl she claims to be. She never sent a snap (live photo). She always sent saved photos. When I called her out, she confessed she indeed was guy. The guy was sharing photos of his crush ( his good friend) and claiming to be her. When asked if she knows about this he answered in negative. I him to apologise to her and redeem himself but he immediately deactivated the account.

I have screenshots of chats and the photos that he shared. I have been trying to reverse search the images so that I find the girl and alert her. Reverse image search on Google and tineye hasn't helped.

So I thought of reaching out to the Reddit community. Does anyone know how I can find out who she is? He has tonnes of images of her. I'm not sure how got them but he has been misusing them.

388,The real loser in India's errupting Islamaphobia: Caste politics.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g76o5f/the_real_loser_in_indias_errupting_islamaphobia/,"TLDR: My (unqualified) opinion is that dalit political movement has seen the most erosion in the anti-muslim appraoch the government has championed.

Note: This post is for discussion. If you have nothing but belligerent responses that add nothing to the conversation I will report you. If you only have worn out, down over a thousand times arguments of being caste blind, having merit and anti reservation nonsense, I will be ignoring you. 

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, lets talk.

The anti muslim sentiment grows stronger even in lockdown, with the hindu right finding more ways to demonize muslims everyday. I didnt think it could be possible, but every day it seems they have a new angle of attack. 

And such it has been since day 1 i.e. the day the 2014 elections results came out when the muslim techie was murdered by a hindu mob and that mosque attack happened, I'm forgetting where. The very day of the results. Modi hadnt even taken up PMship that day. 

So to begin, Anti-Muslim rhetoric creates a unified Hindu identity. This is something that BJP has long worked for and was one of the goals of VHP, HM and RSS since their inception - create a Hindu identity that trumps caste indentity so that the caste status quo is maintained while killing any caste discourse. 

Now, I'm muslim. And I have no intention of blaming Dalits for the victory of BJP. Dalits, much like Muslims, have been promised much by politicians purporting to be their champions but delivery has been less than spectacular. Lalu's first term & Maywati's first full term withstanding, no government has been able to delivery upon their promises to their dalit and obc voter very much. So yes, I do not blame these communities for voting outside their 'champions', for 'fracturing' the community vote. 

But the fact remains that Modi's government has done spectacular work for the backward communities (barring muslims). We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal. From being called ""Congress + Cow"" it has been jokingly called ""Prakash Karat + Cow"". Such is the success of Modi's socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth.

But coming to the matter at hand, OBC representation in Parliament has been dropping and sarvana i.e. upper caste repesentation is increasing. Now, Dalits have reserved seats so while their count can not decrease, but this seat reservation is working against them. I'm going to copy paste directly from an article here to explain this

[Not a single constituency in India has more than 50 per cent Dalit population, which means it’s always the non-Dalits who decide the fate of Dalit candidates in reserved constituencies. A vocal or assertive Dalit leader has the least chance of winning from such seats. To be re-elected, a Dalit MP must be careful not to antagonise the non-Dalits, and one way of ensuring this is by remaining silent in Parliament.](https://theprint.in/opinion/17th-lok-sabha-looks-set-to-confirm-ambedkars-fears-no-vocal-dalits-in-parliament/232383/)

Note that Balasaheb knew this would happen. Which is why he proposed that non dalits not be given a vote on reserved seats. I am very much with him on this.

So who is the loser here? Mayawati has lost her base. There can be no doubt about it. The BSP+SP combine failed because SP votes were transfered to BSP but the BSP vote was not. Why? Because Dalits find BJP a more attractive proposition than BSP.  Who else? Lalu and Mulayam have lost a significant base altho this could be attributed to multiple reasons. It is also less significant because OBC leaders are many. Dalit leaders are few. 

While Chandrashekar 'Raavan' Azad has made a great big splash, he is being kept under hold by the government almost since day 1. He has the appeal to be a mass leader and present a large potential threat to the status quo. But he has been muzzled and jailed as often as was possible. 

Ultimately even the news cycles focus on muslim, and the caste conflicts happeneing everyday take a backseat, all the while forgetting that 85% of Indian Muslims are lower caste muslims. Here too, the muslim identity has trumped the caste identity and they are doubly the losers here considering that most muslim victim to Islamaphobic attack tend to be the under privileged and of backward caste.

This is all by design, mind you. The idea here is the same I mentioned earlier. Maintain caste status quo and the cost of caste identity. And its working.

Note that Modi himself never speaks about caste. Despite being an OBC he never mentions caste struggles and his own caste related experiences. So his being OBC does not bring more visibility to the problems of the oppressed castes.

391,Quora is full of hate !!,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fvwclb/quora_is_full_of_hate/,"Quora used to be my favorite platform back in 2014, mainly because there was so much new to learn and only those people were answering who actually had knowledge regarding the topic ( Professors, Scientists, Military Historians )

Now, it's full of hate speech, low-quality answers and cringeworthy questions like - ""What are some destruction level 100 tweets"" or ""What are some badass tweets during Covid-19"". It's filled with young Indians who have zero knowledge about the topic but don't hesitate to write their senseless opinions and comment hate. 

What's worse is the fact that a lot of people are openly spreading religious hate and trying to influence others regarding their beliefs. There are many right and left wingers who blame each other with childish comments.  Civil debates are non-existent and right-wing always finds a chance to blame non-Hindus and Liberals in almost every problem. 

My personal experience : 1) A guy literally wrote an answer saying Italians are victims of Coronavirus because they are liberals. A commentor on same answer even wrote that Italians deserve the suffering because ""they are leftists"". Both of them were Indians.

2) Many questions criticizing the government are quickly reported. Then those who don't agree with government's stance are put down as ""secular liberals"". 

3) One guy literally posted tweets from BJP Trolls in his answer and called them 'epic burn' and 'badass'. 

4)  Multiple answers ""completely"" blaming Muslims for Coronavirus ( Tablighi Jamaat should be blamed 100% but not the whole religion )

394,An honest introspection by ex-IAS officer on the state of our country today,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gogzo3/an_honest_introspection_by_exias_officer_on_the/,"THE LOCK DOWN DIARIES (VIII)--FEEL A LITTLE SHAME FOR THE LOST SOUL OF A NATION.

  This is not about the sorry exodus of millions of our more unfortunate brothers and sisters playing out on prime TV these days. It is not a piece about the government, or about politics or economics. It is neither critical nor sacerdotal. It is not about Mr. Modi or the Biblical scale suffering he has inflicted, yet again, on those who had put their trust in him. That is a matter between him and his Maker, and I hope the potter who moulded him can forgive him, for history will not. This is not about a callous Finance Minister with the rictus of arrogance stretched across her face. It is not about a judiciary which has thrown away its moral compass in the arid deserts of ambition and preference. It is not about a media which has struck a Faustian bargain with the devil and is content to feed on the offal flung its way. It is not about Rahul Gandhi or Mayawati or Nitish Kumar for they have already become irrelevant to the pathetic course of events unfolding.
  This piece is about me and the burden I carry, a burden of shame, that has been sitting on my back for the last few weeks and cannot be dislodged, no matter how hard I try. It' s a burden which just got heavier this morning when I read a post by an army officer describing his moving encounter in Gurgaon with families of ""migrants"" walking their way to Bihar, no footwear on the weary soles treading on melting roads, hungry and uncomprehending four year olds, of how they wept and tried to touch his feet when he gave them a few five hundred rupee notes.
  I hang my head in shame in the India of 2020. At belonging to a country and a society which exiles tens of millions from their cities, fearful of catching an infection from them, from a virus brought here, not by them, but by my brethren flying in from abroad. Of treating the hapless victim as the perpetrator. Ashamed of being a gullible cretin who swallows all the lies and half-truths churned out by a dissembling official apparatus. Of beating pots and pans as a servile hosanna to an uncaring presiding deity to drown out the sounds of tired feet marching to their distant villages.
  I can no longer recognise the religion I was born into, it no longer has the wisdom of its ancient sages and rishis, or the compassion of an Ashoka, or the humility of a Gandhi. It is too full of anger, of hatred, of violence. It has replaced its once lofty ideals with even loftier statues, caring deeds with dead rituals. It once fed the mendicant and the poor but now drives them away as carriers of some dreadful disease, without any proof. It even finds an opportunity in this pandemic to stigmatize other religions.
  I am ashamed of my middle class status, of many of my friends, colleagues and the larger family even. Cocooned safely in our gated societies and sectors, we have locked out our maids, drivers, newspaper man, delivery boy and a dozen others who have built for us the comfortable lives we now desperately try to cordon off from the less fortunate. We have deprived them of their livelihoods. We encourage another extension of the lockdown because our salaries and pensions are not affected. Our primary concerns revolve around resumption of deliveries from Amazon and Swiggy: the lot of the migrating millions is dismissed as just their fate- the final subterfuge of a society that no longer cares.

   I am ashamed of the thought processes of my class, of Whatsapp forwards that oppose any more ""doles"" to the hungry millions, that denounce MNREGA- the only lifeline the returning labour have left- as a waste of public money and food camps as a misuse of their taxes. I am ashamed that people like me can encourage the police to beat up the returning hordes for violating the lockdown, which, in the ultimate analysis was meant to protect ""us"" from ""them"". For the life of me I am unable to comprehend how we, sitting in our four BHK flats, have the heartlessness to blame sixteen tired labourers for their own deaths: why were they sleeping on railway tracks? How can one not be ashamed when I hear my peers decrying the expense of trains/ buses for the returning migrants, the costs of putting them up in quarantine, when they approve of their likes being flown back by Air India ? This is not double standards, this is bankrupt standards.
  I am ashamed of my social milieu which lauds the leader for dismissing the cataclysmic sufferings of almost five percent of our population as ""tapasya"", as if they had a choice. I am mortified to see the layers of education and affluence, the facade of civilisation being peeled back by a virus to disclose a heart of darkness in our collective inner core, the sub cutaneous mucous of hatred and intolerance for a minority community, contempt for the destitute. All age old prejudices, bigotry, racism and narrow mindedness have reemerged, fanned by a party which has fertilised their dormant spores.
  I am ashamed of the dozens of four star Generals and beribboned Admirals and Air Chiefs who  were quick to shower flowers and light up ships at a dog whistle from a politician but did not move a finger to provide any help to the marching millions. Did it even occur to them that they owe a duty to this country beyond strutting around at India Gate? That they could have used their vast resources and vaunted training to set up field kitchens for the hungry marchers, putting up tents where the old and infirm could catch a few breaths, arrange transport for ferrying at least the women and children?Their valour has been tested at the borders, but their conscience has certainly been found wanting.
  I am ashamed of our judges who have now become prisoners in their carefully crafted ivory towers, who had repeated opportunities to order the executive to provide meaningful relief and succour to the exiled wretches, to enforce what little rights they still have left, but spurned them at the altar of convenience.
  I am ashamed of our governments who have forsaken the very people who elected them, and are using their vast powers, not to provide the much needed humanitarian aid these disorganised workers desperately need, but to take away even the few rights they had won over the last fifty years. I am ashamed of a bureaucracy that uses a catastrophe to further enslave those who have already lost everything, which insists that illiterate labourers fill in online forms to register for evacuation, pay hundreds of rupees ( which they do not have) for rail tickets, produce ration cards and Aadhar before they can get five kgs of rice, all the while beating them to pulp. Of a Joint Secretary to government who can apportion blame for the infections by religion. This is not Orwellian or Kafkaesqe, this is a government gone berserk. How can one not be ashamed of such a soul-less administration, and of the people who commend its mistakes?

   They will reach their homes ultimately, those marching millions, minus a few thousand who will die on the way. They will not even be mentioned in the statistics: there will be no Schindler's list for them. And we will pat ourselves on our collective, genuflecting backs that one problem has been taken care of, the danger to our neo-liberal civilisation has been beaten back, the carriers have been sent away, the curve will now flatten. But the mirror has cracked and can never be made whole again. As the Bard said, the fault is not in our stars but within us. Or, as  delectably put by another great bard, one of our own who now belongs to the ""others"":

             "" Umar bhar Ghalib yahi bhool karta raha,
               Dhool chehre par thi, aur aina saaf karta raha.""

  Actually, this piece is not just about me- it's also about you, dear reader. Look into that cracked mirror. Do you feel any shame, just a little , for what we have become, for the lost soul of a once great nation?

395,Opinion : I think there is a reason why those with mental health disorders are feared and avoided in India and they are doing the right thing by hiding their disorder in this illogical society.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gea49o/opinion_i_think_there_is_a_reason_why_those_with/,"The reason is that no one wants to walk with a person who has stated that he has a mental health disorder and then get pushed by him under a moving bus or car or get pushed by him from a bridge.

Thats what most Indians percieve a mental disorder to be. They dont realize that there are mild disorders causing stress and anxiety. A person saying he has a bone fracture or some physical disorder does not carry any social harm with him. But a mental victim is percieved to be.

So my advice to those with mental disorders is to act as normal as you can in front of people. You are doing the right thing by hiding your disorder.

 PLEASE DO NOT BE HONEST WITH EVERY TOM, DICK AND HARRY IN THIS COUNTRY. Dont be honest about your disorder even with those who look compassionate as compassion can be faked. Be honest only with the guy who can give you medical support (doctor) and the guy who can give you financial support (your father)

 If you are jobless because of it and nosey people ask you what do you do, tell them [""I love dance/music/football"".](https://www.theminimalists.com/do/) Tell them your passion and brush these useless and selfish burdens of society away from you. You dont need them. I call them burdens because most of them ask these questions for their own greed , contacts and ego, not to help others. Such people should be talen very lightly and ignored instantly.

399,Women in India with 31 fingers called a witch throughout her life.,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fjj42g/women_in_india_with_31_fingers_called_a_witch/,"Life becomes unbearable without the love and affection of the family members and the belongingness of society. Unfortunately for KumariNayak, a 63-year-old woman from the Ganjan district of Odisha, her life has been a humiliation because she has Polydactylism.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/se8pqngcm0n41.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a05d1d9821b72ee428b88ec5d46e8bd0b2a717b

Polydactylism is a defect in the body where the person suffers from abnormal growth. In the case of Kumari, she was born with 19 toes and 12 fingers by birth. Her life was made miserable by this disease as, since childhood, people used to keep their children away from her and call her names. 

Kumari said in an interview: ‘I was born with this defect and I couldn’t be treated as we belonged to a low-income family. ‘

As she grew old, things turned even worse as she was called a witch by her neighbors. She feels terrible by such remarks but is helpless as she cannot get herself treated and can’t fight a long battle with superstitions. Therefore, she keeps herself indoor to avoid bitter words.

It has now been 63 years that I have had this condition. She said in the interview, ‘The residents nearby, who are too much into blind faiths, believe that I am a witch and keep away from me. They sometimes come to see my condition – but never help. ‘I am forced to stay indoors as I am being treated differently, which is not a nice way of treatment from my neighbors.’

One of her neighbors, who understands the medical condition of Kumari, often comes to help her, but even she said that the mentality of people in a small village is such that they think of everything in terms of good or bad, god-like or witch. And, Kumari’s medical condition has made her the witch of the village.

On hearing Kumari’s situation, government officials of India have decided to come to her aid. She is granted a house and monthly pension so that she can live a life of dignity. Even measures are taken to stop murders of women in the pretext of witch-hunting and black magic.

In 2016, there were 135 cases registered of murder and lynch mobbing to curb black magic. Even though the government of India is taking measures to curb such heinous acts, but the administration feels the efforts on the ground level are not adequate, and mass awareness needs to be spread about such diseases. 

Let's hope stricter laws are passes, and victims of such diseases are also considered humans and give their share of respect in society.

403,Indian Working Class and Social Murder,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gga7x6/indian_working_class_and_social_murder/,"The past month has been absolute hell for India’s working class. Over 40 days of joblessness, homelessness, poverty, hunger, and endless travelling in this heat. States relaxing and quashing labour laws left, right and centre. The government spending crores on theatrics and bringing back privileged Indians via air, while the backbone of our country get trampled on and are treated like filth. Two gas leaks and a boiler explosion in a single day. Hundreds of children with bleeding feet and hoarse voices walking either to their homes or to their deaths under the scorching sun. They don’t get dignity even in their deaths because people’s first reaction is to mock them for being on the railway tracks in the first place. At a time like this, there is no better way to describe the situation than by using Friedrich Engels’ concept of social murder.

“When one individual inflicts bodily injury upon another such that death results, we call the deed manslaughter; when the assailant knew in advance that the injury would be fatal, we call his deed murder. *But when society places hundreds of proletarians in such a position that they inevitably meet a too early and an unnatural death, one which is quite as much a death by violence as that by the sword or bullet; when it deprives thousands of the necessaries of life, places them under conditions in which they cannot live – forces them, through the strong arm of the law, to remain in such conditions until that death ensues which is the inevitable consequence – knows that these thousands of victims must perish, and yet permits these conditions to remain, its deed is murder just as surely as the deed of the single individual; disguised, malicious murder, murder against which none can defend himself, which does not seem what it is, because no man sees the murderer, because the death of the victim seems a natural one, since the offence is more one of omission than of commission.

**Tl;dr**

According to a Hindustan Times [**report**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/pegasus-creator-nso-group-has-a-covid-19-software-why-you-should-be-worried/story-SMsYXKFoz9OPG2VBIKrA8L.html) dated April 07, 2020, the NSO Group has created a surveillance application to track COVID-19 infected patients which they have been actively pitching to almost a dozen governments around the world to use. This is the same company which was behind the Pegasus software that was used to hack the Whatsapp applications of a substantial number of Indian citizens mainly journalists and human rights activists in May and June of 2019. Mindful of the potential harms of this COVID-19 application being used by the Indian government, we wrote to the Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh urging them to establish committees to investigate the Whatsapp hack. Our key recommendations were to include victim and expert testimony in the investigation which should be carried out in a transparent manner.   


**What happened?**

Last year on May 14, 2019, an [**article**](https://www.ft.com/content/4da1117e-756c-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab) published in the Financial Times for the first time reported that Whatsapp, “discovered that attackers were able to install surveillance software on both iPhones and Android phones by ringing up targets using the app’s phone call function.” As per a statement by Whatsapp, this vulnerability was patched and closed. On October 30, 2019, Indian Express published a [**report**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/whatsapp-confirms-israeli-spyware-used-snoop-on-indian-journalists-activists-pegasus-facebook-6095296/) containing statements made by Whatsapp which confirmed that the victims of the hack in India were mostly Indian journalists and human rights activists. Of these a significant number are situated in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh as the hack targeted lawyers related to the Bhima-Koregaon case in Maharashtra and Dalit activists in Chhattisgarh.   


**What is the law related to hacking?**

Surveillance such as this which was carried through the Pegasus software developed by the NSO Group puts the personal and informational privacy of citizens at risk. This goes against the decision in J*ustice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India* which affirms informational privacy as one of the facets of the right to privacy.   


Additionally, the Information Technology Act, which deals with interception of data, expressly prohibits hacking. Under S. 66 of the Act, hacking is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees or with both.  


**Attempts at reputation laundering by the NSO Group**

We are bringing this up again right now because we are especially concerned about the operations of the NSO Group in India. It was reported in the Hindustan Times on April 07, 2020 that NSO has now developed a surveillance app to track the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The report also said that the NSO Group  is “actively pitching surveillance tools to their governments and to others around the world.”   


It was not made clear whether NSO has approached the Indian Government. However, since the NSO Group has already been accused of illegal surveillance, privacy experts are of the opinion that the company might try to exploit this crisis to market intrusive systems. [**The coronavirus pandemic presents a golden opportunity for corporate actors  like the NSO Group to recast previously unpalatable behavior as life saving intervention.**](https://theintercept.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-covid-19-surveillance-privacy/)  


**Our recommendations**

1. We recommend that the State governments of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh should establish an investigation committee to look into the hack committed in their state.
2. The Committee should have a fixed timeline in which to complete its investigation and submit its report to the State governments.
3. The Committee should allow for the victims (or legal counsel on their behalf) of the hack to testify before it.
4. The Committee should allow experts in the field of data privacy to testify before it.
5. The Committee should facilitate the registration of open FIRs and encourage that investigations are commenced immediately.
6. The Committee should operate in a transparent manner.
