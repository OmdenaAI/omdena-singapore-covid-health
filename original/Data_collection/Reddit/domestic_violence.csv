0,0,[serious] heads up kinda controversial: As much we talk about male privilege we don't talk enough about female privilege,1,fk8nn7,gender,https://www.reddit.com/r/gender/comments/fk8nn7/serious_heads_up_kinda_controversial_as_much_we/,2," 

As much stated above. I am not saying we have no male privilege or close to it. I am just saying how we aproach things in society right now i feel we talk less about female privilege.

First these examples will make sense as obvious but stating them cause I believe they stem from privilege. And imo the way we approach them and solve their respective points should me also discussed. And some of these examples i will give are those i feel have not discussed and should be on the table.

Child custody It will differ where you live but generally it's so much harder for men to gain custody of a child than a woman. Even if the man can prove the woman are actually the cause of the divide. this goes also that it is usually assumed the man are violent. Of what i researched most that comes upp focused on male violence towards women, which i don't want to discredit or make it seemed biased but from an outside view it seems weird. And i would love for especially women if you are willing give me hindsight on this point

Physical harm. I am not stating there should be exceptions and men do hit woman or worse assault them and so on. Here mean more of a societal privilege. If woman hit or assault men they look like freaks and not real mean. Can extend to family termoil and even if people refuse to often acknowledge rape on men or female assault on men.

Speech privilege, when a man talks over a woman they are often seen as petty, arsehole so on. But when roles are reversed it seemed as powerful talk back to the man kinda thing. I can kinda understand where this stems from but to me it feels like a stupid double standard. NO ONE i mean NO one should tolerate anyone speaking over somebody else. Can we not make this about an gender issue instead of a people issue.

A quick and low ball, allot that concerns to childcare and pregnancy. Which some are natural and I have no problems with just add it here cause it technically counts as multiple different types privilege.(iam willing to talk and learn more about these types of issues so again would women please lecture me about this i am willing to learn from you)

lastly this one goes in childcare but i want to focus on this one, child support. Before you get your panty in a twist i am not saying this should go away. But how certain women not the majority can and would exploit it for their own benefit. Sure i can understand if two adults with consent have sex woman gets pregnant and have no other support. issue is if a woman either lies being on pregnancy pills or any other forms of birth control, makes a hole on the condom where the guy is unknowingly is having sex with any risk why should accountable for helping the mom. this is what i feel should be talked about how to stop this sensible law be abused.

I am not stating male privilege is better or worse than female privilege. I just want an honest conversation about female privilege cause I see it more often that women champion against male privilege instead of tackling or completely ignoring their privilege.",1584492967.0

üì∑

In 2019, *The College Fix* reviewed more than 700 bias complaints from nearly 20 universities across America. The reports were lodged by students and others on campus with bias response teams that have proliferated at colleges and universities across the nation in recent years.

Students, faculty and staff are encouraged to report alleged bias that they witness or experience to campus authorities, who then offer counseling, investigations, educational interventions ‚Äî and sometimes even ‚Äúrestorative justice‚Äù measures ‚Äî to resolve the matters.

*The College Fix* obtained the complaints, which date from fall 2018 through fall 2019, through public records act requests, and names had been redacted. But what the reports illustrated is that these bias response teams have become glorified tattle-tale systems in which campus administrators are alerted to the slightest offenses and hurt feelings.

Only about 15 percent of the 700 or so bias complaints *The College Fix* reviewed could be construed as legitimate concerns that should have actually been registered with campus police, such as stalking or threats of violence.¬†

5,5,The Spectacle that is Jenner,6,396yhq,gender,https://www.reddit.com/r/gender/comments/396yhq/the_spectacle_that_is_jenner/,3,"By Helen Hill MA MFT

The ‚Äúcelebration‚Äù of Caitlyn Jenner (noticeably, spelt without the signature Kardashian ‚ÄúK‚Äù) that
took place on the recent cover of Vanity Fair had enormous potential to open minds, alter perceptions, and glaringly challenge the status quo of what it means to be a ‚Äúman,‚Äù a ‚Äúwoman,‚Äù and that mysterious third category‚Äî‚Äútrans.‚Äù And yet it did not. Not only did it not live up to its potential in breaking societal male/female constructs, but it came strikingly close to a celebration, not of Caitlyn Jenner, but of the 1950s female pinup archetype.   (It seems not a coincidence that the Jenner Vanity Fair cover looks astoundingly similar to a 1950s Playboy bunny.  See this link for a comparison side-by-side image: https://helenhill.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/jennerplayboy_pe22.jpg)  Or, as we know it, what some sexists (both male and female) in Hollywood think a woman ‚Äúshould be.‚Äù Why am I not surprised? Jenner, Vanity Fair, and the business that is the Kardashian family is, at its core, pure Hollywood.  And that, in itself, should be a concern.

To me, the Caitlyn spectacle is currently no more than a Hollywood-celebrity-guy becoming a Hollywood-celebrity-girl whose ‚Äútransformation‚Äù has played strongly to rigid gender and sexuality stereotypes standard in the Business, and whose femininity was oversexualized by a magazine catering to a traditional celebrity aesthetic. And I am shocked at how easily some applaud the pursuit of extreme stereotypes of gender as some kind of reflection of the acceptance of transfolk into the greater culture.  It seems that, in America, as in Hollywood, image is truly everything.

There are thousands of transfolk whose body types don‚Äôt fit the ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù much less the celebrity-desired aesthetic. These people have not been offered TV shows, high profile interviews, or thousands of notes of support. Far from it! These people have faced rejection over and over and over again; they have lost jobs, housing, health care, families, neighbors, religious communities, and more because of their departure from ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù   Many have lived homeless despite having PhDs or other graduate-level degrees, highly-sought after skills, and excellent ethics and work habits.  Coming out as their true selves put them in an ‚Äúuntouchable‚Äù caste to be ostracized and set aside.  It cost them everything.

So many paid dearly. I paid dearly.

Most of all, my children and my ex paid dearly.

In other words, the people I love most paid the highest price for me to finally face myself and become a real human being, and, hopefully, a kind and decent one too.  And it is on me to honor them by working hard every day to be that good and loving person they believed in when I didn‚Äôt believe in myself.  I can never tell you what I owe them.  They are truly the best part of me.

I am one of the lucky ones. I can put a roof over my head. I have some friends who love and accept me. I don‚Äôt ask for much, just please don‚Äôt hurt me.

But seeing how willingly young men and women accept this celebrity culture aesthetic and ignore the rest of us who don‚Äôt fit it, leads me to believe nothing has really changed.

With this new Caitlyn media craze and the related information and perceptions (and misinformation and misperceptions) now inserted into our cultural discourse, I and other ‚Äúnormal‚Äù transfolk have to again confront our own ideas of gender and how we manifest our gender in this world. I question myself to make sure I am me. And I strive to express myself safely so that I am not harassed, bullied, jobless or homeless.

As of now, everything I‚Äôve seen about this messy business with Jenner is about adopting extreme gender roles‚Äîfirst as the ultimate male (Olympic champion), and now the ultimate female (sex and glamour). Someday Jenner will figure out what is really the best manifestation for herself. It almost seems as if it is a caricature, a set of extreme ideas of gender being manifested.  It seems unreal and I cannot relate.  The celebrity trans norm cannot help promote safety and security for ‚Äúreal‚Äù transfolk without the cadre of supporters or the backing of millions of dollars. But then again, this transformation was about Bruce and Caitlyn. It was not about me or you.

Jenner could not be where she is without the fact that thousands of us have gone before, without fanfare, without support, and without acceptance, must less tolerance.  We‚Äôve trudged through when it wasn‚Äôt popular, newsworthy, or safe.  No awards are given to those of us who have survived horrific conditions to build our lives anew.  But then again, we weren‚Äôt looking for any.  It is the height of irony that Jenner is receiving an award for what thousands of transfolk have done for years, and continue to do, sacrificing everything in the hope to live in quiet and simple dignity.

Transfolks continue to be bullied, harassed, sexually assaulted, and murdered.  Even this week. None of what Jenner is doing, nor what the celebrity culture is promoting, has or will change that, in my opinion.

In all of this, the celebrity class divide has remained such a chasm that Caitlyn and her supporters still don‚Äôt see the rest of us, must less muster any empathy or compassion for our plight. Where are our voices in all of this? Where is the support? Where is our story?

As of now, it seems that Jenner and Hollywood haven‚Äôt changed a damn thing about gender stereotypes. And that they may have done more harm than good with the sexualized Vanity Fair spread.

I would ask that, and continue to have hope that, as time goes on other trans celebrities or leaders will welcome the monetary and emotional support that they receive and give it back to the cause and their peers who are still suffering deeply each day. Donate photoshoot fees (I‚Äôm speaking directly to you, Ms. Jenner) to clinics, housing services, job advocates and other services that reach out to those transfolk who do not fit gender stereotypes and who are not welcomed by society with open arms. Do your part to help those who helped pave the road before you. Be a good and kind girl, guy, man, woman, trans person. Honor all humanity.",1433903085.0

I have a theory, which might be wrong to explain it.

For centuries, women have legally and socially been regarded as the private property of their father and husband primarily, and the public property men more broadly. In the past century women have struggled for individual rights like the right to vote and fair employment, so the status & dignity of ""the individual"" would be extended to women, not just contained to men. The struggle for abortion rights is the best example of this as the core argument was all about women's autonomy and self-ownership of their body (self ownership as an idea goes back to Locke). Then came struggles against rape, which included criminalizing marital rape & changing how the law viewed rape which for a long time was viewed as a crime against the husband or father, not against the woman herself. The campaigns against sexual harassment & domestic violence also follow from this principle. These developments perhaps helped shape women's consciousness of themselves as autonomous individuals with rights & dignities.

We live in a liberal individualistic society, more so than in the past, that values privacy, personal space & autonomy (Anglo-Americans aren't well known for being ""touchy feely""), yet women have long been denied this, while men go to awkward lengths to respect personal space among each other (partially the ""no homo"" thing). But all women want is to have these same considerations respected. Whereas the previous struggles were against women as ""private property"" in the home. These recent struggles like #MeToo etc are in a way against women as ""public property"" who random men feel they can inappropriately touch, hug, kiss, grope, stared at, intruded upon without consent. They want to be treated with respect with the same personal space considerations accorded to men derived from the dominant liberal individualist framework.",1589581109.0

Any further questions anyone has I'd be happy to answer but my main question is, what do you do when traditional methods of healing childhood trauma dont work? 

I have been abused and neglected since I came out of the womb. That statement within itself is no joke. I am the result of a drunken one night stand my mother had with a friend. She has very bad substance abuse issues which have ranged from drugs and alcohol since she was 13...

My mother heavily neglected me as a baby. From what I've been told by family members in the past she use to pass out on drugs/alcohol for hours on end and leave me in my cot screaming for hours, hungry, soiled in my own crap and shivering cold until I started turning blue. 

I was beaten, locked in cupboards, neglected emotionally, physically. Sexual abuse from family members started when I was 4. I was constantly put in dangerous situations from my mother. Shed drag me for full days spent at pubs from morning until the pub staff would tell her to take me home because it was so late and I was falling asleep at the tables. If she didnt want to leave shed lock me in the car and continue to drink until she was ready to leave. 

I was constantly subject to her abusive relationships with men and women. We never stayed anywhere more than a year because shed constantly destroy any relationship shed have with family/friends/partners. I'd witness and get involved in her physical altercations with people. Witness drunken violence by her and whomever she was with. I've never had a stable home ever and I've never known what it's like to be loved and cared for by a loving family member. 

My mother would abandoned me at random peoples homes for sometimes weeks on end to go and party. They'd have to call the police to try and find her. Shed get some mothers at the school I was going to, to take me in because she couldnt take care of me. This type of crap happened constantly. 

I have 2 aunts and 1 grandmother. All of them knew from day dot what she was subjecting me to but none of them ever did anything about it. No one contacted the police, no one called to check if I was still alive, no one offered to take me in. When I finally was taken off of my mother by the state 1 aunt offered to take me in, but unfortunately her husband was my sexual abuser (uncle) and I couldnt knowingly go into her care whilst he still lived there. I came out to my aunt after many years and told her what he had done to me as a small child and I couldnt live with her because he would have started raping me if I did. However when my aunt was having marital troubles, both my grandmother and other aunt took my cousin in! They treated her so differently to me. I never fully understood why they'd take my cousin in and not me. 

When that information about my uncle came out I wasnt believed by ANYONE in my family. I was shunned, hated, and rejected by each family member. This is what hurt me the most. This is where most of my trauma lies. The people who where suppose to love and protect me instead constantly did the opposite. 

The rest of my life up until 18 I lived in state care being taken care of by people who couldnt necessarily give a shit about my emotional wellbeing. Being pushed from home to home. Never knowing real family or real love. I've experienced sexual abuse from 4 all the way up until this year by random men. Men I thought I could trust. Men I'd known for years. 

When I'd tell my friends and even my partner at the time what happened to me that I'd been assulted by a mutual friend of ours, I was the one who had fingers pointed at me. I had people trying to poke holes in my story, ask if I had done anything to warrant it. I lost alot of friends, however the mutual friend goes untouched. My partner at the time even resumed his friendship with the guy who assulted me. 

I've constantly been abandoned by family and friends. People treat me like a revolving door. They come, take what they want and leave. I'm at a point in life where I have my guard up massively. I'm extremely sceptical of anyone who enters or re-enters my life. I've been single 3 years now and I'm frightened of men. 

I've spent near my whole life trying to heal this enormous amount of hurt I've been through. I've done it all. Ive tried to confront the people who've hurt me. I've written letters and burnt them. Therapy. Talking to my inner child. Thinking over and over and over and accepting what's happened to me. But here's the thing... none of it is working... I'm still left with the pain of what's happened to me... what am i doing wrong? I've followed all the rules on how to heal hurt... but it just wont go away... 

Will I have to live with this forever? 

I'm sorry it's such a long story and thank you for reading through it if you did. I still could put 1000 stories of the horror I've lived but obviously there arent enough pages to write it on... 

How did you heal from any trauma you've been through? I dont blame myself for what happened and know I'm worthy of love and care just like anyone else but why does it still hurt?!",1589743933.0

Or are the crimes of rape and sex abuse of women sort of a separate category of offending--meaning a two-track policy can be pursued: 1) Lenient response to most forms of crime and 2) Harsh treatment of rape offenders, including long prison terms.

138,138,Small town story on sexual violence,23,1cd7az,women,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1cd7az/small_town_story_on_sexual_violence/,5,"Men and women of reddit, I would like to tell you a story.  This is no throw away account ‚Äì this is for my cousin who is not a redditor, but has something important to tell.  He comes from a small town in the North where there is only about 1000 people.  Hobbies include hunting, fishing, sports, and beer.  Most don‚Äôt head to college.  Most don‚Äôt have any real understanding of the actual world.  Reddit, I present to you the story of ignorance.


About a month ago, a few speakers (all female) came into my small high school to talk to us about sexual violence.  They came from a city a few hours away, so they knew really nothing about us and we all laughed at their surprise when the whole senior class fit into a normal sized classroom.  There‚Äôs only 37 of us.  They went through the how are you, are you ready to graduate, and then who is going to college,  I think about 15 raised their hands.  Most of us are going to small colleges that we got into because it lets everyone in, except a few of us are going to bigger, better things.  You know, the few that get to finally get out.

Anyway, they start their presentation.  Fancy powerpoints with sad videos and facts.  Most of us take out our phones or draw or pass notes, a couple do homework and me, I listened.  It was interesting I guess, but to be honest I thought one of the ladies was really pretty, and I liked her accent.  After awhile one of the ladies goes into talking about how far is too far.  They show another video, it has a girl and a guy (both very intoxicated) and she‚Äôs saying no.  He doesn‚Äôt stop, she starts crying, and a guy comes over and forcibly makes him stop.  Woo, that drunk girl dodged that one, huh?  At least that‚Äôs what it seemed to imply.  They stopped the video, and began discussing how far is too far.  Once finished, the smartest girl in our class (I mean actually smart, not small town smart, she‚Äôs going to a huge university) raises her hand.

She asks, ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, why aren‚Äôt we going to discuss how far is too far when a guy is drunk?‚Äù

I mean, she posed a reasonable question.  I didn‚Äôt realize it at first but yeah, they‚Äôve only discussed how a guy can know (and a 3rd party could see) when a girl wants the guy to stop.  

One of more popular guys (for a class of 37) laughed and said, ‚ÄúWho are you planning on giving your v card to?!‚Äù

It got a lot of laughter.  At that point, if I was her, I would‚Äôve probably shut up but she was persistent, the damn smart ass.

She again addressed her question to the ladies, ‚ÄúCan we discuss this?‚Äù

At that point I think they had lost their voice or something, because that guy got his voice in sooner again, and he said ‚ÄúNo need, I‚Äôll volunteer to be your toy‚Äù

Again, a lot of laughter.  Now I‚Äôll admit that I should‚Äôve stood up for her, but I didn‚Äôt say nothing.  I didn‚Äôt laugh, I just sat there.

I think the ladies finally got their voice and one said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the same for men, when he says no.‚Äù  

The popular guy laughed at that, speaking even more loudly, and said ‚ÄúA guy would never say no to sex.  Especially not from you‚Äù he said directly at her, with a wink.

At this point she got up and left.  She looked so damn pissed off, this little 5 foot girl who weighed maybe 90 pounds.  I was surprised she didn‚Äôt punch a hole in the wall or something.  Well after she left, the ladies just cleared their throat awkwardly and looked at one another, not sure of what to do.  Taking this as a sign of the end of the presentation, most just got up and left.  I stayed behind and told the principal (no school staff was present).  The guy never got in trouble, but the girl ended up missing a few days of school (she always had perfect attendance).

When she came back, there was a lot of backlash.  She‚Äôd get a lot of sexual remarks from most guys in our school, stuff like ‚ÄúWanna come over tonight and fix that fetish of yours?‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm into roleplay babe‚Äù and it was funny to most people.  Even most girls laughed.  

Me, well I‚Äôd known this girl for awhile (even before preschool), I mean we weren‚Äôt friends but I knew her family and where she lived.  Once she came back to school and this started, I decided to walk to her house one weekend.  I got a lot of shit from her (hell I don‚Äôt blame her) and it took awhile for her to trust me.  Now, I walk her to most of her classes, and walk her to and from school (not a big deal, we both live near the school).  

I find it fucked up to see all the hell she‚Äôs gotten, just cause she asked them to talk about men being raped.  I find it sick that the guy just found men being raped as enjoyable because hell it‚Äôs sex.  Maybe this doesn‚Äôt mean anything because we‚Äôre so small and the farthest we have been is to that new hunting spot about an hour away on our snow mobiles.  But understanding this stuff isn‚Äôt just for the big cities and the universal people, I think it needs to be addressed to us small people too, cause us small people need to change too.

Women's rights and domestic violence are taboo issues in this country, and the statistics are frightening. We want to not only use this campaign to support this domestic violence shelter, but also to raise awareness, get rid of the taboo, and empower women.

We try to use social media to raise awareness and crowdfund this project, but I am posting on /r/women to ask you for your advice. *How can I reach out to more women around the world to gain support for this campaign?*

In part this is because women are consistently [underrepresented ](https://www.nber.org/papers/w5299)in the halls of power, or in the broader [field ](https://www.nber.org/papers/w5299)of economics. In countries with patriarchal norms such as India, few own the largest [businesses](https://www.forbes.com/india-billionaires/list/), or are even engaged in the [labor ](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS)market at all. In today‚Äôs podcast episode, I will be discussing the myriad ways in which women‚Äôs rights are central to economic development. In part one, I will discuss how issues of women‚Äôs rights are closely tied to other social issues by exploring the history of women‚Äôs rights in Kerala. In part two, I will be discussing the economic roots of the disturbing rise in gender selective abortions. Finally, in part three, I will discuss the positive relationship between improving the rights of women, and both the quality of governance and GDP per capita across India.

The caste system in pre-modern Kerala was an absolute [madhouse](https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/from-madhouse-to-miracle/264117). A servant would force all untouchables off public roads when a Brahmin left the house because it was polluting for the shadow of a Brahmin to touch one of an untouchable. One of the restrictions that rankled most was a ban on low caste women from [covering ](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/sabarimala-row-travancore-parallel-the-fight-to-wear-an-upper-garment-5406642/)their breasts. From 1813 onwards, low caste women in Kerala began organizing protests and refused to follow old clothing laws. Despite facing beatings and violence from upper caste men, the king of Travancore was forced in 1859 to formally allow women to wear whatever they wanted to. The Channar Revolt was the beginning of a movement to tear down the old social order and the recent conflict surrounding the Sabarimala temple must be understood in the [context ](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2019/01/sabarimala-temple-india-kerala-protests/)of this history. More broadly, this movement, known as the Kerala Renaissance, led to mass agitation for greater rights, the formation of new [institutions of education](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4408460). Women in Kerala were far more likely to receive formal education, and find paid work outside the house. By the 1930s, women from Kerala made up a vastly [disproportionate ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4408460?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)share of nurses and teachers in India. After independence, this environment of social effervescence continued, and the competition between Congress and the Communist Party, combined with agitation from both men and women from below have been central to the creation of India‚Äôs most comprehensive welfare state, with rates in [infant mortality](https://niti.gov.in/content/infant-mortality-rate-imr-1000-live-births) and [life expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_states_by_life_expectancy_at_birth) not to distant from those of the United States.

One of the most damaging ways patriarchy is impacting India is the rise of gender selective abortion. Although female infanticide was common among certain aristocratic communities in northern and western India, massive gender imbalances are a modern [phenomenon](http://censusindia.gov.in/Data_Products/Library/Provisional_Population_Total_link/PDF_Links/chapter6.pdf). In 1981 there were 962 girls for every 1000 boys.. By 2011, this number had dropped to 927 to 1000, suggesting 8% of all female fetuses are aborted. Female abortion is so common in part because it is expected that men will carry on the family business and support parents into their old age. Only a quarter of women are in the labor force (a number that is much lower than it was a decade ago), and are instead expected to marry and take care of the house. Changing norms around marriage are making female infanticide more common. In [1930 ](https://www.isid.ac.in/~epu/acegd2017/papers/JeffreyWeaver.pdf)only one third of all marriages in India involved a dowry but by 1980 90% of all marriages involved a dowry. Moreover, the nature of dowry payments steadily changed. Dowries were initially bequests to the bride, and solely the woman‚Äôs property. However, dowries are increasingly demanded in cash and property of the groom‚Äôs family rather than the bride. By some estimates dowries are as large as [one fifth](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-despicable-persistence-of-the-dowry-in-india) a households total wealth. Combined with extravagant weddings whose cost fall primarily on the bride it is easy to see why so many families turn to gender selective abortions. The worsening gender imbalance is already having negative consequences for India. It‚Äôs not clear what millions of men who cannot find wives will do. A districts gender ratio is one of the strongest predictors of its [homicide rate](https://www.jstor.org/stable/172520?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), and there are fears of severe social conflict due to this.

More important than the violence of men is the potential scientists, artists and leaders that are never born because of gender selective abortions. It is women‚Äôs potential as leaders that I want to discuss in the final part of my podcast. Although India has had many powerful politicians such as former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, only [11%](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/61-women-make-it-to-lok-sabha-in-2014-against-59-in-2009--44447) of all members of India‚Äôs parliament are women. In order to rectify this situation, the Indian government reserved one third of all village council leader positions to women. In addition to massively expanding women‚Äôs power at the local level, it created a natural experiment to test the effectiveness of women legislators. Women led village councils consistently [prioritized ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2004.00539.x)women‚Äôs issues, led to more women attending village assemblies and speaking more often. Villages with women leaders consistently had superior heath and education [outcomes](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/docs/macours-karen/pathak_macours_may0816.pdf), and better police response against [crimes against women.¬†](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/11-092_05eaf393-0012-4d12-9d73-0c07d3f7af46.pdf)At higher levels of o[ffice,](https://www.theigc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Baskaran-et-al-2018-Working-paper.pdf) women were one third as likely to have criminal charges lodged against them, substantially less likely to accumulate wealth in office, and more likely to ensure infrastructure projects were completed in their home districts. More broadly, those regions of South Asia with higher levels of sexism and patriarchy have consistently performed worse not only on human development issues such as infant mortality and literacy rate, but also on exports, GDP growth etc. Women clearly can act as powerful agents of development if given the opportunity.

  I am a fellow Redditor (I promise I am one of you, this is a throwaway account since so much of my personal information is connected to the survey process). I want to conduct this research with Redditor‚Äôs to create a better, diverse understanding of how young adults understand and give sexual consent. I have selected subreddits I think have interest in my research and research topic. If you can think of a fellow Redditor or another subReddit that would enjoy being part of this research please feel free to share the link.

  For any interested Redditors that are 18-24 years old and currently living in the US: Please help me create a more thorough understanding of how sexual consent is given and received in sexual interactions. I am completing my Master‚Äôs thesis by conducting an open-ended survey about the consent process in sexual interactions. Your time and willingness to share your experiences are greatly appreciated and will help contribute to a better understanding of how we give or receive sexual consent.

  Upon request, I can provide you with my IRB approval from MTSU. Responses will be used in my thesis, and direct quotes may be used in the results of the research. No identifiable information is being collected, and responses will be anonymous. Your confidentiality and anonymity is of great importance for me as a researcher. I encourage participants to be as open, honest and complete with their responses as they feel comfortable with.

  The survey starts with an informed consent page that details and explains all the necessary information about the research for you as the participant. There are a few demographic questions following the survey.

  There is no compensation for participating in the research other than my sincere gratitude and an opportunity to collaborate in exploring sexual consent as a social phenomenon. The anticipated risks for participants are minimal, and all efforts are being undertaken to minimize risk and discomfort for participants.

  I expect the survey to take approximately 30 to 60 minutes to complete. I have turned off the collection of IP and email addresses, so responses are completely anonymous and confidential. I also am allowing participants to go back and change responses if after completing the survey you want to add to or change a recollection or experience.

  Thank you in advance for collaborating with me on this research.

  Trigger warning The questions are not intended to be triggering, but do ask personal questions of a sensitive nature about previous sexual experiences so there is list of resources for sexual assault survivors following the survey.",1463270495.0

2) Every 20 seconds in the US a woman is assaulted or beaten.
3) Boyfriends assaulting girlfriends who are not living together can still be considered domestic violence.
4) Approximately 10 million children view some sort of domestic violence each year.
5) Men who experienced domestic violence between their parents as children are more likely to abuse their own wives in the future.  
6) Even if a child is not home at the time of the domestic abuse, some child protection agencies will view the home as abusive for the child.
7) Female college students are the most likely to experience nonfatal intimate partner violence.  
8)  In intimate partner homicides, including the deaths of males and females, 65% of women were physically assaulted before the murder.  
9) 8,400 homicides are due to intimate partner violence each year.  
10) Stalking is a part of intimate partner violence.  








Answers:  
1)  True, although 85% of  reported domestic violence involves women victims.  
2)  False, every 9 seconds a woman in the US is assaulted or beaten. 
3)  True, and this is pat of the reason why many use the term ‚ÄòIntimate Partner Violence‚Äù instead of Domestic Violence because it is a more inclusive term.  
4)  True, with 1.3 million women being victims of physical assault each year.  
5)  True, males who lived with domestic abuse in the home are actually twice as likely to become abusers themselves.
6)  True, and this can sometimes result in the removal of the child from the home.
7) Partly true, because women ages 20-24 are at the highest risk for nonfatal partner violence.  
8)  False, 70-80% of women involved in intimate partner homicides, no matter what the sex of the murder victim was, were physically abused before hand by the man.

2,2,How bout compassion?,10,cki5h7,men,https://www.reddit.com/r/men/comments/cki5h7/how_bout_compassion/,5,"Incel is a slang term used to describe someone who is an ‚Äúinvoluntary celibate‚Äù, ie a person who desires sex but isn‚Äôt having it. 

They‚Äôre teased for being virgins (‚Äúvirgin-shaming‚Äù).  This is a new societal shift that has radically changed within the past two decades.  It wasn‚Äôt long ago when you may have been shamed for being sexual outside of marriage, now you‚Äôre shamed if you haven‚Äôt had sex before marriage.  

Think about the 2005 movie The 40-Year-Old Virgin where the main character is encouraged by his friends to lose his virginity as an objective unto its own.  In short, the worldview is if you haven‚Äôt had sex by 30, you must be not only sexually inadequate, defective, and inept.

They‚Äôre also sometimes teased or bullied for being socially awkward or being different.  This often can be due to physical disabilities, physical characteristics (weight, height, facial features, acne, etc.), and a lack of understanding social cues (not knowing when to start or stop talking, not knowing how much to share and possibly over-sharing in certain situations to name a few). 

Combine this with their social isolation along with hobbies and interests that lend themselves to public mockery,like online games,comics etc.

The level of humiliation and shame is difficult  on each individual level, let alone the collective toll it can have on a person‚Äôs psyche who may already be grappling with prior levels of shame before being exposed to the soul-crushing sexual shame that afflicts these individuals.  The sexual inadequacy among men may be the most humiliating and painful in terms of shame.

It's not fun, because if you can't get laid you are not a Man ‚Ñ¢ . That affects your sense of self worth, females can pick up that and that leads to them becoming dry as Sahara.

 As age progresses it get worse because you have performance anxiety and no experience. 
Sadly, women cannot perhaps fully understand the physiological impact of how it actually is to be a male in this situation.

It leads to self hate, depression and sometimes sadly anger and violence. If you for example have autistic traits, it makes it awfully hard to get a girlfriend. There are PUA seminars that sadly preys on sad lonely men,-and some of these actually cannot change who they are or improve. No persistence,no PUA seminars or tactics can help anyone who just can't help that they are on the autistic spectrum,have a bad stutter or is short. 

And there are women that can reject some men in a very crude way,or use them for free food,drinks etc without any regrets or feeling at all to a better candidate comes along.

There are also the risk of being labelled as a creep and being plastered on social media as such. The rampant fluidic definition of what constitutes a #meetoo or rape and that women ( this is discussed heavily ) in most cases are the gatekeepers of sex and  has it less stressful and risky on the market leads to men giving up and opting out.

What do we do with them? What can we do for them? How about compassion, empathy and understanding ?

I've been in a relationship for 4 years.

I put in a lot of effort to keep my girlfriend sexually fulfilled. However, I cannot express my own desires without her feeling pressured and get angry with me, no matter how delicate I try to be. I feel like I can't keep letting this sit unresolved within me. I ask for advice.

I feel awkward and self-absorbed for writing this next part. Sorry. But I really want to share that I've been dedicated to keeping our sex life great and I also want to celebrate the good stuff.

I've been working out to the level of having a six pack. I have read up on and practiced cunnilingus to be able to confidently make it pleasurable for her. I know she gets turned on by feeling desired and me handling her like I can't get enough. I used to be so sensitive that I couldn't move much once I entered her, but my workouts have made it so that lasting long and intensity isn't a problem anymore. She usually orgasms over and over when we have sex.

Her previous relationship was bad. She was eager to do whatever that guy wanted in order to get his approval. Of course, he was a scumbag with a fair share of surpresed perverted ideas that ended up being damaging to her. During our 4 years, I have made a point never to pressure her in to sex and encouraged her to say no without having to say another word to justify it afterwards. It's been healing for both of us.

I have encouraged her to share her fantasies. She is firm on that she does not like any type of fetishes and she hates talking about what kind of sex one would like to experience, because she feels that it makes the act artificial, pre-planned and that she gets claustrophobic from feeling that she has to act. To her sex has to be organic and in the moment.

She has however shared that she'd like to be rimmed and that she has fantasies about having sex with other people. The rimming was fun. And while she was out of the country for a few months, I felt ready to open up temporarily. We both had different lovers for that period of time. That wish did come from her side, but I genuinely felt that I was ready for it too. She is young and beautiful and the thought that I am the only guy she is ever going to experience sex with ever again through out her whole life just seems like violence to me. And to my great surprise I actually found another girl almost instantly. This used to be my largest fear in life and I had to work with accepting strong feelings of jealousy. But now that it's over I am surprised with how little drama there were and I am rather proud of myself.

Now to my sexual desires. I long to feel desired myself. I am the one initiating, the foreplay is about getting her horny, I am the active one during sex. I feel like there is only room for her pleasure. She doesn't do much to try to turn me on. For example, her wearing clothes that she herself deem sexy and comfortable would be a huge turn on for me. Just being allowed to relax and receieve a blowjob now and then would have made me feel totally at ease with our relationship. And it is not like I need a -specific- thing to happen. I just want to feel like she puts effort in to our sex life too. I want to feel like she prioritizes me and my pleasure, in whatever way works for her.

The times I've tried to bring this up she gets upset. I feel she takes it way to far by saying things like I can't accept her as she is. I love her and her body. And I get that she is fine with the way things are because she receieves a lot of sexual attention already. I feel like she does not understand my perspective and I struggle to communicate it to her. And at the same time I have to respect her troublesome past.

I honestly have started thinking that if this will never change, I am not interested in staying with her. Sex is a big deal to me, as I'm sure you can tell. But I feel like it's wrong to threaten her with breaking up.

How should I talk to her about this? Also, I invite you to let me know if I come off as hypocritical or dellusional. I would take that in to concideration.  Thank you for reading. <3",1589584163.0

What sucks is that I know there are women out there who love to be eaten out and sometimes I feel like I am with the wrong woman because of this. It doesn‚Äôt seem fair, I have talked and talked to her about this, I have made compromises on things for her that she wants that I don‚Äôt. I read a post here recently about women letting their man go down because that‚Äôs what their man wanted and they did it for their man, that seems fair to me, I mean even if she doesn‚Äôt cum from me eating her out I jist wanna do it, for hours and hours, I love a woman‚Äôs vagina and I have never seen an ugly one, I crave it, I crave the smell, the skin folds, the labia inner and outer, I have tried and tried talking to her about this and still same thing every time I ask.

I am almost to the point of leaving her over this, I wish I had a woman who would let me fulfill my passion, it doesn‚Äôt go away, I always think about it, when we start the sex process I still to this day try and go down but she always pushes my head back before I can get to it, it‚Äôs so depressing and frustrating ladies.

All of my SOs have been willing to have sex, but majority of the time it's been ""oh, you want sex? Ok"" and they lie down, which honestly makes me feel like shit. I work out, get told I look fine, and obviously that they care for me (these arent hook ups, not that that's a bad thing), but... no desire?

Looking online, theres tons of stuff talking about women and feeling desired, but not much for men it seems (and the few I found tend to, well, demonize men who want to feel wanted), so I figured I'd just ask:

Should I, as a man, want my partner to want me sexually, or just be fine that they will have sex with me in general?

ETA: some common answers to things I'm getting frequently-

Currently in a relationship (1.5). We did a few months of weekly therapy last year, but not sure if we would go again as she wasnt the most receptive to going the first time.

More info to clarify: if we have sex, I have to initiate it. No, i dont just take her to bedroom, I do try and build up, even through day (sexy texts and such), and when together build up with kissing, touching, etc, before bedroom.

In bedroom, I go down on her, use toys, whatever I can to ensure (or I guess think I am doing?) She gets off and enjoys it. I honestly like this, my SO enjoying sex and orgasming is my biggest turn on and sex just kinda feels wrong if it doesnt happen (one thing I've had to working in myself, putting too much pressure on her orgasm, since sometimes it just doesnt happen).

I do ask and make sure that what I'm doing she actually likes, or if I'm not doing something she would like me to do.

That's kind of why I'm so perplexed, I keep getting told I'm fine, but when I express I would like her to initiate and show she wants me how I show I want her (she has told me she needs to feel wanted after relationships of being the only one starting things and wants to be the one chased in this relationship). I love her, we have our issues but she isnt a bad person, I just dont know what to do üòÇ",1585055007.0

I stayed at his place for few month now, it was nice, I really like spending time with him, but the sexual part is quite rare. We had a discussion a few days ago and he told me that his main sexual desire was for a certain type of specific problem (I knew it) that involved some sort of takeover of a partner, and it worked better with people he didn't really have sex with before, sort of a conquest idea and stuff like that.   


Anyway, with a partner that he already knows we can have sex, he doesn't really feel excited. But at the moment there is not really any possibility of meeting new people, and for my part it is the only partner that I have now ...  I'm not mad at him for not having desire, I'm probably a little sad but I don't know what to think.

I was raised in a very conservative Christian group that I would label a cult now (house church, shunned people who weren‚Äôt in the group, all lived in the same couple neighborhoods and homeschooled together, gave leader total authority, etc.) As a female, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to wear makeup, had to wear a tank top under every shirt (even loose tshirts) to hide boobs, wear pants at least a size too big to hide butt... in order to avoid attention from men because if they lusted after me then I was unclean before God. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to talk to boys. My homeschooling once i was a teenager was with girls only. No dating, obviously. Sex was barely explained to me and any romantic feelings were sinful, as was masturbation. (Which I was made to feel like a total pervert for doing. I had no idea it was something normal that almost everyone does lol.) 

When I was 21, I left the cult, as did my parents and siblings. I was still a Christian and it has only been in the last year or two that I have stopped being a Christian (I‚Äôm 28 now). I got married to an amazing guy when I was 25. We dated for almost 3 years first and although I was a virgin when we married, I definitely enjoyed making out and some petting beforehand. Really enjoyed it. I would have had sex if it were not for my Christian beliefs. 

Cut to being married: I have almost no sex drive and at times feel disgusted by it. I am in therapy with a great psychotherapist but I cannot seem to make progress on this. I‚Äôve had my hormones checked and they are normal. I am not on birth control and got off (with dr help) my antidepressants. Still nothing. It is so discouraging. I remember how much I enjoyed messing around before so I know I am capable of it and I just can‚Äôt help but think this has to do with my upbringing.

Maybe this is the wrong sub for this, but I thought others might have some insight or similar experiences. Or encouragement. I love my husband and really miss enjoying sexual intimacy.

Some background:

  

1. We‚Äôre from a relatively conservative Asia country, but nowadays enjoying sex is totally normal among young generation in our country

2. However my wife was raised up in a really old fashioned / conservative (not the U.S. political conservative, but ‚Äúanything related to sex is shame‚Äù conservative). We started our relationship from university (first love to each other) and getting married after graduating from our master degree in UK

3. My wife is really conservative in sex even before we getting married, and I know that from beginning ‚Äì she‚Äôs not willing to have sex out of the wedlock and I agreed to save it after getting married

4. After getting married, she never ever voluntarily show her desire to have sex with me. It‚Äôs all my request, and it felt like she‚Äôs not enjoying it and it‚Äôs become kind of obligation to her as a wife:

* a) For the first 5-10 times, it‚Äôs very hard to get penetration and she‚Äôs so scared to let me P in her V as she said it‚Äôs too painful (I offered to do some foreplay such as touch / kiss her breasts, neck, ear, thighs, V and etc., however she said it‚Äôs kind of uncomfortable and she didn‚Äôt let me do it any more after 1-2 tries)
* b) After the initial pain period, she rarely feels the pain during penetration, however she still doesn‚Äôt seem to enjoy it ‚Äì I‚Äôm the only one who would ever to request for sex and she sometimes tries to find excuses such as it‚Äôs too tired, it‚Äôs too late, she‚Äôs not in the mood, she‚Äôd like to finish the book / TV, etc.
* c) Someone before gave me the suggestion that she doesn‚Äôt enjoy it it‚Äôs because I never pleased her (orgasm). It is true that I never see her in orgasm, but I don‚Äôt know what I can do: she doesn‚Äôt allow any kind of touching of her body (only kiss and hug for foreplay), she can‚Äôt stand for penetration longer than probably 10-15 mins (otherwise she would ask me to get out and help me to jerk it off or suck it out), she doesn‚Äôt want to try any position other than the convention one, no vibrators, no dirty talks. It‚Äôs just plain penetration without any interaction from her side
* d) With all the restrictions, she nevertheless understand my needs and okay with 1-2 sex a week (again, just plain penetration, and she never brought it up, it‚Äôs all down to me)

5. I tried to have tens if not hundreds talk with her on the issue of our sex life, and tell her how I love her and it‚Äôs not for me to enjoy the sex but for both of us, she always said that she‚Äôs trying and will try to adapt, however 8 years after marry we‚Äôre basically still at the same situation (recently she started to allow me to grab her breasts, but not for too long). And I got the feeling that she‚Äôs always trying to avoid talking about this issue, probably deeply she felt ashamed about sex

6. I also tried to convince her to see a therapist, but she always responded that she‚Äôs working on it, and don‚Äôt see this as an such significant issue (in the end we still got to have sex 1-2 times a week), and don‚Äôt want to talk this in front of other people

7. Some other background: We‚Äôre in very good relationship except the sex life, we both love each other very much, and have two brilliant kids.

15,15,[35F] Feeling like what I want in a romantic and sexual relationship is both unattainable and possibly unhealthy. Do I need to examine my desires?,1,gpsb0c,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/gpsb0c/35f_feeling_like_what_i_want_in_a_romantic_and/,3,"Hi, everyone. Throw away account for, what I think, are obvious reasons. :) 

As the title says, I‚Äôm a 35 year old female and I‚Äôve been feeling for a while that what I want out of an emotional, sexual, and mental relationship is completely unattainable and I should just give up. Which makes me sad. And then I wonder if it‚Äôs because what I want is super fucked up and only practiced by unwell people. 

On to what I want, as to not be so vague...

I really want the type of relationship that is the 24/7 D/s dynamic, but one with a lot of control and possession ‚Äî that genuinely comes from a loving place though. I think most people see this dynamic as abusive or lame (I see references to Christian Gray a lot, which bums me out... PS, I found the books unreadable and the movies fun but overall laughable). 

I fantasize a lot about this strong, controlled, confident man, who will want to see me at my best and ensure I get there. Who will have needs of his own and ensure he gets those fulfilled, too. Who will see me as ‚Äúhis‚Äù, ownership is hot to me. Who will be into aspects of BDSM but still be a loyal, one-woman type who treasures me and our relationship and looks at it as sanctuary. 

Even just writing it out makes me feel hopeless. I‚Äôve had relationships, one of which was even slightly down this avenue... but he ended up being actually abusive, physically and mentally. And also wanted threesomes, which is cool for those who like it, but it‚Äôs not my thing at all. Part of what makes sex and relationships appealing to me is the possession, and some jealousy. 

I suppose I‚Äôm just rambling on. Can anyone advise if this is even possible or if it‚Äôs just a fantasy person I‚Äôll never actually find so I can just keep reading erotic and settle down with someone who is at least nice? I‚Äôm 35 and feeling like an old maid. :(

From 18-22 I was very open to sex, if it was clean, safe and fun I would try anything once, more than once if I enjoyed it.  From 23-46 was in 2 different LTR's that went from great vanilla to boring to lost interest in sex with them as a result.  Yes I tried talking, tried leaving hints, anything and everything to spice things up but was always met with ""ewww"" ""no way"" ""not me"" or some variation of that, or the silent treatment.  I enjoy sexual fun, variety and spice and with JUST my partner, did the threesomes, couples, party scene early on and never cared for that with a dedicated partner.  Never once cheated on either of my partners in 23 years because consent, boundaries and honesty are a huge deal for me.

The big issue I always had was ever single sexual encounter with each LTR had to conclude with intercourse to completion, EVERY TIME.  Oral led to intercourse, toy play led to intercourse, kissing led to intercourse, hell even cuddling/snuggling had to lead to intercourse.  Anything less and it was not ""fullfilling"" to them.  I told my last LTR many times I would love to walk in the door, see you naked sitting in the chair and have you demand I get down and eat you out to orgasm and go about the rest of our day.  I enjoy light D/s/Switch roll play, among other things, and on those days would love to just service with no expectations after.  Well... 12 years not once did that ever happen besides ending in a dead bedroom.

Anyway, its been 6 years since last LTR ended and after that relationship I felt so sexually dejected I have not entered another.  I am now above 50, and seriously feel unable to restart that part of my life.  I think the years of being sexually repressed and pair bonded messed up my ability to see sex as a fun adventure and more as something to avoid, be ashamed of or what I don't know.  I have had a few short dating partners in the last 6 years, but when the discussion of sex came up they made it clear vanilla was their only option and anything more was out.

At first we did it every week like 1 or 2 times, we lived in our respectives parents home because of money issues.

After some time, the times we had sex reduced to maybe 1 time a month and if i lucks helped.

Nowadays she doesnt even want to talk about sex. I try to be communicative and told her that i need some more, that I would respect her if she doesnt want to do it some day, but at least i want to be able to talk about sex with her...she accepted it at first. 

The next day we did it after that conversation, i thought that she only did it because of what i told her....and i think i wasnt wrong... everytime after that she just when i try to even get my hand near even by accident, she says that it makes her tickles, and she said that almost always, always saying that it makes her tickles, that she is tired, headache, sleepy,...

Its very difficult...

We cant go out, so we are separate.... so even more difficult. Every time i bring up the theme to talk about it a bit she only says the same sentence and go to other theme.

Over 1 month of being unable of going out later, we managed to get to at least sexting, she told me to send a pic, so i did, and when i asked her she didnt even wanted at first but accepted and sent a pic that was...really pitiful, only a bit of her panties showing, not even a glance of nothing, i didnt want to push it anymore and said that it was really good (it wasnt).
At the beggining of our relationship she send things more spicy.

The thing is lately this months even before being unable to go out, i tried to bring up the theme but almost never succeded because she changes topics.

One time, she told me that i make her anxious, that she knows that maybe im in need of sex but it isnt her problem. 

That discouraged me a lot and made me think about all the relationship. I never ever forced her, i never would do anything to make her feel hurt, i would never even think about cheat on her, because i love her, i love her so much that i dont know what to do.
I love her and she says that she loves me a lot, but i dont feel sexually desired, maybe im not attractive enough, maybe its all my problem as she said it was and made me think that maybe im hipersexual or something. She said that it has to happen naturally...

She would only go to me for sex when she rly needs it and we only do it when she wants.

I feel like a tool, im happy about the relationship in general but the sex part is killing me.

I thought about refusing her when she get in the mood, but i know i cant do that to her.

What should i do? Im really lost and confused.

I want to be with her forever, but i dont know how to solve this problem

If she decides to keep the baby my options are sacrifice everything I want, or become a dead beat asshole that everyone scoffs at. So getting a girl pregnant is probably my biggest fear.

I also have a ton of really weird fetishes which I won't go into the details of, but basically every time I cum I feel pathetic and humiliated because of the nature of some of these fetishes. My issues with pornography has also screwed my sleep patttern royally on numerous ocassions, shattered all productivity, its nothing but a distraction that gets in the way of what I really want. Basically, the only thing I like about sex is the pleasure you get in the moment. Everything else is wrapped up in drama, self loathing and the possibility of blowing up my plans for the future.

We picked out some lingerie for her and some tight yoga pants for me. Later that night she wore her outfit and I struggled controlling my urges to rip it off of her. I made it quite clear through my words and actions just how much she turned me on. I opted for a suit and tie that night to be more romantic. In hind sight I wish I would have stripped down and gotten into my yoga pants but one thing led to another pretty quickly and I didn't get an opportunity to change clothes. So I saved the yoga pants for this past weekend.

Fast forward to this past weekend, right before cuddling up to a movie I went to the bathroom to change into my outfit. They leave very little to the imagination, she could easily see the outline of everything and I made sure I was good and hard for her when I walked out. I may as well have worn nothing. My hope was she would put off watching the movie to take in the view and maybe get a bit frisky but she barely batted an eye. No comment, no complement, no touching. She was just laying in bed with remote in hand. We watched the entire movie without even a leg rub from her. I initiated sex after the movie but deep down I just wanted to roll over and go to sleep.

Normally we have very good communication. I have told her multiple times how her lack of initiating and expressing her desire for me really hurts. But this experience hurt more than everything else I have felt. I wore this outfit for her. I wanted to be sexy for her. But instead I felt gross for even thinking of wearing it. Gaining the courage to wear such an outfit took a lot for me. Now I almost want to throw the yoga pants away.

I want to talk to her about this but I am getting to the point where I feel like it's useless now. She is not selfish, she is very loving and supportive and we care deeply for each other. When we have sex she is very enthusiastic. But outside of sex, I just don't think what I have said has sunk in. I feel like she doesn't even realize how little she expresses her sexual desire for me. She hasn't initiated sex once in the 9 months we have dated. And it hurts so much. I don't know what to do.",1582636964.0

We've always made it work, but lately, it's starting to bother me to a point where it bleeds out of the bedroom into other parts of our relationship.

I feel like she has zero sexual interest and no agenda of her own, and I'm starting to resent her for it. I mean, we do have sex, but everything we do is dependent on me in one way or another.  

For example, it's not like she doesn't initiate sex. She does. But almost every time she initiates, it's evidently not because of lust or desire, but clearly because she thinks we're ""supposed"" to have sex again. She treats it like a chore, even though she gives her best to not show it.  
At the end of the day, we don't fuck because she wants to get fucked - we fuck because it's a nice little favor she does to keep me happy. While I appreciate the gesture... it's not enough. I want to be *desired*. I want her to want me, I want her to fucking ravage me. And I want her to want to be desired and ravaged, too! I want her to want to get fucked, I want her to want to have her own desires satisfied. But there don't seem to be any desires.


It's not like our sex life is boring per se. We actually do some pretty kinky stuff every once in a while. My issue is that anything we do, any little thing, from the kinkiest stuff down to the simplest things like position changes... we do because of me.  
It's not like she's completely passive in bed or doesn't get any pleasure - but it all comes down to me in one way or another. If we use a certain toy or do a certain sex act, she does get into it, but we only do it because *I* introduced it someday and because *I* proposed that we do it tonight.  

She appears to have absolutely zero sexual agenda of her own. No specific desires to be met, no curiosities to be satisfied, no exploration, no experimentation, no new stuff she heard about or found online and wants to try.  
Hell, it's gotten so bad that I'm actually starting to fantasize about her desiring or even fucking other men, because at least that would show me that she is a sexual being capable of feeling sexual desire of her own.


I don't know what to do anymore. I mean sure, obviously I need to address this issue, but I have no idea how to do this without coming across as extremely accusatory.

Were both late 20's married two years, together 3 years before that. 

I'm not really sure how to write this but here we go...Kissing is a thing i would love to do with my wife, but she won't kiss me. she has never tried to kiss me. I always am the one to try and kiss her and when i do it's like she hates it. I don't know why and i can't get her to tell to me why, I've asked probably 100+ times over the years. I've asked if it's because my breath smells, my beard, if she has germ issues, and i'll i get from her is ""I don't know, it's just..."" and that's it. She stops talking or changes the topic. 

More than anything i wish she would suck my dick. but she's done it once for like 15 seconds four years ago. I ask pretty often, but it's always the same answer, ""no"". I thought maybe it's the asking she gets tired of so i stopped that for a while, and still nothing. I've asked why she won't and it's the same answer for kissing, ""I don't know, it's just..."" 

Anal is something i would love to experience once in my life. I don't know why. It just is. But she won't let me do that either. She says she's tried it once before and it hurt so she won't try it again. Which makes me super jealous and annoyed. i could probably get over this if she did any of the other stuff on my list. 

Doggy style is by far my favorite position, but when i ask, she just want's me to get on top. 

To be fair to my wife, i'm terrible in bed, it's a disaster. I have a small penis and she doesn't give me enough sex to practice to get good at anything. Also to be fair to my wife, She's had several miscarriages and is emotionally tied that directly to sex even though I've offered to use a condom. 

If you think communication is the problem, Your correct! but when i try to start a conversation about sex it leads nowhere. She quickly gets frustrated by the questions i have and changes the topic or i give up. I've asked her to see a marriage counselor or a sex therapist and she hates the idea. She hates the idea of sharing this super personal stuff with anyone. She would get very mad if she ever found this post. 

I'm frustrated to the point where i'm constantly depressed and angry. If it weren't for having a kid with her i'd be gone. the last couple weeks I've started jokingly asked her when she's moving out. She doesn't like that. She says she'll move out but with our daughter and that's unacceptable to me.

34,34,How can I [30m] overcome negative feelings about my sexuality and accept my sexual desires?,0,g2lvk9,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/g2lvk9/how_can_i_30m_overcome_negative_feelings_about_my/,5," **The problem**

I  have a lot of negative feelings about my sexual desires after years of  constant rejection by my anti-sexual ex-girlfriend (which was perfectly  right of her to do, but which hurt me anyway). Mainly, I have a hard  time actually believing that my sexuality isn't a disgusting, despicable  drive that I need to suppress and hide to be an acceptable, likable  human being. (Rationally, I know that this is the case, but this doesn't  help.)

I want to get back a healthy view on my sexuality so that I can finally try and embrace it and possibly be happier for it.

Naturally,  I will try to meet people and gain some much-needed experience, but there are a lot of conflicting emotions at play  here and I'm not sure how well this will work.

I  tried talking to my friends about this topic. Sadly (for me, not for  them), they didn't or rather couldn't understand, because to them  sexuality is a perfectly normal part of life. I'm too inhibited to talk  about it any further with them, which is why I'm now asking random  strangers on the internet ;)

So how might I begin tackling these feelings? Any suggestions and relatable experiences would be greatly appreciated!

**Some background**

I  met said girlfriend when both of us were 20. Neither of us had any  prior romantic relationship experience. Additionally, she was very  reserved about any kind of emotional or physical connection. With a lot  of patience and communication we slowly worked through her difficulties.  Over the course of a year she went from merely tolerating being touched  (in non-intimate ways) to actually enjoying it and finally  reciprocating. In the same way, she opened up, dropped her reservations  and we grew close.

Within the  following two years, she ""officially"" became my girlfriend, we hugged  and cuddled a lot and she loved it and really enjoyed the time we spent  together (and so did I). I was happy that our relationship included this  kind of physical and romantical affection and managed to ignore any  sexual feelings I had. When I (rarely) brought up the topic of sex or  more intimate physical contact, she usually said ""I'm not sure, maybe  some time later"". At that point, I was perfectly happy with her answer  because sexuality was not very important to me. I was curious, but I  felt that I could live without it. Basically, I felt that it was a small  price to be paid for being with her.

Slowly,  however, my feelings changed and became harder to ignore and I  developed a desire to be more intimate with her. I wanted more than just  hugging and cuddling. These are wonderful, but they didn't satisfy the  desire I had. I wanted to explore these new feelings, together with her.

We  discussed this, regularly, over the course of three years. I understood  that this would be another difficult topic for her, but I hoped that  she might understand that this was important to me. I suggested that we  should take really small steps (like ""You touch me here for a short time  and we see how it goes, and then I touch you there for a short time and  we see how that goes, and if it's okay we maybe can touch slightly  longer""), so that we both could become comfortable and get used to the  new sensations and emotions we might feel. But she didn't like even the  idea of it. To her, all of these feelings and ideas were completely  alien and incomprehensible and also pretty disgusting and unimaginable.  Anything that was even remotely related to any kind of sexual activity  was simply impossible for her. She stressed that she would really like  to make me happy, but that it was just not possible for her.

I  would like to point out that I don't see this as her ""fault"", that's  just how she was and she had every right not to be more intimate with  me. But since it wasn't her fault, I decided that it was my fault for  even wanting this. The longer our discussion went, the harder it became  for me because my desires didn't bother to go away. I tried to explain  how much this hurt me, but she couldn't understand. Conversely, I  wouldn't have wanted her to do anything she didn't want herself - that  would have been even worse than the rejection.

Over  time I grew ashamed of my desires, wished for them to go away, started  to hate them. At one point she said ""Had I known that you would want  this, I would never have allowed us to become so close"". It's not what  she wanted to say, but it left me feeling like I was some kind of  seriously damaged person ‚Äì the guy that only wants disgusting, perverted  sex.

I loved this girl, I really  did, and we were a great match in any way but this. The permanent  rejection and the negative feelings it provoked, however, became  unbearable. I finally broke up with her when I couldn't take it any  longer. It made me feel bad, because I felt like I broke up with the  woman of my dreams ""just because of sex"", but it was the only way. I  know now that I should have done this about two years earlier, when it  first became painfully obvious that it could not possibly work out, but  that's the typical thing about hindsight.

This  was about three years ago. My desires calmed down once she was gone and  I basically avoided any thoughts and ideas about my sexuality and any  kind of romantic relationships. I took up my first job after graduating  and moved to a new city. My life changed a lot, which took me quite some  time and energy to get used to (even though basically all the changes  were good).

I'm now finally making  some progress towards living a more fulfilling life. I was convinced  that I would best give up completely on anything related to my sexuality  because I felt so negatively about it, but my recent progress made me  think that I might be able to overcome these feelings. At the very least  I will try because there is nothing to lose, and so any help is greatly  appreciated.",1587094446.0

39,39,How do you keep/maintain feelings and thoughts of desire for you partner? I struggle with this over time.,3,fycgpz,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/fycgpz/how_do_you_keepmaintain_feelings_and_thoughts_of/,3,"I'm a very wanted, loved woman. In my head I know this. My rational thinking tells me they want all of me, in every possible aspect. Their way of showing me this love is mainly through actions - sexual advances and doing the dishes or buying me chocolate. Then why do I turn them down, ever? I should be pleased and happy right? I'm so lucky!

I've asked myself this question, over and over and last night I came to one conclusion: they show very little to no interest in what goes on in my mind, my thoughts.

I think of myself as a ""mind with a body"". My body is the host that I at times ignore, neglect and think of with contempt - it takes so much time and effort to maintain this flesh. I don't see my body as attractive, beautiful or even interesting. Compliments on my appearance are usually ignored by me, they mean very little when I don't agree and most of them I perceive as pure lies. However, as long as my mind is challenged, entertained and stimulated (perhaps even admired), I will be kind to my body and accept - even embrace - its needs, reactions etc. Sexy times will then be on the table for as long as my mind is satisfied, days, weeks, months at a time, all depending.

In the beginning they couldn't stop talking to me. They used to ask me a million questions that would lead to really long, engaging and stimulating conversations about all kinds of topics. Somewhere along the line they stopped and I didn't notice when it happened. As life and time goes on, it seems that I'm no longer new and therefore not as interesting as I used to be. This is a huge problem to me. As their active interest in my mental activity, my ideas and thoughts decreases, my sexual interest does too.

Communication is key, so I voiced these thoughts to them the other night, as to explain why I had trouble getting in the mood. I'm not sure if it had any effect, I just tried to start an interesting conversation that maybe would fix both these issues?  In a practical sense, I'm difficult to satisfy due to a general lack of time and energy directly connected to ""real life"". For as long as I can recall, I've thought of myself as difficult to please. I start all my relationships with fantastic, enthusiastic sex. Eventually, I end all of them when I no longer desire my partners.

How can I keep feeling desire for my partners when my desire depends so much on their genuine interest for my brain? Most men I've encountered are focused on physical triggers and reactions. Most of them are also used to women that believe and react to their compliments. To this, I react with (inwards) anger, envy and frustration. 

I get very tired of myself at times and so I withdraw, leaving my partners wondering why I'm so distant, so cold.

Many women don't realise that when they aren't having sex with their man that other shit could be happening. Many women think if they fuck their guy once a day that means their desires are handled. But I know I can have sex three times a day and still want to use my vibrator. I put a larger emphasis on pleasure but I am not offended my partner is a visual person. I think men and women get insecure and jealous when trust is broken or reassurance isn't given in a relationship. It can be eye opening and hurtful for the person with a partner who seeks pleasure outside of the relationship, including online, because of lack of communication and openness, consideration, respect, and reassurance are needed to ensure the online desires and proclivities don't get in between real life connections. 

Often the partner who doesn't have the online desire needs to understand the desire, maybe they are embarrassed and feeling not wanted or whatever. They need to understand their partner still desires them, and then be given the time to work through their insecurities internally. This is also a good time to look at ways you aren't connecting. Many times people get annoyed when their needs aren't met, so some of these women would be feeling the sting of not understanding their own sexuality or perhaps their partner not understanding how to turn her tap on and keep it running. Women need variety too but haven't been allowed by society as much to explore that without feeling vulnerable or shameful. Perhaps women should be more encouraged to talk to their partner about finding online outlets for desire as well, to level the playing field but also so she can understand the role that this form of stress relief has in a sex life, and it can be additional to your couple sex life. 

On the flip side, when additional play is the only way a person expresses their desires, or this behavior is affecting sex quality and frequency, then a discussion is probably worth having about how to have both a sex life and additional play I.e how much is too much, what limits are there such as is porn ok but no Omegle sex, or maybe private cam shows are ok but no c2c...Whatever limits needed to create safety and freedom within them. And definitely talking about fears and reassuring your partner will work a whole lot better than shrugging it off and letting your partner obsess over it.

If couples had these conversations then I think there would be less posts about hurt feelings and trust being violated. It seems like a hassle or too confronting to have those talks for some people, but it is certainly worth it for openness, trust, and sexual satisfaction in your relationship.

50,50,How to deal with the desire to see sex workers,1,fyz7cs,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/fyz7cs/how_to_deal_with_the_desire_to_see_sex_workers/,2,"Hello all :)

Brief introduction: 25 year old Canadian male. About 3 months ago in late January, I lost my virginity to a sex worker at a massage parlour here in Montreal. I had been a virgin who had never been intimate with a female in any way whatsoever. I badly wanted to know what sex felt like. Before giving in, I had fought hard to prevent myself from going to this massage place (debated the idea in my head for 5 months and kept pushing through until I couldn't handle it anymore and decided to go one day no matter what). The next day, I went again and had sex with another masseuse . Right after these encounters, I felt deep shame and guilt, which have since subsided. In fact looking retrospectively at these experiences at the moment, they  were good experiences that I still reminisce vividly about. Up until this day, I have been battling the urges to do it again. I still have not gone back or seen a sex worker ever since. Yet the urges have been very strong to do it once more.

There are a number of reasons why I have been trying to prevent myself from engaging in a third encounter. First, in Canada where I live, paying for sex is illegal but selling sex is not. Generally police don't care about consenting adult prostitution but since the law exists, you never know when their priorities may change. As such, I have been scared to death of the off chance of getting busted and arrested for purchasing sex. Tbh, it seems the chances of this happening are low since police are mostly busy with dealing with trafficking and situations where minors are involved instead but that is only an educated guess and not an objective analysis. Erotic massage parlours offering sex in Canada are everywhere and flourishing across the country. Yet, since the law exists and the possibility of getting arrested for something like this is totally frightening to me (it would be a fate worse than death for me), I have been trying not to take my chances with the law even if the risk is low. Yet the urges are super strong and there are times where I feel I have no choice but to succumb to them. Currently, thanks to covid19, these places appear to be temporarily closed and at the same time, I am doing my part self-isolating and that also means a no to hiring sex workers or meeting any person. My concern, however, is that these urges will be much harder to fight when the pandemic ends and things get back to normal. The covid19 excuse will be lifted and I will be tempted so hard to go again and risk a low and spontaneous chance of arrest. Hiring a sex worker for an outcall appears to be much safer legality wise since the police are not really going to come to your home and conduct a sting. Yet, the anxiety of inviting a stranger to your home far supersedes the anxiety of going to a discrete establishment which offers these services and which I have already done twice.

I am quite lonely and never been in a relationship in my life. It will take some time to work on things I need to work on for that to happen (getting in shape, improving social skills around girls). I have already started working on these things and I am not discounting getting into a relationship in the future. But it may take time. Say a few years at the very least to get into a more confident position, physically and mentally. I also do not want to seek a relationship for the sole purpose of satisfying my sexual urges or for the sole purpose of sex because by definition that wouldn't really be a loving relationship. The idea of getting into a relationship to me seems to be a way to circumvent the sexual urges and render them as no longer relevant by eclipsing them with something that feels so much better (say mutual love, caring for someone else etc). But given the chance that this possibility may take time to materialize if it is ever even destined to happen, the real issue seems to be how I will be able to deal with my very strong sexual urges in the meantime. Can I really completely block those urges for a few years at least when I am finally ready to put myself out there. Getting sex organically seem to not be an option. As I said, I am out of shape, lack confidence, and self-esteem. I also don't feel comfortable trying to manipulate people into having sex with me. That sounds quite creepy and may be unwelcome. You also never know what a random person's attitudes to sex are. Some girls may simply not be into it and thus it may be quite offensive especially also that sex is quite taboo in many cultures. A sex worker on the other hand is upfront about sex and the arrangement is quite direct as what its goals are. Which is why it seems to have been the most logical option to pursue in order to fulfill my desires. Obviously it is quite expensive but I can choose to do it at very spaced intervals (say every 6 months) and save for it by spending less on things I don't much need. But, then again, the legal situation is so complicated and hazy that I feel so uneasy and uncomfortable going that route.

A third option is to find a way to block my sexual urges completely. So far, I have been doing that by taking walks/reading interesting books whenever the urges happen and they tend to work but I am not going to lie, sometimes the urges are super strong and particularly in the morning when my libido is highest. Can I really hang on to these urges for years? I question my ability to do that. How will I deal with my loneliness and low self-esteem in the meantime? I mean a main reason why seeing sex workers seemed a good option to me was the possibility that it may fix my shyness around girls and boost my very low self-esteem by giving me some validation. The fact that a woman allowed me to be intimate with her even if artificially so still did something to my super low self-esteem. I liked the interactions I had with the sex workers I saw. I treated them super nicely and they told me I was quite respectful to them. They were happy and friendly . And I still reminisce happily about those interactions I had. They were very intimate and taught me things about sex. So, I am left wondering why the taboo exists around consenting adults sharing moments like this together just if an exchange of money is involved. By doing so, I am also supporting sex workers and their work. Given that the law exists however criminalizing any purchase of sexual services, I feel I should not take my chances with the law further however.

How would you act in a situation like this? I am totally lost as to what I should do and how to proceed forwards in my life.

I am in not in a very good state mentally since I have been going through a lot, first the stress around my first sexual experience took long to dissipate and I have been thinking deeply and been having a lot of intrusive thoughts about what I did and examining what I want in life, so please if you have any negative comments or insults, I would really appreciate it if you don't leave them here. My poor mental state cannot handle any more negativity (I spent a lot of time crying the past few months) :( I am trying to be a better person I promise you.

Whether talking about women's desire in this forum or with a partner, having a thoughtful intimate conversation about what turns women on can be therapeutic and beneficial. A couple of my favorite quotes:

""owing to the greater culture, women hold themselves back, condemn their fantasies, foreclose on what they really want and sell themselves short on the idea that sex and love must look a certain way.""

""sexuality was framed in terms of accessing delight and accepting nonconformity""

""sexual healing had little to do with tricks or techniques, and almost everything to do with the mind, with sensing an internal flicker of I want that ‚Äì and feeling empowered to act accordingly.""

I'm (18M) confused about this. My gf (18) has a different way to see sex than I, sex is a topic we didn't touch until we started our relationship, not even in jokes and that's because I was always fearing about her reaction. She was clear when we talked about it, she isn't interested in sex, she takes like a form of disrespect any form of psysical contact with a sexual intention, she sees sex but only from a ""reproductive function"" perspective, also, she doesn't like the idea to have sex, then break, meet other guy, have a relationship with him, then have sex, break... And so on, and so on. She would like to wait to be married to the man she would like to be all the rest her life with, for, finally, have sex with him. I respect (because I believe she has some points) and I'm trying to learn to love the way of think she has about this, which is pretty different to mine, because I don't only see sex from a reproductive perspective, I see it like a form (not the definitive) of intimacy, give love, moment of vulnerability and connection, etc. And not only for me or one party, but for both. She's also a bit ""cold"" when it comes to psysical contact and I'm someone who likes and craves it, not in a needy way, but, you know.. I like to be touched like every human being. Sometimes I just feel like my body turns numb or it hurts because of this lack of psychical contact, also, we don't see us often, only twice every month in the best case escenario; I know it hurts her too, I'm not trying to play a victim here, I'm just confused about what should I do, because I love her and I respect her way of see that topic, but I also feel bad, I feel pain because I need to hide a part of myself. And I want to be clear with something, I didn't ask or demand her to have sex, we just talked about the topic and that's all.
This is my first relationship that is going well  (because the previous ones always ended with me being treated like an object of distraction and psychological support lol) and I don't want to screw it up. I didn't know if this was the correct sub to post this, so... If I need to do it in other sub, I will. 

TL;DR: My gf sees sex from a reproductive perspective, she doesn't want to have sex or any way of psysical/sexual contact/touch. Not because I asked/demanded her to have sex, but because we talked about the topic. I like and crave psysichal contact, and, even if I'm trying to respect her position, it hurts me that I need to hide a part of myself from her. I don't know what should I do.",1583790101.0
55,55,Thinking about getting a divorce due to lack of desire to have sex of her part,11,esejzf,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/esejzf/thinking_about_getting_a_divorce_due_to_lack_of/,35,"I (M25) am married to my wife (32F) since just about a year by now, we are together for 4 years this spring.

TLDR: She lost almost all interest in Sex and I am feeling the growing urge to cheat on her / break up because of this.

My wife is my second ever serious relationship. I always had a high sex drive, though, it seemed normal for a 16 to 20 year old guy. When I met my now wife, she had a noticeably lower sex drive compared to my previous girlfriends (possibly due to her being somewhat older than them, always dated girls 1-3 years younger than myself). I went through a rather hard time personally, my wife helped me overcome this. During this time, sex was not my first concern in any way. I am somewhat over this and married my wife last year.

Since then, our relationship started to ""normalize"" as we both found jobs, activities etc. and I don't struggle with my psychological health anymore. Since then, my sex drive has returned to where it was when I first met her. Hers, however, has gone down to basically zero. We have spoken about this, though never in great detail, but she definitively knows that it bothers me and that it is a lingering problem. She does however not know that I am thinking about getting a divorce because of this.

To specify the situation: I am doing my absolute best to appear desirable to her. While I always did sports, I am now in the best shape of my life (never had a sixpack before, noticeably gained \~10kgs of muscle since the start of our relationship), grew my hair long on her advice (with my beard I resemble a 192cm tall version of John Snow by now), changed my clothing style to something she likes (mostly business casual and minimal clothing in basic colours) and try to be seductive by bringing her gifts, cooking, doing housework, massaging her neck/back/feet etc. Alas, this is all to no avail.

We used to have sex circa 3-5 times a week, with her giving me a BJ once or twice on top of that. While my sex drive, if I am left on my own, usually brings my to masturbate twice a day, I was absolutely satisfied with that amount of sex. Since a good year, we have zero sex on her initiative. The few times we had sex was more her having pity with me and ""giving in"" while noticeably not enjoying the act. I did not enjoy this either, as sex for me is more about bonding, cuddling, romantic tension etc. and only secondary about bodily relief. I miss this emotional bonding, body to body contact and intense romance very much. I never pressure her into sex, but the only way I can have it is by basically asking her to lay down as a favour for me, which I found so repugnant that I'd rather have none at all.

I am thinking about breaking up the marriage as soon as possible because I know I will not be able to stay faithful or happy in this constellation. Also, I know she will want to have children eventually, and I do not want to complicate the situation further before coming to a result I know I would be happy with living with for the rest of my life. While I have not cheated on her, I have more than enough possibilities to do so, even without actively looking for them (working in a setting where I meet a lot of mostly young people, from body language I'd say I see multiple women at least mildly interested in me every week).

The problem is that besides this one problem I really love her, we share a lot of interests and complement each others personalities really well. I have pretty much from the start been imagining a future where we grow old together because I enjoy being with her so much. While I do not have much to compare this with, I am certainly the happiest I have ever been with her in every other regard besides the topic.

I am more looking for general advice here, maybe from someone who also got divorced because of this or who overcame such an issue. Is sex less of a topic once one grows older or is lack of sex normal in a marriage?

I could pretty much write a book about our dead bedroom journey but that this would take way too much time and nobody would want to read this much text. So I'll just skip to the latest events. 

For some reason the last Talk‚Ñ¢ actually changed something. For whatever reason this time it worked out and we managed to have sex about one or two times a week. This went on for 2-3 months until I started to lose interest in sex with her altogether. I honestly don't feel the urge to have sex with her as I felt before. All my desire for her basically vanished. We're now without sex for close to one month and I don't care too much about it.

I started to think about why this actually happened. Unfortunately I realized it's way more than just simple and plain sex that I was missing and that it's something you cannot just ask your partner for.

Every time we had sex I still had to initiate. I still was the driving force that led to us to having sex. I was the one sharing my interest, telling her how much I desire her. While she rejected me less than before she never showed some interest on her own. She never gave me a feeling of being actually wanted, that she needs me. And it just drains you. 

I do consider myself a good husband, I care for her, I do respect her, I try to be a better person for her and whenever we have sex I'll try my best to make her feel attractive, loved and desired. But I don't feel that this is mutual. 

Whenever we have sex, I personally have the urge to rock her world. Simply because my biggest turn on is to see her letting herself go, enjoying the moment, feeling confident in her sexuality. And looking back at our entire relationship I cannot think of a single moment where I felt that she tried to rock my world. It's always me pleasing her, never her pleasing me. 

I miss the feeling of previous relationships where you could openly share your sexual desires. Experiment with each other without feeling weird for even trying the most basic non-vanilla things.  I miss the feeling of having a girlfriend letting me know that she's craving me, no matter what. I miss the feeling of a girlfriend getting exited telling me a naughty fantasy of hers. I miss looking into the eyes of a women who knows that tonight memories will be made.

Has any other guy experienced this?,0,fr89i8,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/fr89i8/attempting_auto_fellatio_led_to_intense_bi/,2,"As a young guy I tried unsuccessfully to auto-fellate myself and as a result had many an intense orgasm, sometimes depending on the build-up, filling my mouth with the white stuff.  I‚Äòd always feel shame about it afterwards.  But the desire would return after a few days and I‚Äôd try again.   
Eventually, I reconciled that I‚Äôd probably never get to suck myself and would have to be happy with shooting my juice into my mouth and having my girlfriend do the actual sucking.  Often with various girlfriends I‚Äôd deeply kiss them after they swallowed my load.  It would make me hard again to taste my cum on their lips.  One girlfriend would save some for me and was turned on by my desire to taste my own cum.   
A few years ago a divorced friend came out to me and said he‚Äôd been sucking cocks and getting blowjobs from guys for years. I was surprised when he told me he‚Äôd always wanted to do it with me.  It took me a while, but I realized it was something I wanted, had always wanted to do, to get a hard cock into my mouth.    
My first time was incredible.  He had a short thick cock and after just a little while licking and taking the head and a couple inches of his shaft into my mouth, I was so hard I could barely keep my hands off myself.  I was sucking him slowly and deeply and it was so intensely arousing that I was gripping my cock, trying not to cum.  He was clearly enjoying my efforts even though I was a novice and gave me a verbal warning that he was about to cum.  I welcomed it and gently sucked as he spurted again and again, filling my mouth. At that point I was cupping and massaging his balls and stroking his shaft, milking the last drops from him and I just started cumming, with no stimulation, feeling the intense spamming, oozing and then shooting several thick ropes of semen all over.    
I‚Äôm still very much attracted to and sexually active and satisfied with women.  However, whenever I get together with my divorced buddy when he cums in my mouth, I just cum.  I can‚Äôt help it.  Does anyone else experience this?",1585527046.0

Ever since my frenulectomy (10 months ago) I‚Äôve been having issues. Right now it‚Äôs mainly erectile dysfunction, and trouble maintaining erections. Before when I got aroused, blood rushed in instantly and made me hard as a rock, now that does not happen, it merely trickles in. Getting aroused is pretty much impossible, and it feels like I lack any sexual drive whatsoever. Erections also feel different than before. I can‚Äôt really feel the ‚Äúhardness‚Äù like I could before. Like I know when I am erect and can ‚Äúflex‚Äù my penis still but if I were just to stand up erect without pants on I would not know I was erect. It‚Äôs also dryer if that makes any sense, even though the foreskin still covers it. It feels like it is nowhere near as moist as it used to be, and I actually started using lube for the first time.

The weird thing is that it still feels good down there. Where the frenulum used to be, and the corona region are still the most sensitive parts. It‚Äôs not as sensitive as before, but that is to be expected. My biggest frustration is it feels like threshold of arousal is much higher, causing legit erectile dysfunction. And it‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt had the proper stimulus, I‚Äôve made out with some very attractive girls but there is still little response down there. 

Can anyone offer any possible answers? This has been terrible for my mental health. I know I‚Äôm not an asexual, I had a normal drive and arousal before, but now there is not much. I am 19, relatively fit, and in college. I‚Äôm also in a fraternity too so I have plenty of access to girls, I just feel so limited by this problem. My sexual confidence is so low, and I would absolutely love to fix this. I had an appointment at Mass General Hospital in their ED clinic but they canceled due to coronavirus fears. 

The only thing I can think of is some kind of nerve damage, but it seems like a hard procedure to fuck up that bad. It wasn‚Äôt even a full circumcision, just the frenulum. Pretty much everyone even who got a full circumcision seem to be fine. I can even ejaculate in less than 5 minutes when masturbating, so i can‚Äôt see it being a sensitivity thing. Unless he dug around in there a bunch I can‚Äôt see it. It still feels good when masturbating, there‚Äôs just no drive to actually have sex. It‚Äôs like being an asexual, but knowing you are not an asexual and just want your sex life back.",1584276963.0

I have had many different sexual partners, mainly one-night stands, who i pretty much always end up regreting. Not bc I didn't want to spend the night with them, but bc I didn't actually want sex. I have come to the conclusion that what i desire is closeness, like cuddling, kissing and perhaps what one would call foreplay, but that the sex that usually comes with this is something I would rather avoid. The problem is I have no clue how to communicate this to future partners and dates in fear of dissapointing them or looking like a wimp.

A good example of this is yesterday when I met a girl at a party who I quite liked and we ended up getting close and going to my place. While we were cuddling it was clear that she wanted more so I told her that she seemed too drunk compared to me and that it then didn't feel right (which too be fair, was probably true). In reallity I mainly didn't want to have sex and was really happy with the cuddling up to this point. She continued to playfully pressure me into it but I held my ground. I felt so guilty, like I dissapointed her, so when we woke up the morning after I caved in and told her she was now sober enough and we did it...

I really would love some advice on this as i still go to parties, clubs or the like wanting to find dates, only to regret it when I realize what I'll probable have to do.",1582008214.0

Disclaimer though. None of what I'm about to say deeply affects my life. I'm not sexually addicted or depressed. Also please don't PM me. This isn't an invite. 

I think I'm an emotional fapper. I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/fjvgtp/addicted_to_jerking_off_to_the_same_women_but_im/) about this but basically every year or so I get a huge crush on like a celebrity and only way to express that is fapping. Orgasm is one of the most pleasurable feelings and knowing that someone has the power to make me feel this good is just super sexy to me. 

Now the weirder stuff is here. I also find it sexy knowing she can make a man feel that way period. So honestly seeing other guys talk about how sexy the celeb is or fapping and cumming to her is fun to me. I've tried watching dudes jerk off with no women involved and I hate that so I know it's because of the celeb. Seeing pics of the celeb covered in cum to me symbolizes the power she has over other men. It's just so damn sexy knowing one woman can have that much power over so many guys. 

Anyway reality of this is most these women probably don't see it that way and shouldn't. Some go too far. The stuff I don't like are the non-consentual fantasies or worse actual unsolicited pics and vids. I can't relate to that. I can relate to the guys that just wanna talk about how attractive and sexy a woman is. Honestly I've been considering doing that privately recently. It's just a combination of me being an emotional fapper and I guess it being such a repressed thing. I mean it should be repressed since there's real people involved which is why I want to make it private convos with other dudes that can relate. I mean it's still weird to do privately but at least it's private right? This is what I've been thinking about recently. I've been asking around about discord and stuff cause I've just been curious about knowing if anyone else sees things so intimately.

I need advice and thank you in advance for taking the time to help me.

I‚Äôve been in what is normally a good relationship for over a year and a half now. However, in the last six month our intimate side of the relationship has become really poor. She simply is hardly interested in being intimate with me anymore. It makes me feel sad, frustrated, and overall now that I‚Äôm watching myself write these words, upset. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm an inattentive boyfriend. I dote on her all the time, constantly keep our place clean and tidy, I do our laundry most of the time and put it all away for the both of us, I cuddle her, give her foot rubs every night. I truly love her and try to make her feel that too. I also listen and remember what she says and likes and in turn do thoughtful things and buy her thoughtful gifts that I know she wants. However, in an area where I need to feel loved in return I don‚Äôt and it‚Äôs starting to hurt now. It‚Äôs making me really insecure. I‚Äôll admit I gained a little weight, around 20 pounds but I was in good shape before that and still look okay. I know I have an average size penis of 6 inches and medium girth that I‚Äôm also really insecure about especially since my previous wife cheated on me with a man who had an enormous one. Regardless, I always make sure she has at least one orgasm during sex and do all sorts of nice things to her including a lot of oral. She never wants to give me oral even though I always give her that. I try to be a really attentive lover and friend. I don‚Äôt know what is happening. It just seems like she would rather be on her phone looking up Reddit posts than have a fun time with me. I don‚Äôt know what to do, it's not like I‚Äôm losing motivation for the relationship and I don‚Äôt want to lose what we have but I also don‚Äôt want to live like this either. It's hard being sexually denied. We don‚Äôt have a mortgage or kids yet. It just seems to me like this is a sign that things will only be worse regarding this matter later in life if we continue down the road we are traveling. I just feel sad and undesired and it hurts. I really don‚Äôt know what else I could give her other than have $12,000 worth of surgery to make myself look like the guy from Witcher who she admitted to having a dream about. I know I‚Äôm not dream worthy but it would be nice to feel wanted two or three times per week. Ideally I would want sex once a day but I‚Äôve compromised to around three but even that doesn‚Äôt happen. At this point I‚Äôm lucky to be intimate with her once per week.

Does anyone know how to reactivate a woman‚Äôs sexual desire for her man before I start crying myself to sleep out of sexual frustration?

I usually get off from trib/humping  her because it takes no effort on her part and that‚Äôs usually just to relieve myself enough to forget about it. 


She says sex is very enjoyable but she doesn‚Äôt need it often. She doesn‚Äôt desire or crave sex.

Every girl I've dated has either liked guys more or ended up falling back on a guy. Every sexual experience I've had with a girl has been mostly drunk and in the moment, not necessarily out of pure lust or desire. I haven't dated a woman in years, and don't even know if I would consider my middle/high school experiences as necessarily dating because of the lack of intimacy.

Here's my point - I've pushed back my desires to be sexual with women for a while now because it's just so damn hard and so few and far between. I feel like I've tried every avenue I possibly can to get more sexual attention from women - dating apps, swinger clubs, LGBT clubs, etc. 

Tonight it just really came to a head when I went to a swinger club as a single woman (a unicorn for those who don't know... the mystical creature that apparently every couple wants). I approached every couple that I was interested in first and none of them seemed to flirt back. No one that I was interested in approached me first. I was sitting alone in a corner for hours, would circle around the club, rinse and repeat. I felt so desperate.

I finally just decided fuck it and went to a strip club. I had some extra moola, I at least want some attention from women. Bought some dances, it helped me a little bit... until I asked one woman if I could buy a dance from her and she said one second, walked away from me then came back 10 minutes later circling around the club trying to find guys to buy her a dance without coming back to me.

And look, I know the rational part of me says this woman might have just been trying to find guys that will give her more money than I would have, that it's not personal, but with everything else I just thought damn, I can't even pay a woman to pay attention to me.

I know this is how a lot of guys feel all the time, I'm not trying to take away from your experience. But in these couple contexts I just felt so on the outside - at the swingers club, I'd watch couples dancing and mingling with each other and they all just felt so in place. Then at the strip club I'd watch as the dancers seduced the men that they were with... effortlessly.

No one approached me first. Not even at the strip club.

I almost wish that I was just straight. It really sucks to say but I do. It just seems like everybody has a sexual outlet besides women who like women. I want to be seduced by a woman. I want to be approached first by a woman. Will that always be too much to ask for?

I'm considering getting a sugar baby. It sounds so fucking dumb even saying it because I'm literally 24 but I have a little bit of disposable income and I know I could probably find somebody interested. I just feel this major part of myself not being fulfilled. It's like an emptiness that just never seems to be satisfied because I feel so undesired by women.

I just need some advice or help or words of wisdom or something. Even just people who can relate. I feel like I should be at the point in my life where finding these type of things should be easy - I'm definitely not a model but I'm fit, healthy, feminine, and put a lot of effort into my look and body. I'm realistic and don't only shoot outside my league.

What do I do?

TLDR: What can I do to get more sexual attention from women where they will actually be the people approaching first occasionally or pursuing, or do I just have to accept that as a woman who likes women I'm always going to have to do the initial labor?",1577035209.0

I have told him this and he was apologetic, but I still feel like now when he comes in me it‚Äôs only for a quickie, whereas we used to have these long sex sessions followed by mutual masturbation.

She has a low libido, and it seems she needs to get turned on before she desires sex.  The problem is that she has to consciously let me ""try"" to arouse her.  So how do I let her know that I'd like to have sex that day, so that she can start getting herself into the frame of mind that I could do something to arouse her, without her just saying no? 

If I leave it to the end of the day when we're going to bed to try to initiate, she'll say no 6/7 times.  We tried scheduling sex, but that did not work for us at all.",1580732858.0

I was with 3 women consistently and couple others on and off. Every single one of these women told me how I was the nicest guy they‚Äôve ever met and one thought that I had feelings for her based on the way I was treating her. 

So what is it about me that makes me the nicest guy ever? Well I told them they didn‚Äôt have to have sex with me or do anything they didn‚Äôt want to do. That‚Äôs it. Oh and I cared whether or not they got. Apparently this is uncommon in fwb relationships. 

I think a lot of people forget about the friends part of fwb. I understand there is a fear you will catch feelings for someone but mutual respect and caring are important for any human relationship. I think a lot of guys don‚Äôt understand how difficult it can be for young women to trust people with their bodies. Society has a habit of repressing women‚Äôs sexual desires at a very young age. While for guys sex is encouraged at every turn. For many(not all) it‚Äôs easy for men to get involved with someone intimately, but for women(not all) it can be a lot harder to trust someone like that. 

What I‚Äôm trying to say here is that FEELING empathy, and having respect for someone and their body is perfectly acceptable In a fwb type relationship. Frankly it should be a prerequisite.",1589675079.0

I became very religious and very strict about sex. I felt guilty about masturbation, and the gap between them takes two to three months, every time getting a week feeling ashamed about doing it. I didn't even wanted to make sex to the girlfriend I had at the time, we dated almost a year and we never made it. After I lose my vision of my left eye, I felt different. Like, I started to questions things again, but even now that I doesn't have any kind of faith to hold me up, the way I freaked out about it before made me feel insecure and ashamed. Is like sex desire is associated to something bad that I did to myself. Because I feel guilty just to have sexual desires. Just to see a woman and get excited. Even when I just see a photo of a girl that turns me on I feel guilty. Is like sex became something traumatic. Something I fear. I talk to my therapist recently, but there is a lot of things happening in my life aside from that (I feel depressed and almost every time I am suffering from anxiety from other more urgent things). Something do not mentioned before is that I feel, even if I know that this doesn't exist, like that bad things happen because of it.

I am okay with any sex position, but my favourites are missionary and prone. I want to feel his weight on me, not so much that it crushes me, but enough.

I want it even when he finishes. Especially if we did a position where I didn't get to feel him as much (e.g. doggy style). 

Once he finishes I'll have my arms wrapped around him and ask him to stay for a while. I don't know what it is, but it just makes me feel safe and secure. I also like feeling him inside me, which may sound stupid, but I like the feeling of him throbbing, which he does for a while after cums. He humours me by staying, but admitted to me last week that he thinks it's a little weird and hasn't had another girl want this.

This took me back a little and made me feel self conscious about it, so I stopped asking. But he has noticed and has been staying on me after sex, even when I don't ask, assuring me that he thinks it's cute. I know he didn't mean to upset me at all, and he's been a lot more affectionate and thoughtful lately. Like usually we could be in doggy style, and then after he finishes we would lie with him ontop of me. But now he has started to change position before he finishes, e.g. we will be in doggy, but he will push me down into a prone position to finish with his weight on me. I know he is trying a lot to make me feel comfortable again and I really appreciate him for that.

I just want to know...am I being weird? He has assured me that he will do whatever I want if it makes me happy. But I don't want to come across as clingy or anything. This is my first serious relationship, and he is so good to me. But he does have more experience than me, and I dont want to mess up over little things.

I know I am probably overthinking this, but I'm just looking for some outside opinions. Whatever is said probably wont change how much I like it, and I know he isn't going to stop doing it for me. I'm just looking to see if I'm alone in this aha.

Please help.,14,dwv4j1,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dwv4j1/is_it_possible_to_abandonchange_your/,23,"Let me start by saying I know I'm a trash ass husband for this. Please... I'm fully admitting this is my problem, not hers. Have mercy.

I'll get right to it: I LOVE fake boobs. I dont know why. The only explanation I have is when I was 14, the first breasts I saw irl were fake and I was mesmerized. Other than that, I have no good explanation.

My wife and I started dating very young. She is beautiful and I love her dearly.

But I always had a fake boob fetish. It's not that they're large, it's literally knowing silicone is under her breast. Given the choice between a natural C and a fake C cup, I'm picking the fake. I know. Its stupid.

My wife is aware of this, and its come up a few times through the years.  But it makes her feel bad. So a few years ago, I put it to bed. Told her I didnt want her to do it and had no desire for them anymore.

But... I was kinda lying. I just didnt want her to hurt or resent me. That was and is more important to me.

For a few years, I actually thought I had moved on. I preferred porn with fake breasted women, but I didnt have a burning desire for my wife to get them.

But heres the thing: we had our first child, and he really did a number on her body... to give you an idea, he was born weighing over 10 pounds.

Now this burning desire for her to get fake breasts has planted itself in me and I cant shake it. And I find myself thoroughly unfulfilled in the bedroom now.

I know how horrible that makes me. How shallow I am.

So I'm not asking for advice on getting her to get fake breasts. To be honest, I know if I asked she would. Beyond a shadow of a doubt.

But even thinking about asking her makes me feel like scum. But this desire just will not let go of me. And right now, I cant imagine going the next 50 years without experiencing my fetish. It just burns in me too much.

But I know that isnt something you can ask of a person. I know its wrong.

So I'm asking for advice on how to change my desire. Is it possible to shed this kink/fetish for fake breasts? 

And if not, has anyone had a long and happy marriage while feeling like their biggest sexual desire was off the table? Any advice on how to make that work?

And please... do be kind. I'm really reaching out knowing how shitty of a husband I am. I beat myself up over this constantly, so now I'm turning to internet strangers for help.

Oh, and cheating/experiencing this fetish outside of the marriage is off the table. Just thought I'd throw that out there.",1573872835.0

As the titles states, I would really appreciate having insight into how you all felt or would feel if this topic arose? Bfs who know how their gfs felt, I‚Äôd love your insight as well. I have mentioned my desires to my gf, and she was... not for it. Which, frankly, surprised me. I would think, if given the opportunity to upgrade from the ‚Äúsalad bar‚Äù to the ‚Äúall-you-can-eat‚Äù section, and the restaurant would be totally fine with it‚Äîheck, wouldn‚Äôt even charge ya for it‚Äî then you‚Äôd be all for it, right? Plus, in the past she has (jokingly) expressed how hot a threesome with Shawn Mendez would be, which I thought at least hinted at some slight comfort with the prospect.

I will add that my gf is a very shy and socially anxious person, but she has been working on this, and has been improving.  Nevertheless. She said she would feel weird and awkward if it was with a guy she knew. She also wasn‚Äôt keen on it being with a guy she didn‚Äôt know. She didn‚Äôt give specifics on why not with a guy she didn‚Äôt know. 

I am her first everything, and her tastes are definitely more ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù then mine. I have tried to incorporate some things into our sex life to help warm her up to the idea. Often, we will just mutually masturbate, with the emphasis being on her being pleasured and me just watching. I‚Äôve also introduced a dildo, and spit roasting with the dildo, which she seemed to enjoy at first, but then lost interest in that as well. She did admit to me that she found one of my friends attractive, which I saw as a big step for her since she dodged the question for a little bit.  Sometimes, if she‚Äôs in the mood, she will also play with ‚Äúcontrolling‚Äù my pleasure, eg. riding me, and sucking me without allowing me to touch her, or making me just watch her masturbate without touching myself. 

I had also suggested that we write an erotic story together about cuckolding/mmf play, which she agreed to at first, but then changed her mind. 

She had mentioned that she may be open to the idea in the future. I‚Äôm just wondering how I can go about easing her into this in the most comfortable way for her. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs just something I‚Äôm not understanding from the female side of this. Perhaps I can ‚Äúrepackage‚Äù my desires, or try new avenues of gentle approach, as I have tried to do with dildos, pleasure control, etc? Thank you.

I feel like we're way too young to be having issues with a dead bedroom. Been together just over a year now, became physical very early in the relationship and despite a bit of awkwardness at the beginning (we were each others firsts) everything was great; we both had fairly high libidos so, despite multiple obstacles (parents at home, only seeing each other twice a week) we had sex as regularly as possible (once a week/every two weeks) - this seems low to some but it's the most we could fit in time wise. There was also plenty of ""fooling around"" in between.

More recently, however, we can go months at a time without having sex or even being intimate at all. Admittedly, time has gotten even tighter and we've both been ill a couple of times but there have been plenty of perfect opportunities to have sex and, despite me trying to make the first move, he either said he wasnt feeling up to it or subtly moved away. I never pushed it and, after a few attempts, stopped trying altogether as I didn't want to push it if he didn't feel comfortable.

I've tried to talk about him about this a few times but I'm not entirely sure on how to approach the subject. I mentioned it a few months ago (around late October time) after going over a month without sex and the next time I saw him he brought condoms and we went at it but I can't help but feel like he only did it because he felt obligated to because I'd said something - he seemed to enjoy it and finished, but has not initiated much since.

Sex used to be thoroughly enjoyable for us both at the start of the relationship (therefore I am sure he is not asexual or anything of the sort) and we purchased a vibrator to spice things up a bit. It's barely been touched since the first couple of uses and is at his house - whilst trying to be understanding of his feelings, I have needs that aren't being met. Would it be wrong of me to ask to have the vibrator for my own use? He bought it but it was for our use as a couple. I think asking for it might be a way of bringing up the conversation again but want to avoid hurting his feelings.

On the other hand, I am fairly certain he is still somewhat being satisfied as he previously admitted to masturbating very frequently and I am almost certain he still does it now. Him masturbating isn't an issue for me but I can't help but feel a little bit hurt that he still goes through with it yet has no desire to be intimate with me. It's really starting to affect my self image now. This may bring suggestions that he's simply not into me anymore but without wanting to seem like I'm in denial, I really don't think this is the case - he evidently still loves me greatly and puts in great amounts of effort into all other aspects of the relationship. He is frequently ""flirty"" (calling me sexy, telling me I look good etc.) But it's the lack of flowing through to intimacy that's bothering me.

So. Any ideas on what's causing this behaviour and how I can help him through it/make him desire me again? How should I approach the conversation? Is it wrong for me to ask for the vibrator? All help is appreciated.",1578525970.0

We both have had only one other, short-lived, sexual partner before each other. We have sex regularly and both make efforts to keep things fresh and exciting in the bedroom. We indulge each other‚Äôs fantasies and sexual preferences within personal bounds and are both happy with our sexual relationship. 

However, I often feel that I missed out on some formative sexual experiences because I‚Äôve been in an exclusive relationship since senior year of high school and all throughout college. I love my wife and I don‚Äôt regret being in a relationship or marrying her, but sometimes I can‚Äôt help but think that I cheated myself out of the benefits of having sexual experiences with a variety of partners. My sexual FOMO has driven me far enough to occasionally fantasize about cheating. I‚Äôll never take steps toward it, though, and I feel awful for thinking about it at any point.

I want to talk to my wife about these feelings that I‚Äôm struggling with so we can work out a solution together but it terrifies me to bring it up. She‚Äôs always had issues with self-esteem and confidence in her attractiveness despite consistent words of affirmation from me. In the past, she has jumped to conclusions about me not finding her sexually attractive. Recently, I asked if I could help shave her bikini area. She regularly shaves, I wasn‚Äôt suggesting that we do anything different, and we‚Äôve talked in the past about how I am perfectly happy with any level of hair on her body. However, this led to crying and talk about how I think she‚Äôs too hairy. The lack of confidence in herself also means that she doesn‚Äôt want me ever looking at porn. She feels that I would always be comparing her to pornstars even though I don‚Äôt feel that I‚Äôve ever given her a reason to think that would be the case.
My fear is that hearing about these feelings that I have will dissolve her trust in my love and attraction to her in an irreparable way. 

Based on past discussions, introducing other people into the bedroom is a no-go for her and the last thing I would ever want to do is end our happy marriage or cheat.

It's hard being stuck in one's own head all the time, so I'm just gonna throw some things out there, expose myself to you faceless internet strangers, and hope that perhaps you've overcame a similar struggle to mine.

To put simply, I have sexual desires - an impulse to FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! a lot of people - but internally I know it is wrong. It is not healthy for me, nor does it serve any purpose other than immediate gratification. It is risky. It is selfish. It is... not who I want to be.

It is like there are two sides to me. One is good, and it wants to find love and build a life with a beautiful woman, but the other one... well, this one ain't so good. I want to use people. Abuse people. Be abused by them. All to fulfil some depraved fantasy, to which there is no true end, only ceaseless indulgence. It's like a fire in my body, and it burns, and it hurts, and I don't know how to put it out. Don't know if I WANT to put it out, nor where to put it. So I live with this damn devil, and sometimes I'm so sure I've conquered it, until I see a girl in a bar, or get an impulse to watch porn, and my mind is flooded with thoughts of bodily fluids and skin and arousing shapes. Another personality has taken over, and all those things that I know are wrong, seem so right.

FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!

I grew up on porn. Mid 20s and I'm yet to have a girlfriend. Perhaps if I were with someone, I could direct my sexual energy towards her, but... well, there is no her. I guess I just answered my own question, that I should invest time in seeking out a partner. Yeah, I know, that. I know the answers. I know what I gotta do. The problem is that the other part of me doesn't give a shit about any of that stuff. Family, love, life - all that pales in comparison to the need to FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! until kingdom come.

Sometimes, I will have a dream, in which I'm with a woman. I see her in all her splendour. A good person who loves me. And I feel happy. And I care for her. But then I wake up, she's gone, I'm alone, and I've got morning wood.

FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!

Dear men/women or Reddit. Are you like me? Do you understand me? I don't understand myself, and I don't understand you people who have carefree sex. Swingers, whores, sluts. I don't like you, but I do want you. I wish we lived in a world where we could be sexually indiscriminate, and I could have FUN! FUN! FUN! with all of you sexual deviants, but with STDs and human emotions that just isn't possible. I wonder how so many people living in this ""hook-up culture"" are able to indulge their urge and be so promiscuous. Just give themselves to someone.

Maybe one day, when I'm in a committed relationship, I can stop doing some of these, or at least limit it, when I'm older and wiser and give less fucks, and I'm with someone I'm comfortable with, but that's not gonna happen anytime soon.

103,103,(F) I want to learn how to be the dominant sexual partner my boyfriend desires,3,ean3hk,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/ean3hk/f_i_want_to_learn_how_to_be_the_dominant_sexual/,10,"but have no experience in that area and neither does he. So when I ask him to describe how a scenario might play out in his imagination, he has trouble articulating specifics. He just knows he's very turned on by the idea of me being dominant with him sexually. I am very turned on by the idea of learning to be a powerful woman in the bedroom, not only to please him but for myself as well.

More context: we're both late 20s, straight monogamous couple, dating 6 months.

Doing some research, I've mainly come across tips that are either too basic for us (""kiss your man when he's not expecting it! be the one to initiate sex!"") or tips that are out-of-our-league intense and/or more geared toward the man being the dominant one.

So I'm posting here hoping for some general tips to use as a base for exploration with him, to start figuring out what we like. **Like some dirty talk phrases that can be said by a dominant lady to her submissive man? or some light beginner bdsm scenarios to try out?**

Maybe it seems I'm overthinking, and I should note I am treading super lightly because of two things:

* At times, he has trouble maintaining an erection (due to psych medication). He's very insecure about it. I've learned a lot about how best to proceed & keep the action going, so he doesn't psych himself out and shut down. But I'm lost on how to handle this while playing a dominant role.
* He wants me to try butt stuff on him (fingering, pegging) which I am open to but again, zero experience - but here's the thing: he confided in me that this desire comes from sexual abuse he endured as a child. I just want to handle this with as much care as possible, and I've never (knowingly) had a partner with sexual abuse in their past.

**I'm sure this all takes some trial and error to figure out, it's just I'd hate to inadvertently contribute to his insecurity or his trauma, and want to minimize that, so any tips would be so very welcome.**

104,104,Unable to connect sexual desire with emotional relationships,1,es6m0i,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/es6m0i/unable_to_connect_sexual_desire_with_emotional/,4,"Okay, so I (18f) am casually seeing this guy right now. I love spending time with him, he makes me laugh, he makes me happy. I think he‚Äôs attractive and I feel attraction for him. We‚Äôve been friends and I really like him. 

Last year, I was in an (unhealthy) relationship with a guy. He had a very different sense of humor than I do. But the first day I saw him I was like ‚ÄúI wanna bang‚Äù. I‚Äôd never had that reaction before. My previous relationships had started out as friendships that developed (such is the nature of highschool). So immediately I was caught off guard, because I really liked him, full crush, wanted to have sex. We eventually started dating. And I couldn‚Äôt do it. I didn‚Äôt like it when he‚Äôd touch me, I didn‚Äôt kiss him, we never -did- anything. But I wanted to. When he wasn‚Äôt there I‚Äôd wish I could kiss him. Just couldn‚Äôt go for it in the moment. Now I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt lose my virginity (stupid concept anyway) to him because he SUCKS as a human. 

Then there‚Äôs my friend. She‚Äôs grown to be almost my best friend, besides my childhood buddy. I love her. I love my friends because they matter to me, they‚Äôre close to me, I need them. But she‚Äôs different. I look at a sunset, my cat, and I LOVE them. I look at some flowers and I like them. With this girl I love her. It‚Äôs the same feeling. With my other friends I love them in a friend way, we hang out and have fun, I want them in my life. But with her, it‚Äôs definitely different which is hard to explain. I‚Äôve thought about kissing her, and she‚Äôs open to pursuing something with me fyi. But I can‚Äôt. Same thing, I freeze in the moment. I want to kiss people, but not really her because it‚Äôs her. There‚Äôs the emotional connection, she gets me and I love her and we complete eachother. Like crawling in bed, the sun is setting, soft music playing. But I don‚Äôt have attraction to her. She‚Äôs pretty. But I don‚Äôt feel desire specifically towards her, just the desire to have sex in general. Which is hard to accept. (I‚Äôve had sexual desire towards girls before, first kiss was a girl, I‚Äôm bisexual at least)

So I don‚Äôt know what to do, or how to feel. I have someone I really liked for a long time, who I like now and I‚Äôm attracted to. I‚Äôd like to touch him, kiss him. He makes me happy. But the situation isn‚Äôt perfect as we are both very busy right now and he is Mormon. Which causes some conflict but not because of differing views. Just different duties and life paths


With my friend, I feel so much love and a deep connection to. I‚Äôd call her soulmate material. We have the same Pinterest board aesthetic dreams of living on a French farm living the sunlight. But I feel no attraction to her. I‚Äôve tried and I can‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt desire her that way.

I‚Äôve felt desire before and I know what it‚Äôs like, she sparks none of it. I can‚Äôt combine emotional connection with physical desire in any relationship, despite the fact that I want to. I‚Äôm a sexual person, I like those thoughts and feelings. But I can never carry DO anything in the real moment. 

My love language is quality time. I like going to the pet shop and holding hands as we look at the fish. I like long drives, and starry nights. But I also like the pleasure of sexual activities. I can‚Äôt seem to fit them together. It‚Äôs annoying and upsetting. I want these things, biologically my body is like ‚Äúget knocked up‚Äù but I can‚Äôt get them. 

Tl;dr girl is unable to form intimate relationships with a balance between physical and emotional attraction. It‚Äôs distressing and she needs advice on how to proceed.",1579694948.0

So last year Oct-28th  my ex of 3 years sent me a snapchat one day like normal...When I opened the snap it was her being fucked by a guy who was way bigger than me. When confronted she said it was meant for her girlfriend....(more stuff happened but it's irrelevant) needless to say  the relationship ended . Im not gonna bore anyone with insecurities that arised from it cause its been talked about to death..  r/sex has helped me understand it with all the penis size subs. So thank you r/sex you help more than you know..However this is not my problem that Im facing atm or why I made this post. 

Here is the thing my sex drive is none existent anymore like complete zero I have no desire to have sex, and at times its a uncomfortable idea. It has gotten so bad I no longer get erections besides morning ones, even porn doesn't turn me on and has become a turn off now.

I wanted to talk about it but I don't like the idea of people in my personal life knowing this. 

I (F25) haven't been with anyone in any physical way in over a year and a half. The only only form of touch I've gotten are hugs from relatives/friends and a few drunken kisses on cheeks and foreheads. My last sexual experience was from a drunk guy who acted like a wolf, scratched up my back, and said sex with me wasn't exciting. To say I've been starved for physical intimacy up until my masturbation problem would be a complete understatement. I tried dating apps and only get people who make me uncomfortable. I even tried a few blind dates which ended with people ghosting me afterwords and basically telling the friends that hook us up that I just wasn't attractive. To be honest I do not believe I am ugly, I am just plainer compared to other girls.

Anyway, to say my self esteem hasn't been a bit hurt by all of this. Then I heard in a movie to help my self confidence was to touch myself; ""If you wouldn't do you then why would anyone else?"" Scared but willing to try anything I started doing the deed. Which slowly became almost a daily thing. It doesn't effect my work, social life, chores, sleep, or hobbies. I am pretty balanced with my schedule plus I have it all down to a science. The only thing it's done was completely kill my desire to be intimidate with a another person. I know this is common with porn addicts but I am not one. I was curious if anyone on here has the same problem and also to finally get it off my chest.",1575595308.0

(18M) have been dating this guy (19M) for about 4 months. We started off pretty slow, had our first kiss on date 3 and then became official boyfriends not long after that point. Since then we've cuddled, and shit too but have never done anything sexual.

We're both trans with body image issues and I have brought up sex before and we've had a short convo about how we feel about it. He said hes never had that strong desire and seems to be ok with remaining a virgin forever and I on the other hand do want to have sex, I'm just scared of it.

Its important to know that we're both also trans so that plays a factor. Neither of us have a penis and at least for me, that's an issue because I always imagine myself having a penis when I have sex.

Hes not as affectionate either and I kinda have to ""force"" certain forms of intimacy like kissing. He does have his own ways of showing affection tho, but hes told me that it's something hes struggled with.

I'm not really in a hurry to have sex or anything, but at the same time I'm scared that we're just gonna keep procrastinating. Im trying to change my own perspective on sex so I dont view it as such a big deal too. I'm thinking of bringing it up to him today and see if hes comfortable with maybe mutual masterbation in the near future. I don't want us to lag behind the ""traditional"" couple milestones but at the same time its more important that we're both comfortable.

Does anyone have any tips? Or at least maybe some stories similar to mine with a good ending lol? I'm not planning on leaving my boyfriend or anything, he makes me extremely happy, I just want to see if there are any sort of ways to go about this barrier we have around sex.

I‚Äôve pretty much had issues with sex ever since I realized people would start expecting it of me. I was fine with it being a fantasy and nothing more beforehand. But when it became ‚Äúreal‚Äù I was worried about being a huge disappointment. I didn‚Äôt feel attractive enough to be bad sex, knew I would be bad at it because I had no experience, and worried that whoever I was with would just leave me because of it.

Rationally, I know that‚Äôs not true and it hasn‚Äôt been the case for me, but I cannot convince myself to feel that way. 

My bf and I had a long talk about my problems regarding sex. He doesn‚Äôt want me to have sex I don‚Äôt want, I don‚Äôt want him to have a sexless relationship. 

I know part of the issue is I hold myself to an impossibly high standard. I‚Äôm totally turned off to sex if everything isn‚Äôt totally perfect with me (clean shaven all over, freshly showered, makeup, cute clothes, not sweaty, no acne, etc.) and if anything is out of place I just feel gross. However, it‚Äôs exhausting and often impossible to keep up with. 

I also have an intense fear of trying anything new sexually, particularly if it involves me being the center of attention in any way, or having to take initiative in any way. I feel so unnatural and clueless as to what to do. I‚Äôm torn between ‚Äúbeing myself‚Äù and ‚Äúdoing it right,‚Äù neither of which feels good to me. I feel like I need an extra five steps before the first step to trying anything new. I often hear ‚Äúyou just have to do it‚Äù but I just can‚Äôt, I freeze up, my mind blanks, I panic. And if I do give in and just try something, I don‚Äôt feel ready and then I end up not liking it at all. 

My bf and I both want to work on it but we‚Äôre both entirely clueless as to what to do. I feel like I can‚Äôt take things slower than I already am, or I‚Äôd be going in reverse. It‚Äôs annoying because I know my fears are dumb and that he won‚Äôt judge me at all, but in the moment I just can‚Äôt rationalize that even if I try.

(M20),0,ejcv9h,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/ejcv9h/is_it_okay_to_go_to_a_sexfetish_club_to_fulfil_a/,6,"Hi. I (20M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (19F) since 4.5 years. We got together after high school and have been leading a happy relationship ever since. In any case, no matter how good your relationship is, after certain yesrs you start questioning it - especially when you're a young person and this is your very first girlfriend, your very first sexual experience. As a curious and open-minded person, that doesn't get easier over time. Our sex is good but I always felt (and still feel) the desire for more. In my case, ""more"" is Anal (which she is okay with to try out but is not really into) and even further, I have a kink that's not really accepted among ""normal"" people, so we never got to experience that fetish together (the fetish is seeing the girl poop). I even managed to open up to her about this kink, she accepted it but we did not decide to try it one day. It was a weird moment but I was glad she didn't think I was a disgusting person bc of this odd fetish. I recently started studying in another city, with her still living where we originally lived. That certainly didn't make things easier and I feel like she's a bit more mature than me, already pushing towards living together and stuff, which i am not feeling ready for yet. It seems like our expectations for the future are pretty different: she wants the relationship to become more serious, and for me, in those 4.5 years, the desire of living the ""student's life"" and making other experiences, also sexually, has never been stronger than now. Paired with the odd fetish I can't really imagine to experience with her, that leaves me a bit worried about the future of our relationship. In the recent time I have been thinking a lot about arranging this fetish with a normal sex life, I googled a lot and found some special fetish/sex club that offers to fulfil my fetish (in a serious way, it's not an ominous brothel or something). I thought and fantasized about it a lot, leaving me absolutely aroused about this desire being finally fulfilled. Now, I wonder whether it is acceptable (from an ethical, moral point of view) to go and engage the services of such a club to fulfil this kink whilst being in a relationship or not, or if that's a thing only single people should do, and whether you would continue being in a relationship under the given circumstances.

TL;DR: Me (M20) and my girlfriend have been in a relationship since 4.5 years. I have a strange kink she accepts but we don't fulfil it in our sex life. I recently stumbled across a sex club offering to fulfil that fetish i've been having for yeara now. Is it morally acceptable to visit such a club whilst being in a relationship or is it considered cheating?",1578070565.0

I really do love her very much, but recently Ive been struggling with an issue that is difficult to talk about with any friends, so I‚Äôm reaching out here.


I am a people guy. I love talking and getting to know people because they are so damn interesting sometimes. When I meet a person I really do want to figure them out and get to know them as well as possible. This has always been a trait of mine, I was one of those people that never knew a stranger growing up. Never ever would I have thought this would get in the way of my sex life in a committed relationship, but, here we are.


Before my girlfriend, I knew very little about sex, I mostly had just learned through stories and I guess porn, although that‚Äôs a shitty teacher most of the time. Being with her i‚Äôve discovered there is an entire new world out there, and each and every person has their intricacies and desires and dislikes and fetishes when it comes to sex. It‚Äôs like the other half of life has been revealed to me, in many ways. New personalities to discover. 


And then I felt that desire start to come on, a realization. I wanted to have sex with other people not because I don‚Äôt love my girlfriend, but because i‚Äôm curious about other people. I want to experience the diversity in sex and the myriads of different people and how they do it. (Although I am  straight, I often wonder about what it would be like to be with a man because of that very curiosity) . 


So I‚Äôm at this really weird place, and it‚Äôs weighing very heavy on me mentally. I love being in a relationship with my girlfriend, no part of me wants it to end.

Sorry if this isn't the right place for this post, I am still new to Reddit,and this sub.

For background, I'm 21, M and have just started working. I have never had any real relationship and have no experience sexually. Or even in kissing, if I'm being honest. 

Before this, I was on a job hunt for ~5 months (irrelevant info for you but still). I was not in touch with a lot of people, going out socially etc. But since I have started working, it's like my desire to have sex has spiked through the roof. All I can think about when I have free time is to please a woman using my lips and fingers. A lot of my thoughts go towards eating a pussy, imagining what it must feel like to be able to make someone orgasm by just eating them out (I recently started watching lesbian porn, or porn that focuses on satisfaction of women rather than drilling them hard where that pleasure becomes painful/hurtful)

I partly think it's because of the environment outside my office, which is surrounded by caf√©s and redtaurants/shops, the places you go to chill. I go on walks after my meals so I do see couples a lot. Plus the women in my office,a lot of them seem so damn hot and sometimes I wonder what it would be like to eat them out. I then have to immediately change my thiughts, firstly because it's my workspace and it feels wrong to think about. I have almost never thought of women this way but suddenly, it's like I think about sex a lot. I don't know why.

I don‚Äôt understand women very much (or the theatre men and women put on with each other), I don‚Äôt want to have just sex, and my desire for sex just seems like a waste of brain space I could be investing into being a better Soldier, student, and entrepreneur. A distraction from being a better son, brother and uncle and a more just man. At this point my sexual urges seem like a weakness and I can‚Äôt wait for them to go away. Seeing how love + sex is a waste of effort...I just want to build businesses, help my family, train and and hunt bad guys üò© is that too much to ask for! Btw anyone have any tips or meds that reduce sexual urges? Thanks for reading üôÇüôÉ",1576966752.0
120,120,I've lost my will to live. I can't tell who I am anymore or where the lines between my sexual desire and mental desire stop. I need help. Please.,4,ehadjr,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/ehadjr/ive_lost_my_will_to_live_i_cant_tell_who_i_am/,3,"Personally I just want to be a normal dude. I just want a 9-5,  a wife, a kid or 2. Friends to go out with when I have the chance. Interests to spend pocket money on. A vanilla sex life.

Sexually I literally want to be a woman. I want to have the body of a woman, dress like a woman, act and sound like a woman. I want to be a fuck toy for other men. I want to be tied up, gagged, blindfolded. I want to have all my freedom taken away while they ravage all my holes. I want to be soaked in cum, surrounded by men. Demeaned, graffitied, and used. 

Ffs i even consider myself a switch and nothing gets me off harder than being a sissy.

I try to justify it. ""It's your sexual trauma"" ""It's your OCD"" ""It's your body dysmorphia"". But even if it was ik fetishes have no cure. I'm here now. I'll always be this way. I can't really be fully happy without it. 

I've even debated if I was trans or not. Maybe my dysmophia is dysphoria. Maybe the non sexual fantasies I've had of being a girl and dressing in girls clothes since as early as 4 is a sign. But I can't be cuz I'm scared of losing the life I have.

Don't get me wrong, I've had woman into me that I find extremely attractive and I've been extremely attracted to women but how the fuck am I supposed to have a relationship if I can't tell if I want to he with or if I want to BE my partner.

If presented with a button that allowed me to alter history and be born as a girl, I'd do it.

I can't even tell who I am anymore.

I have the fuck can I be a good father, a good husband, when I think I'd like to be a woman and know I'd like to be a sex slave.

I have normal interests. Normal friends. Normal hobbies.

He isn't great at verbalizing but he expresses it through his actions - opening my car door, helping me build things for my projects, always making sure I have enough blanket between my legs so my knees don't knock together while I sleep etc. He even started turning the heat up at his house when I come over because I mentioned that his house is always cold....fucking sweet as shit, right? He's so good to me which is why I feel so horribly guilty about bringing up a shortcoming - especially one he is probably going to hate addressing. I feel like I should just shut up and be thankful that this one isn't abusing me.

We have sex about once a week. I wish we had it more, but I struggle to get into the mood because he never compliments me, sexts with me, flirts or verbalizes his desire in any way. I've tried to initiate this type of play with him but either he isn't catching on (admittedly he does suck at humor/socializing sometimes) or he knows what I'm doing and is choosing to reject the opportunity - I'm not sure.

When we do have sex, it starts with him taking my hand and putting it on his dick - this is my cue to give him a blowjob at which point I can hop on for a ride if I want. He doesn't spend time kissing me, touching me or anything like that. This makes me feel like he cares about me as a person (which is why we are in a relationship) but that he only has sex with me because I'm the hole(s) available and he is too nice of a guy to cheat.

I wish we had more foreplay - flirting, innuendo, complimenting me, french kissing....any sort of expression of desire for me, really. Is this an acceptable need, or am I being unreasonable? I worry that if I bring this up with him that either a) I'll find out a hard truth that he doesn't really desire me or b) he will feel bad / uncomfortable and since he sucks at emotional stuff he won't be sure how to proceed so he'll just stop initiating entirely.

We've managed to have sex only three times, about 2 months ago and all 3 times didn't last long because it hurt for her or I lost my erection. We both have anxiety, AND we both have **performance anxiety** (losing erection for me, and vaginismus for her though both could be more complicated). I'm on Scialis to prevent losing my erection and she's on Xanax for anxiety. we still haven't had sex again.

We have fights regularly, it's become exhausting for both of us. I can't  meet her needs to feel desired and the inability of me to show this desire of mine is taking its toll on our relationship. It seems to be a feed-forward cycle at this point, we can't have sex because it's too tense because we fight because we can't have sex, etc.

I have Asperger's, and while this is not an excuse, it is difficult to show my emotions and I think this is a big part of it. Everything seems fake when I say or do something, mechanical almost. I've never been able to compliment her in a way that makes her feel sexy. I shy away from doing this because of the negative reaction but at this point it's causing our relationship to be constantly tense. I do feel lust towards my partner, especially when she's wearing something sexy and I see her ass or breasts more... or when she goes on a intellectual rant about something, or bending over to water the plants. Watching her dress knowing that she's trying to hide makes things even hotter. Seeing her her lips in the light makes me want to have them all over me etc.... All good healthy thoughts as part of a sexual relationship I think? but when the time comes, my words come out as  gobbledygook and it then stresses me out that I can't articulate it in a way to make her feel sexy (only probably making her feel uncomfortable). 

We are going for couples counselling and openly communicating, without trying to get heated in an argument (before anyone suggests this). We cuddle a lot and I don't feel uncomfortable with touch with her (with other people, hugs are still weird).

What I need are ways of complimenting her *verbally and in action* to translate my thoughts so she understands how much I want to fuck her, not just by saying it. Are there any suggestions for this?

TL,DR: I am useless at translating my thoughts into useful compliments to make my girlfriend feel desired and this is ruining our sex life. I'd love suggestions!",1576709013.0

i‚Äôm f19. i‚Äôm indian, although i‚Äôm very fair and definitely benefit from colourism (üò©), and i‚Äôve lived in britain my entire life. i‚Äôve had a very cultural upbringing in my home but apart from that i‚Äôm fully white-washed. 

i‚Äôm extremely left wing, i‚Äôm very empathetic, i care about all people, all animals, and i hope to do something humanitarian in the future. i‚Äôm particularly interested in poverty in the developing world. 

for some reason, ive always found white, dominant men extremely hot. ESPECIALLY if they‚Äôre right wing. i‚Äôm extremely submissive and i‚Äôm attracted, probably, to toxic masculine traits, such as lack of empathy and complete depravity, in sexual partners. i‚Äôve realised that this isn‚Äôt really sustainable for an actual relationship. 

when i was 18, i briefly dated this one guy who was white. he wasn‚Äôt racist in the slightest. i told him i wanted to engage in race play but he, doing the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing in my opinion, told me it made him uncomfortable and that he didn‚Äôt want to do that. i think that was the best thing. 

i‚Äôve tried to get past my desire for raceplay and accept it. it makes sense that if i‚Äôm extremely submissive, i‚Äôm bound to be attracted to white men even if it goes against all my views outside the bedroom. so i‚Äôve told myself it‚Äôs okay if i want to take part with raceplay, ONLY if it‚Äôs with a guy who ISN‚ÄôT actually racist. 

recently, online, i‚Äôve been talking to this one guy for nearly a week. sexually, we jive really well. but a couple days ago, i found out that... he was genuinely a white supremacist. he believes white people are superior, genuinely believes black people are biologically determined to be criminals, that asians are biologically determined to be criminals, etc. and he feels no empathy apart from towards people he personally knows. 

his views disgust me, obviously. but i guess, with the sub/dom power dynamic there already is, he‚Äôs just trying to woo me and suggest i should be considerate towards his views. and just because we have different views doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt talk. and he said that he knows this turns me on. he hasn‚Äôt said anything racially insulting describing me (e.g. he hasn‚Äôt personally called me anything racist) and he claims to not hate non-white people. but he thinks that white people are superior and that each race should stick with its own kind. his views are really disgusting, i know. 

i‚Äôm not sure what to do. i‚Äôm really attracted to him, and i hate myself for it. but i feel this connection towards him and he said he feels a connection towards me too. even though i guess he‚Äôs just saying that because he doesn‚Äôt get a lot of attention. meanwhile, me being a woman, it‚Äôs not that difficult to get attention on the internet. but for some reason... i still want him? 

i‚Äôm really not sure what to do. üò© i feel like this is really a case of opposites attract. either that, or he‚Äôs just using the dom power dynamic to woo me into jeopardising my moral compass for him. üò© any advice would greatly be appreciated. thank you so much üò©.",1589228476.0

Frankly, as a woman, I feel like we go through so much already. The idea is concubine-ish in the sense that our society promotes MFF to an extensive degree. Lesbianism is a sexuality. Not for your entertainment. I honestly feel very disappointed and hurt when the guy I‚Äôm dating is so wonderful and then one day he asks for a threesome or anal. 

I‚Äôve discussed this with my friends and they agree. It hurts them too that their boyfriends would ask for such a thing. It makes us feel like we‚Äôre not enough down there, and I always see the man a bit differently after he asks. I feel sad. We want to feel enough for you down there, and we want to be the only ones that you want to a point where thinking of another woman ruining what we have is so far down the drain that you wouldn‚Äôt even risk asking unless we do. 

Anal is often painful or simply tolerable for many women, and unless a woman suggests it first, I feel like men shouldn‚Äôt push for it. It‚Äôs my body.

For her, it‚Äôs that she sometimes feels as though I demand too much of her sexually, whereas I am sometimes left with a feeling of dissatisfaction or frustration because she is not as willing to please the other as I am. Oft-times I will finish before her, so I do my best to help her get off too (fingering/tongue/etc.), something that I feel is not really the case the other way around. She explained that she never really was into the sex she had with previous (and/or current) partners; that they expected her to please them while she wasn‚Äôt too keen on it.

Moreover, sometimes in the middle of sex, she‚Äôll call it off because she‚Äôs gotten sore. This may happen five minutes in. It‚Äôs not that I was jack-hammering her or that I have a member as large as my arm, but she still thinks it‚Äôs normal and not something worth seeing a doctor about. If that‚Äôs so, how the heck do people go at it all night long without issue?? My female anatomical knowledge is pretty much Schei√üe, so I can‚Äôt be sure, but I really do think it‚Äôs worth mentioning to her gyno. I don‚Äôt understand why she isn‚Äôt as worried as I am.

She says she‚Äôs scared that I might leave her for someone who‚Äôs willing and/or able to do what she can‚Äôt (whether it's because she just *can‚Äôt* or because she doesn‚Äôt want to, I have no idea).

We've been together a few years now and started having sex soon after we met. 

She always complains of pain when having penetrative sex, even when I try to finger inside of her during foreplay, she doesn't like it. She only seems to enjoy me rubbing her clit with my finger. Often she will come to what i THINK is an orgasm? But whenever she begins to get this 'feeling' she forces me to stop, despite my occasional encouragement (never forceful, I always respectful). She never describes it as something that she particularly likes/craves but it's the only thing that doesn't cause discomfort. I've asked if she enjoys it, and she just says ""its okay"".

She never initiates, and says she feels pressured often to have sex. As a very sexual person who loves sexual intimacy this is very frustrating and often causes friction in our relationship. I've never felt desired by her, she doesn't even seem to enjoy kissing. However, she always tells me she likes/prefers to cuddle. When asked she does say I'm attractive.

Often she complains of pain when we try to have penetrative sex, to the point of crying out of frustration/pain when we try. We never really needed lube, as that was never the problem. But in an attempt to make it even easier, I introduced it a few months ago but it hasn't made any difference.

Once my penis is fully inside of her and we 'get going' the pain seems to go away but she says she feels absolutely nothing and seems very bored and I feel pressure just to get it over with and cum so that it's 'done' so to say. She says she doesn't know what to do so I'm always trying new positions and moving her about in order to do these, but she has no enthusiasm and will lay there not really doing/saying anything.

I wonder if I could have been doing something wrong? I always try to be really respectful, she knows that if she asks me to stop or do something differently I will immediately do so.

I've asked if we could watch porn together (she's never watched any) to maybe get ideas/inspiration/create desire but she says she hates the idea.

I tell her how beautiful she is all the time, she knows she's loved very much and I make it known when I think she looks great/hot. I don't think she really has any significant body issues. When I say more intimate things like 'your ass looks amazing, I'd love to be inside you right now' she sort of groans and theres almost never any reciprocation in these comments, especially spontaneously or when I haven't mentioned anything to her.

In the beginning I tried to be experimental/fun, trying new positions and stuff, but she was always reluctant and didn't like anything and so we've just reverted to vanilla missionary etc.. just to the point where I cum and it's over with. I try oral on her, doggie she hates, I don't have the confidence to introduce more 'kinky' stuff like dressing up, domination etc. I've asked many times about sex toys and she doesn't like the idea. She doesn't like the 'taste' of blowjobs, though she does give them sometimes when I ask, but won't let me cum in her mouth.  

I've had several sexual partners (never virgins) before, and we've always had great sex lives, enjoyable for us both. Always desire on both parts and satisfaction. I am slightly larger than normal so the only problem I've had before was that doing doggy was usually uncomfortable for the girl when I go deep, but that's pretty much it. I've always received great reactions when I finger inside girls, and felt like I had a great technique with it (which I haven't used in this relationship because when I try it causes pain/no enjoyment whatsoever).

I just don't know what to do at this point, other than our sex life we have a great relationship. But I don't know if I can allow it to be like this for the rest of our lives.. We're going away for a week or so together soon on a relaxing retreat so I was thinking of recommending we both read a helpful book on the subject that somehow gives us new ideas/suggestions. I want to make it an enjoyable experience for her, that we can share together.

She is not much of porn watcher when we are not together but I travel sometimes for work so it is a necessity for her time to time. 

We have an iPad that just sits around the house that is basically communal use for us, and since we don‚Äôt we have kids it‚Äôs not something that has to have the history cleansed. One Sunday morning after I had been out of town a couple of days I woke up before my wife and was in the living room drinking coffee pilfering through news and whatnot and I open up the browser to search for something. What I was searching for started with the letter P so when I started typing porn came up in the history from a couple of days before. Not only was it the porn site but it was three or four different videos she had watched. 

Some backstory. As long as I have known my wife she has always had a very nice posterior and I was converted from a boob man to an ass man and such have been interested in backdoor activities. When we first started dating we were dumb kids with no experience and we tried anal with no knowledge of what we were doing and long story short she shed a couple of tears when it was over. Ever since then I have still been interested but have never pushed because I felt bad about what happened in our prior experience. Over the next 14 years we have delved into it but haven‚Äôt gone all the way. Lately she has been seemed to like increasing the activity that we do back there but I‚Äôve always felt like it was because she thought I enjoyed it and thus I‚Äôve remained a little hesitant out of fear that it might hurt her or she might not really enjoy it. 

So, when I see her history it is like a gateway to what she desires without her having to tell me. And what I came to find out is that she really seems to be into backdoor play and what she searched was delightfully surprising and naughty to me. What made me feel the best was that it was quite specific and that involved me indirectly. It was things like ‚ÄúHusband licks wife‚Äôs ass‚Äù and ‚Äúhusband plugs wife‚Äôs ass and fucks her doggy style‚Äù. It made me feel good that she was specifying husband. I don‚Äôt expect my wife to think about me when she masturbates, but the fact that she seemed to made me feel really good. 

When she woke up that morning I asked her if she wanted to have sex and do a little booty play. She agreed and showered and did the normal prep for when she knows the upcoming activities. Let me tell you, with the confidence of knowing what she desired the next couple of days of sex was the peak of our 14 years. 

Since then I have traveled a couple of more times for work and each time upon getting back, to my delight, this situation has repeated itself with the search history. I kind of feel like I am invading her privacy, but at the same time I feel like it‚Äôs a way for her to tell me what she wants sexually without having to say the words. Our sex is at its peak, but I kind of feel like I‚Äôm using a cheat code on a video game to get it. If I told her I think she would be a little embarrassed, but I don‚Äôt think she would be mad. As long as it works I think I‚Äôm going to keep checking it out, but if anyone thinks I‚Äôm invading her privacy I would like to hear their opinion.",1589536508.0

We've enjoyed a very good sexual relationship, and we manage the mechanics of sex very successfully.

However, I  feel as if I've stalled in terms of understanding her psychological triggers, and developing my ability to seduce, and my ""sexual persona"".

There's obviously psychological breaks such as feelings of pressure, guilt, stress, and rough patches in a relationship. I'm aware of this, and I try to communicate as best as I can that there's no room for guilt or pressure, and that in times where that influences her sex drive, I'm completely fine with backing off.

So a part of our dynamic is that when sex is back on the table, she initiates again to let me know we're back on. I also want her to initiate oral sex with me, and I find that that fits with my idea of a dominant-submissive relationship, where I am the dominant one.

I do experience that when sex is on the table, we kinda both know it's on the table, and we give each other these small hints, that eventually leads to me taking control, and us having sex.

But I don't feel that I can reliably seduce her. She's either in the mood, and it happens, or she's not, and my attempts fail. This is perfectly fine of course, but I think we would both benefit if I got better at this. She would be more aroused, and probably be aroused by the fact that I was a competent seducer, and I would feel empowered by this, and we'd have this positive feedback loop going.

Her ability to get aroused is obviously a product of her daily stress levels, and other environmental factors, hormones, and how good we're doing in our relationship at any given time.

I've asked her about these kinds of things before, and I do know what fantasies she has, and what generally turns her on, but the information is not really actionable.

I guess I would like to know if anyone else are thinking about ""developing a sexual persona"", or enjoys someones ""sexual persona"", or am I imagining a concept that doesn't exist?

Are there things that you've implemented, or asked your partner about, that has led to success?

Are there behaviours or characteristics that reliably seduces you?

I imagine this to be the least artificial form of role play. Just as someone submissive would act a certain way, or get a certain look, or speak in a different tone, and offer themselves in a certain way, you remain yourself but you have this other mode.

I've been thinking about this a lot, and would love some insights!",1590136332.0

We're a great team, we have the same long term goals, I love him and I love our life together. The difficulty is sex, and problem has shifted slowly over time. Please help.

We have been together for five years. When we first started dating, we were fucking multiple times a day. I was getting involved in the sex-positive scene and he was supportive. Physical touch is my love language and he got the same result when he took the test. We have always been very physically expressive, sit next to each other for every meal, cuddle while we watch TV, and I fall asleep on his chest every night (when he's home- more on that later). The sex was plentiful and present, and I loved it. Of course, things slowed down as they often do, but it was because he was working on a crazy project or tired and stressed out. Even if the quantity dropped, the quality has always been really good.

When the frequent rejection started, I was understanding. After a while, I was very hurt. I took it personally. While he rejects my advances, he has always taken the time to assure me he loves me, finds me super sexy, and promises that we will get frisky soon, when he is less tired. I looked internally, realized a lot of that pain I was feeling was because I was attaching SO MUCH to that rejection. When he said no to sex, I felt like he was saying no to me and to our relationship. I have processed this idea intensely over the years, and have finally mentally separated those thoughts. I keep myself physically satisfied by getting myself off when he isn't home. I keep myself mentally satisfied by asking him for extra non-sexual physical affection when we are together, or by connecting platonically over the phone when we're apart.

He has changed from a mentally taxing job to a physically taxing job. He now travels for almost half the year. I went from short and fun jobs to long and slow ones. We just spent an intense year planning and executing a huge wedding, and we're in the midst of buying a house. I feel like we went from carefree 20-somethings, going to festivals, traveling, taking short work projects when we wanted to, and taking time off when we wanted to... to now both of us working full-time, committed to these huge expenses, with almost no breaks. Not even weekends.

And I'm completely devoid of interest in sex.

Sex and sex ed and trying new things in the bedroom used to be so interesting to me, like an actual hobby of mine. I loved opening up to him and being vulnerable and connecting. Now the idea of sex stresses me out. Work is making me stress-eat. I'm gaining weight. I don't like him to see me naked. I don't believe it when he says he finds me sexy. I don't believe him when he promises to have sex later. I don't initiate. I avoid his (very rare) initiation.

There was a short period of time where he would initiate once a week, while we were in the shower. Okay, that's fun and all, but I can't get off in the shower. So it was like three weeks of once a week shower sex and that was it. I eventually put a stop to it, and told him YES it's like a fun side-dish quickie, but I need MORE than that to survive on. And while that's true, I just feel my body shutting down, like I would rather hide under a blanket alone than have any sex at all these days.

Thank you to anyone who read this. I have been swamped at work lately, which has diverted all my focus away from the issue, but now that I have free time all of a sudden, my depression is hitting me like a ton of bricks.

**TL;DR- Husband too tired for sex. He's been too tired like 90% of our entire relationship. We took on more adult responsibilities. I stopped initiating. I gained weight. Now I hate even the idea of sex. Even thinking about it makes me anxious. How do I get back to normal?**",1571632211.0

Here's the thing...I'm super insecure about my attractiveness and his desire to stay with me for a few reasons. He has asked me multiple times in the last year for an open relationship, and very recently told that he fantasizes frequently about women that he sees and knows IRL, not just to porn (and the porn I am fine with). Has a history of leading women on by flirting and encouraging any sexual energy that might be present, and ends up getting their numbers, etc. Swears he has never had sex with anyone else, but went to a strip club and got a lap dance and has paid for a happy ending massage both while I was out of town. He planned to never tell me about those, but I told him during a fight that if anything ever came out later that he had lied to me about I would divorce him no question.

A not insignificant portion of that has to do with her total lack of desire in sex. We have been together since we were 17. Up until a year or so ago, we would have sex 2-4 times a week, and she would orgasm during sexual activity usually about 3 times or so. I‚Äôm no sex god, but we‚Äôve been together since we were teenagers and I know how to get her off both manually and piv and we aren‚Äôt (weren‚Äôt) shy about using toys. She is a great sex partner to me as well. 

Her sex drive has become utterly nonexistent, especially nosediving since our second kid. She says she just doesn‚Äôt want it, and has absolutely no interest. She tells me she is willing to let me ‚Äúuse her body‚Äù whenever I want. The thing is, I immensely enjoy when she orgasms. It‚Äôs fulfilling to me. But at the same time, I enjoy the way she feels and want to respect her ‚Äúdesire‚Äù not to orgasm. There is also something arousing about ‚Äúusing‚Äù her body for pleasure, though obviously I don‚Äôt want that to be the norm and miss her orgasming with me. 

I‚Äôve tried talking to her about it in every way possible. I‚Äôve asked a million different ways what I can do to unlock her desire once again. She says it‚Äôs just not going to happen, and I need to accept that or leave her. 

I feel horrible for somewhat even entertaining the idea that this is a reasonable compromise. We are best friends, have two beautiful children, fulfilling careers, similar interests, a wonderful home, etc. etc. etc. etc. if it‚Äôs this or divorce, am I wrong to be considering this? 

Last night, after no sex for weeks, I finally told her I can‚Äôt live in a sexless marriage. She told me I don‚Äôt have to, that she is willing to let me ‚Äúuse‚Äù her. I agreed in the moment (in part to see how she would react as I was at my rope‚Äôs end) and she literally proceeded to put on something sexy, start stroking me with enthusiasm and made me orgasm within minutes And she seemed happy about it. She washed off and we proceeded to giggle and talk/read in bed for a while afterwards. But I also feel guilty because I am (was) so used to a sexual relationship where there is mutual gratification. 

Is this an acceptable situation? Have others done something similar? Am I a terrible person for considering it?",1587939146.0

Thank you for reading.

TLDR: I help asexual gf with major project and she wants to reward me with a BJ. I remind her BJ's in the past have gone badly and we fight. Now, I'm thinking about giving up on sex altogether because a little sex is worse than no sex at all. 

To preface, I've been with my girlfriend for 5 years (both mid-20's) with plenty of ups and downs, sex being one of the most conflicted part of it. We were each others' firsts, and she has always had very little interest in sex. We had sex occasionally, my sex drive is waaaay higher than hers (she calls me addicted) but I am content, and she enjoys it after we get started, but condoms took away most of the pleasure from sex for her. A couple years ago she got an IUD and she truly enjoyed the freedom and feeling of having raw sex for a short while. 

About 3 years ago, my gf came out as asexual, she still loves me romantically, but sex was just not her thing. This expanded to her 'not caring' about much of what we do. Some examples: she doesn't feel the need to hold hands or general PDA but 'doesn't care' if I take her hand or want a quick peck before leaving for work. Most of the time she 'doesn't care' if we do kiss more seriously or I want to have sex, and says that she does it to make me happy when I have a bad day or am really stressed. This doesn't apply when she wants to cuddle or nap/sleep together. Recently (past several months before lock down), she disliked me touching her too much (in general) and was very short with PDA even in private. \[I mean PDA as hugging, consensual groping, medium kissing, things of that nature that aren't too sexual\] 

The incident that sparked this internal debate happened a couple days ago. My gf was hard stuck with one of her projects, and with both of us working in a similar field, I helped her out with planning and refining the project. It took a fairly long time and I made an offhand comment about wanting a blowjob token for helping me out. I admit, this was my mistake. 

Background: she very much does not like giving bjs. Her reasons: she has TMJ, they take a lot of energy, she gets bored, it only gives me pleasure, semen is disgusting, I take too long to cum, ect. I am not contesting her reasons in the slightest, how she feels is completely valid, but they have happened for various reasons, my birthday, her rewarding me, sometimes she just wanted to, and we don't have a great track record of them going well because of those reasons surfacing after the initial excitement fades.

I'm not sure if it was the exhaustion or the gratification of her project moving forward, she was suddenly unusually enthusiastic about wanting to reward me and telling me that I'm not selfish enough and how badly she wanted to suck me off. I was noncommittal and tried to brush the issue aside but she determined a date for it and said I would get if whether I wanted it or not. I let her be to hopefully calm down for the past couple days, and now before dinner I tried to bring up how bjs don't typically go well with us. That was as far as I got, I tried to directly address the issue but not be too confrontational and she was pissed at me, saying ""I'm not selfish enough,"" ""I never ask for anything or treat myself,"" so ""why am I stopping her from rewarding me for helping her."" I responded that I know I'm an asshole and a coward for not wanting to take the risk that things could go badly. Conveniently, the dog needed to go potty during the argument and that deflated the tension, I then left to pick up the food and we've been avoiding the issue since. 

In the end, I'm starting to believe that, for us, sex causes far too much trouble. She doesn't have an interest in sex and I am content going without. We both love being close to one another and napping together is now our favorite thing to do together. Before, I felt a crushing weight on my chest whenever I thought about giving up sex forever but now I don't feel that bad about it anymore. 

We do both go to therapists already and do discuss sex together and about its frequency decreasing but have not discussed foregoing it altogether yet.",1588786204.0

(I would post this in r/deadbedrooms but I find the advice for young people is overwhelmingly ""get out!"" and that's not where I am right now.)

1) Context

I have been living with my boyfriend for 2 months. We have been together a year and a half. At the start of our relationship, we had really strong sexual energy. We didn't jump right into sex, and built a good foundation. I was very impressed and satisfied with our sex, and he was always passionate and put SO much care and effort into my pleasure, as I did for him in return. We had sex often. Now, we haven't had any sexual contact for 3 months, and we have had barely any chemistry and very rare sex for the past 6 months total.

2) Our Past - Possible Causes

We both went through periods of really bad mental health in months 4-6 of our relationship where we did not treat ourselves or eachother kindly. In this time, my boyfriend developed an insecurity about his penis size (which you wouldn't expect him to be insecure about) and whether he was my ""ideal type."" He had come across some old texts from before we were together between my friend and I in which I described being very attracted to a type of guy that does not look like him, as well as texts where my friends and I idealised really large penis size. 
We of course have worked through this period of time: We have trust and would never look at eachothers' texts now. I don't speak to my friends in shallow manners about size anymore (especially since it didn't even reflect my preferences but was just how I was used to people talking). We have had numerous conversations about how I am attracted to all different people for different reasons, and I am especially attracted to him. We both have our general confidence and mental health back. 

This is relevant though because during during that time we were still having sex, and our sex actually got physically better during that hard time. My boyfriend confessed to me, however, that there were times that he imagined to be a different guy when he was fucking me to try and have enough confidence to stay hard etc. He once even imagined to be my ex - someone who did not treat me well or listen to me sexually. After this period of time, our relationship started to heal, and we had amazing, kinky sex for maybe a month or two before it started dropping off.

My boyfriend was having serious issues with his energy levels, and seeked help from a doctor who sent him to a psychiatrist who ""doesn't believe in talk therapy"" and just put him on an antidepressant. Now, the sexual energy and the sex started dying before the antidepressants, and they didn't seem to make it worse really. He has since come off the antidepressants after taking them for a few months, and our situation has only gotten worse.

3) Current Situation

At this point, we have lived together 2 months. We have not had any sexual contact, not even sexual kissing, for almost 3 months. We have had little chemistry and very rare, less passionate sex for 6 months now. My boyfriend and I try to keep communication open about the issue. I tell him that I'm not upset or hurt that he's not having sex with me, but rather because he doesn't seem to be putting any effort into fixing whatever is at the root of this. He still masturbates, and often. He has lied to me about that recently, telling me he had stopped when he hadn't. He thinks his low libido is due to masturbation addiction, and although I am listening to his own judgement of himself, I still wonder if masturbation could cause this significant of a libido drop. He masturbates every 1-3 days from what I gather.

I feel sad and lonely and hurt almost every night, but I keep this down most nights. I bring it up when the thoughts get unbearable, but he's heard my side so many times. I don't want to give up hope of a sexual experience with him happening soon because I want to try and foster what is left of our chemistry, but it just causes me pain every single time I think about how sexy he is or when I fantasize about him. I'm afraid if I suppress these thoughts then the situation will only get worse, but right now it's really painful. I am a very sexual person, and I crave sexual chemistry with my partner.

4) Help!

I'm posting here because I don't know how to be supportive of him and also look out for my needs. I am very anxious to initiate anything at all because my ex was very forceful with sex with me when I didn't want it, and I never ever want to make someone feel that way. Am I hurting the situation by not trying to initiate? I have told him that anytime he is ready, even for just a blowjob or making out, I am here and ready, but that I don't want to initiate for fear of being pushy. So he is aware that I want him, but maybe I do need to show it in my actions more to help him foster sexual thoughts? He says he often masturbates to me and is very attracted to me.

I really need help. I don't believe this is a low vs high libido in a relationship issue. I think it is temporary, but I don't know what I can do to help. There are just so many factors. Any insight or advice would be very much appreciated.

Tl;dr: My boyfriend has had very low libido for the past 6mo, and I have a very high libido. I think this is a temporary low libido since it used to be high and was high in past relationships. May be medical and psychological factors contributing. He thinks it is because of a masturbation addiction. I don't know how to try and reignite our sex life without hurting myself or disrespecting his needs and boundaries.",1574256647.0

As a younger person I used to crave sex as sort of an affirmation of my worth and self esteem. I've been working on developing my own independent life in a lot of ways and spend a lot of time apart from my husband doing my own thing. Sex is different though. Nowadays, when I try to initiate sex, I see that shy scared little girl from before, trying to offer herself on a plate timidly, testing the waters to see if he's interested. I don't like myself like this. So now I don't initiate much, and we dont have a lot of sex.

He has a generally lower libido than me so I don't like the idea of being too aggressive or outwardly sexual. But hinting and playing dumb doesn't often get the message across either. A couple of times I've yelled 'hey, do you want to have sex?' from the other room to be casual and it catches him off guard. When he says no, I shrug it off like it doesn't matter. And it shouldn't. I want to retain my dignity and independence, but i would like to know how to balance that with a healthy sex life.",1587375591.0

157,157,"What is Michael Bader smoking? ""Any parent who has watched a son or daughter come of age is aware of how powerful these feelings of attraction can be and to what lengths both parties go to avoid this embarrassing tension.""",10,gb74ij,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/gb74ij/what_is_michael_bader_smoking_any_parent_who_has/,12,"This is gonna be a bit of an icky topic, but it's a question I have to ask. It uh, relates to parent-child incest and pedophilia, so.

**I'm honestly not sure where to post this, so if it's not suitable for this subreddit please direct me to somewhere it would be.**

So basically, I've been doing some reading, specifically Michael Bader's book ""Male Sexuality"" which tries to take a psychoanalytical lens to the topic. I was mostly nodding along and finding it interesting until it got into talking about pedophilia at some point, and societal attitudes toward it.

The part that struck me was this:
""Most experts‚Äîand many parents‚Äîwould agree that children are sexual  beings, that  they  have  the  capacity  for  sexual  pleasure  even  if they don‚Äôt always understand how to regulate it. And there is equally no doubt that adults sometimes have sexual feelings for children. **Any parent who has watched a son or daughter come of age is aware of how powerful these feelings of attraction can be and to what lengths both parties go to avoid this embarrassing tension.**""

Taken out of context, it might look like he's trying to be a pedophilia apologist or something, but that isn't actually quite the direction he takes. Still, something really bothers me about this, and let me break it down:

So, children having some limited degree of sexual capacity, I can get. I remember my own curiosity and discovery as a child, underdeveloped as it obviously was. I also get that ""adults sometimes have sexual feelings for children"" because pedophiles obviously exist.

But it's that *last* part that really threw me for a loop. ""*Any* parent who has watched a son or daughter come of age""? Is he really trying to say that parents having sexual feelings for their adolescent offspring as they sexually mature is *commonplace?* I am going to have to give that a big *citation needed*.

Disclaimer: I am not a parent, much less of a sexually mature teenager, so I can't fully relate to that position. But this just doesn't seem *correct*. I can see it being the case in step-parents who adopt an older child, since they don't have the blood bond or the context of having raised them since they were in diapers, and thus the instinctive ""Westermarck effect"" or what have you doesn't kick in against sexual attraction. I don't even entirely rule it out of biological parents. We *do* have a subgroup of parents that molest their teenage children, who might exist within another subgroup of parents plagued by such desires but who never act on them and likely don't talk about them. But that being a majority? That being ""*any parent*""? I'm just finding that to be a *hard sell*. Yet this is apparently coming from a psychotherapist with 30 years of clinical experience working with people's sexual problems.

What I'm looking for is second opinions, whether that be from parents who would have first-hand experience with which to comment on this, or anyone else. It just feels like I've entered the Twilight Zone here. I came into this book entirely unprepared for such a *glaringly bold claim* which is then glossed over as other topics are discussed. Why have I never heard about this? What planet is the author living on? Why didn't the Amazon reviews mention this? I don't understand!",1588318829.0

Being young and innocent, I thought I'd never want that either. So I agreed. 

Now that I'm a bit older and have explored my sexuality much further, I find the idea of a MFM threesome very fucking hot. It doesn't even have to be a threesome. Even just bringing another man into the bedroom, with my husband there watching and even joining in or reclaiming me afterward. To clarify, my husband is very well endowed. He satisfies me almost every time we have sex, he is very focused on my wants and needs. I love him deeply, and I have absolutely NO thoughts of cheating on him. 

I have been open about previous desires I've had, but they were small things.. use a butt plug on me while we fuck, DP me with your cock and toys, let me stick the tip of my finger in your ass.. And he's always been willing to try everything at least once. Some of them he likes, some he doesn't. I just have a weird feeling about how he'd react to me asking for basically cuckolding. I've considered just keeping it to myself, but I think about it often enough now that I have dreams about it. How should I approach him about this? 

TL;DR - I want to be a hotwife for my husband, whether he joins in on the action or not, even though he told me years ago he never wants to share me.


Edit - Thank you to those who bring forward genuine advice. I suppose I could have worded my entire post differently. To answer some common questions and accusations: 

- Yes, I'm open to the idea of FMF.
- Yes, I am very satisfied with having only my husband for the rest of my life. 
- No, I would never cheat on him.
- No, I do not want you in my inbox asking to be the one. Cut that shit out.",1589074155.0

I am slightly nervous to post this in such a pro-sex sub, but hear me out. I (27F) recently got out of a 3 year relationship in which my partner (30m) and I had mismatched libidos (mine very low, his very high). He constantly expressed his desperate need for sex, which pushed me away even further because I felt that he didn‚Äôt value me as a person or partner, but as an object for sex. I felt as though he was constantly pawing at me, which made me withdraw from any physical touch at all. 

Long story short, an old sexual partner of his ended up contacting him out of the blue for sex after she ended things with her bf. My ex basically told me that either I had to allow him to have sex with her or he was leaving. I told him to go ahead and leave. His decision to abandon our relationship to go have sex with some random FWB absolutely killed me. 

Now, I am repulsed by men‚Äôs sexual desire. My ex‚Äôs hornyness destroyed our relationship and he left me (and our otherwise very good relationship) to go have sex with someone he doesn‚Äôt even like. I have been having trouble reconciling all of this and it has left me feeling very worried about my sexual relationships in the future.

The other issue is that I constantly see men posting on reddit sexualizing and degrading women. I see posts of women minding their own business, doing something fun or cool, and the comments are all about her boobs or ass, comments on her physical appearance or sex appeal. It disgusts me. No matter what we do, we can always be reduced to a sex object with a single remark. 

I know people will suggest therapy, and I agree with that. When I‚Äôm able, I will be going back to my regular therapist.

So this is how our conversation went; I suddenly remembered a post about they had their wedding with only close friends and relatives and I wanted to share this to him. I opened up with ‚ÄúHey, if we‚Äôre gonna end up with each other, in our marriage...‚Äù and then he says that I should not plan about marriage and just see what happens. I then said that, oh okay but let me just share this thing I saw where they had a marriage with only close ones, etc. And he didn‚Äôt reply the whole time I shared this and then at the end I said if you do pick me in the future, I want to be a fianc√©e for a long time because I like the name. And then he just replied ‚Äú:D‚Äù and then brought up another topic. I sensed he was kinda off so I asked him ‚ÄúDo you want me to refrain from bringing up marriage? Because we should just see how our relationship goes? And I should just talk about it if the time comes? I won‚Äôt talk if you don‚Äôt want.‚Äù And then he replies ‚ÄúI agree.‚Äù and then we moved on to another topic ‚Äòcause I didn‚Äôt want to be pushy but honestly, this really worried me.

Thing is, before this, we talked about our future home. He had no problem talking about it. Especially about having a ‚Äúplay room‚Äù. He even said he wanted it to be a hidden room like behind a closet. We are very open, as you can see, we talk about a lot of things and we‚Äôre basically best friends. We have sex a lot too, so I was kinda worried why he rejects when I start talking about marriage? We‚Äôre basically upfront to each other and I have no doubts about our relationship, but why doesn‚Äôt he like thinking about marriage? I know we‚Äôre too young to worry about it, and I‚Äôm not worrying about it. I‚Äôm just concerned that he doesn‚Äôt like bringing it up? Like does he not imagine marrying me? But why can he easily talk about having a play room with me in the future? We‚Äôve been through a lot in our relationship too, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm kinda anxious always in our relationship.

Recently, she commented that she wishes she was one of those girls that was in the mood for sex alot more. The context of the comment is that she believes I have a higher libido. I don't believe I have a higher libido. She just really does it for me and I tell her this. In fact, she may flirt or bring up sex more often than I do. I think our libidos are matched up pretty well, all things considered.

I've heard similar comments from other women, friends and previous partners, about females out there that are DTF whenever, but I've never known one specifically. Women that I've known well all tend to be fairly similar, in that sex for them within the boundaries of a serious relationship is complicated and interdependent on several factors. She tells me she's this way too.

I believe her but I can't relate. Sex for me is simple. When I'm with her, I wanna have sex, especially when I see her her the first time that day, whether it be first thing in the morning or after a long day of work. I want to ride that wave of closeness I get from sex for the rest of the day. Even better is when I can carry it with me when I know I'm not going to see her for a day or two. 

When our moods match up, it's absolute fireworks. But when they don't match up, it's a mess. We both feel guilty for how we're wired and we end up further away from each other.

I guess I'm wondering if these hypothetical women exist that are DTF whenever. I'm not asking because I want to be with someone else. I'm curious if she's holding herself up to an impossible standard",1586891999.0
181,181,I (26F) am not sure whether I lost my libido or am asexual,3,gpdovn,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/gpdovn/i_26f_am_not_sure_whether_i_lost_my_libido_or_am/,3," 

So, this has been the bane of my existence as a young adult. I apologize in advance if some of the my post is NSFW or TMI, but I felt I needed to get into the specifics because I really need advice. :(

I am extremely confused about my sexuality because even though I used to experience sexual attraction/horniness, it has been gone ever since I was 20 more or less. My complete lack of interest in sex makes me feel really unsure about my sexual identity at an age where I think I should have figured it out. Also, I had my hormone levels checked and they are fine.

I have had two relationships in my life - my first one started when I was 16 and ended when I was 22. Sex was never great, or easy, but at least for the first 3 years I used to have fantasies, masturbate, and experience arousal and orgasm. The whole 9 yards.  
Unfortunately sex was always an issue between my ex and me because it was never ""easy"" - intercourse did not do much for me but I enjoyed foreplay, but since neither of us ever really received proper sex education, we were both operating under the assumption that penises are magic wands that are supposed to make women orgasm automatically.

This made both of us feel inadequate, me because I had to be faulty, him because he was clearly not enough of a man (despite being the kind of guy who would cry watching Wreck It Ralph, he had internalised toxic masculinity in this regard). It caused us both a lot of pain - contributing to my pre-existing anxiety and making me enter a vicious circle - and became an outstanding issue in our relationship, causing a rift that ultimately led to its end.

My attraction to him was completely lost towards the half of the relationship. At the start I thought this was because of how tense sex had become - me not orgasming would make us both miserable.  
We still kept on having sex, rarely, but we sorta just went through the motions and it wasn't enjoyable for either. He had also stopped putting an effort in his appearance, which I thought contributed as well.  
Plus, I was going through some major stress (unemployment is a serious issue in my country and I was depressed and having suicidal intrusive thoughts because I was afraid I would have to move back in with my overbearing parents in my shitty hometown after university).

Finally, we broke up for good. I moved abroad, started a new job, and I figured these issues would solve themselves once I met someone else.. but...

I have been dating a very good guy for 2 1/2 years, but my libido has not come back. We have a very healthy relationship, he is a very leveled and balanced ~~alien~~ person who has never experienced self-doubt or insecurity in his life, which means that he does not take this personally. As of now, I have only experienced arousal ONCE 6 months in - we were on the couch and he started playing with my nipples, feeling actual arousal after years stunned me, I felt like he had accidentally used the Konami code or something. That lasted 5 minutes (I was SO overwhelmed by surprise I ended up not acting on it. lol)

At the start we had sex pretty regularly once a week or so, I was hoping my libido would come back, but it didn't and having sex without being aroused started wearing me down more and more, like having my nipples touched makes me feel like they are about to turn inwards and retreat like a turtle's head.

I was transparent from the start regarding the situation, and after talking to him again about how little I enjoyed sex he told me that he would not mind having sex very rarely or even having a completely sexless relationship (in 2020 we had sex like 4 times, last time 2mo ago, and I personally have no desire to do it again). According to him, he can take care of the urge himself, he has two dealbreakers - that there is still intimacy between the two of us and that I either come to terms with what I am right now or take concrete steps towards changing it. Basically, either accepting I am asexual or, if I am not fine with that, investigating my lack of libido, because he can't bear to see me beating myself up over this.

So... the fact that I have an accepting partner is technically great news, but I still have so many questions I cannot answer... sometimes I wonder if I like girls, because I do find women more attractive, but I have never been with one and tbh the thought of actually doing it does not spark any interest as of now.  
Did I ever like guys or is it just what I was conditioned to accept because of our heteronormative standards? How is it possible that I was sexual in my earlier years and lost my libido? Is this a result of trauma or mental illness? And if that is the case, does it mean I should fight to get it back, can I really come to terms with my current asexuality given in my case it might not be ""real""? Am I ever going to find love if my current relationship does not work out? How did he manage to turn me on that time and why did it never happen again? Should I be happy that I found someone so accepting or should I maybe consider that I might feel arousal with someone else?

TL;DR: I used to be sexual until my 20s but then my libido disappeared completely after bad experiences + depression and never came back despite me leaving my relationship and my mental health improving dramatically. Currently unsure whether I should accept myself as I am or embark on a quest to regain it.",1590300406.0

Some times while we are kissing and doing some foreplay i'll ask her what she wants me to do to her or what makes her feel the best but she usually gives me an ""idk what ever you want to do"" type answer which doesn't give me anything to go on. I know she likes when I finger her and fuck her in missionary and maybe some oral but beyond that i'm in the dark.


She is very submissive to me both inside the bedroom and out which I like but sometimes I feel like she can be a little too submissive and I have to tell her every single thing I want her to do and I'd like it if she took a bit more initiative and just did things that she knew I liked/ wanted and take the reigns at least little bit. I get the feeling sometimes like she's just doing what I want as a service to me because that what women are supposed to do for their men and not because she has this burning desire to jump my bones which I desperately crave. She also usually never initiates which of course makes me feel a bit undesired. Once it starts and i'm fucking her we're both enjoying our selves but I do wish she would try to seduce me more.



As a side note she told be early on that she's more or less always horny and thinking about sex but I don't feel that from her very often and she even claims she never masturbates which I always thought was strange on it's own and especially for someone that claims to be thinking about sex all the time. I've asked her why she doesn't more than a few times and her answer is always ""it shouldn't be my job to get myself off"" which is maybe some indicator of why she can't tell me anything specific that she likes? because she genuinely doesn't know until she encounters it or something and doesn't explore her sexuality by her self ever.

I cannot cum, but I can get hard with a pill and I can climax her easily with a tongue, fingers and penis in positions that are fine with me moving less or no movement. 

I make alot of money as a univeristat professor and Im otherwise handsome. I have average cock of 6 inch and 6inch girth too. Sex should not be an issue.

However. We have 0 sex. She is NEVER horny or shows it. She never initiate anything.

Im worried now. I dont believe she has no desire to have sex at all. I never cought her masturbating. She never mention it. She is busy with doughter a lot. Otherwise im horny often. I crave sex and her. I jerk off online whenever at universitat alone. But she is never mooded for it. She skips it and avoids it like covid19.  
If she really wanted it we have time to do it. When doughter sleeps or left at uncle place. But she never comes up with the idea. She says is then tired, or just uses her laptop and doesnt want to be bothered.

Im starting to thinking she is cheating on me. She rarely is out without kid but sometimes yes for her yoga sessions with evidently real yoga (Female) trainer. At least trainer exists. Im not sure she doesnt cover with it for other things. I never direct asked her if she does and dont wanna to hurt her if its not cheating true but Im not confident she isnt doing it. I feel its impossible she doesnt want no sex at all. Some time I feel she is hiding it because of our doughter or money or not to hurt me.

Today I want to talk about a taboo subject: rape fantasies, particularly where a woman imagines herself as a victim of a rape. If you have suffered any trauma related to rape or sexual assault I suggest you close this post. 



This post will not be placing an emphasis on judgement but rather on how we can understand and regulate our own and others' sexual behaviour.



While hardly anyone ever talks about rape fetishes and their origin, they may be more common than you might initially guess.



""A recent analysis of 20 studies over the last 30 years indicates that between 31% and 57% of women have rape fantasies, and these fantasies are frequent or preferred in 9% to 17% of women. Considering that many people are ashamed to report rape fantasies, these stats are most likely lowball figures."" -Psychology Today



It's undeniable that rape or dub-con is present in a large part of the pornographic content aimed at women. Romance novels, fem-oriented porn games, nsfw comics, even simple fanfiction or smut online are stuffed full of non- and dubcon content. So, clearly, there must be consumers. 



 Often the people who have feel extreme guilt for it, as their sexual arousal seems to conflict with their morality. It's often worse for women whose feminist ideals are at the foreground of their lives. It becomes a battle between mental health and sexual satisfaction. 



So, if you're reading this and you have had rape fantasies, how do you find a solution? First, let's try to understand why the idea of being raped is sexually exciting to you. A large majority of women who experience rape fantasies don't actually want to be raped in real life. So what do they want? Here are some possibilities:


-Pain and submission: people with masochistic affinities will find extremely rough sex arousing.

-The feeling of being wanted: this is a big one, and likely the reason rape is so prominent in woman's porn. The idea that a person feels such overwhelming lust for them that they decide to break a huge moral and social code is arousing to many.

-Sexual guilt: a lot of women, particularly those who are brought up in conservative households, feel guilt for their sexual affinities and arousal. Being raped means that the sex was not their choice, and therefore they are free to experience it all they want with none of the ""blame"".

-Reaction to trauma: I'm not a psychologist, so I'll limit my speech on this. Some rape victims will watch a lot of rape-play pornography as a way to relive and process their experience on their own terms. The memory of a sexual situation can cause arousal, and makes people feel like they are ""broken"" for being turned on. If this is your situation, you are not broken, you just have trauma. Please talk to a therapist for help.


 If any of these are the case, please think about: how can I give myself the things that I want sexually without feeling overwhelming guilt and shame? 
 Some ideas:

-Dirty talk from your partner to make you feel more wanted 

-Taking control of your partner and asking them to do things like prove how much they want you, beg, etc

-Consensual rough sex (please do research on bdsm before you attempt anything major!! The amount of time i've seen teen girls crying with purple marks on their neck from an attempt at choking üôÑ stop)

-Slowly working on your sexual guilt. It won't happen overnight. Too many girls are left crying after losing their virginities, not by any fault of their partner, but simply because of the guilt and shame.


I want to end this by talking about CNC. CNC is consensual non-consent, where two consenting adults roleplay a rape scenario within BDSM rules (safe, sane, consensual, with aftercare). The jury is mixed on the morality of CNC. Firstly, there's a chance both the ""victim"" and the ""rapist"" will not be able to prevent a huge psychological low afterwards (guilt, shame, identity crisis). There's also the question of whether giving ""the rapist"" this outlet is positively reinforcing the desire to rape.


 Then again, the other side is that CNC can provide a safe space for consenting adults to have fun and safe sex, and that consenting adults should theoretically be allowed to do whatever legal activity they like together. There's also the argument that the ""rapist and victim"" don't actually want to be rapists and victims, but it actually stems from other things like desire for power, sadism, wanting to feel wanted, enjoying primal sex, and so on and so forth. The idea in this case is that there is a thick line between fantasy and reality. In all fairness, there is no empirical evidence to my knowledge that rape porn and CNC contribute to rape rates.


I want to end this post by encouraging everyone to keep trying to get a guilt free and healthy relationship with sexuality. I wanted to open a discussion with this post, and I would prefer if you didn't destroy all the work put into this by going down in the replies and calling people disgusting. See you  :)",1584166261.0

We've been together for about 5 months and been living together the majority of this time. Everything is cool for the most part, except for sex. We have sex almost everyday and although it's pleasurable for me I have never had an orgasm and I fake it each and every time (yes, I know it's wrong, and it is not the issue that is concerning me right now). I really do love my partner and I really want him to enjoy the sex so I try to do the things I've read online that are supposed to be pleasurable for men. For instance I do kegel during sex (meaning I tighten and loosen my vagina) and I try to thrust back according to his rhythm and not be a starfish. 
Today we had sex in missionary position and again I did the kegel and thrusted back. Right after the sex he asked me if the next time I could stay still and not do anything as he was afraid his penis might break because of my movements during sex and he fears that I might hurt myself by tightening my vagina(tearing and whatnot) I was a bit astonished to hear that cause I've always heard a girl that does nothing during sex is not desirable. Now I want to now if what he's asking is normal.. I mean it's not like I'm doing the most and am being frantic during sex.. 

Men, how do you want your girl to move in let's say missionary position?
Have you been with a girl who tightens her vagina? Did you like it?
Do you fear your penis breaking? 

Of course I'm willing to compromise and make sex more enjoyable for both of us as we go along bu I just want to know if I'm doing something wrong and out of ordinary or If his taste is just a bit weird, which is fine with me. 

I'm not experienced in sex and I feel like my partner has a bit of ego in this department, as he has mentioned several times that his penis is bigger than average (which I don't believe to be true) and won't stop until I fake my orgasm more than one time!! Can him asking me not to move be an egoistic demand? As he wants to do all?

Help/ advice from men and women,5,g2jahy,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/g2jahy/minimum_sex_for_newlyweds_help_advice_from_men/,15,"**(As usual, this is a post asking for help and advice, not an attack post)** I made a post a few months ago asking for help achieving sexual intercourse.  You can read that post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dji71c/want_to_have_sex_but_having_issues_embarrassing/) Since that post, we have had sex about four months ago. Neither party achieved orgasm. It really wasn‚Äôt our goal. Our goal was to try to learn each other‚Äôs bodies and in time that will come with practice. We didn‚Äôt want to make the ""O"" the main goal, I feel like it would make sex too mechanical. Apparently, the issue for achieving P in V was my size. It is larger than average, I guess. 

Well since that time we have *tried to have sex 7 times in the past four months,* but it doesn't last. During foreplay, she almost rushes me through it. When I try cunnilingus she says she enjoys it but then says she wants P in V but when we do P in V she wants to stop. She says it‚Äôs too intense and she is not used to the feeling. FYI, we do not have hard sex or deep sex. I am always trying to be gentle. We may try sex for about 4 mins then stop. 

I think I am concerned about her lack of desire or interest in sex. She says she has a desire, but she will rarely initiate sex. When I initiate, she typically rejects me saying she is too tired or not in the mood. We always cuddle, hold hands, and touch each other but that‚Äôs as far as it goes mostly. I would remind her how beautiful she is and sexy she is to me and she says the same. She said she has sex dreams about us, and she wakes up feeling her heartbeat in her vagina. (I assume this is a wet dream for women). When I ask her about what was it that made the dream great, she can‚Äôt remember, or it is minimum details. I want to know so I can try to fulfill her desires. I never pressure her about having sex or make her feel bad about her lack of drive, but it is driving me crazy. I am horny all the time and it is to the point where I kind of don't want her touching me because I become aroused just to end the night with hidden sexual frustration. I never reject her though. And to make matters worse is we have new neighbors that have insanely loud passionate sex and I can‚Äôt sleep at night. I find myself looking forward to hearing them and wanting what they have. It turns me on and frustrates me at the same time. And I feel this is wrong. 

I am beginning to wonder if there is something wrong with me. I started going back to the gym to get back into serious shape. I used to be insanely fit but since I have been going through grad school and working at the same time, I am more normally fit. I am trying to read and apply books like"" she comes first"" and others. Because what if I am doing something wrong. Has anyone else gone through a similar situation? How did you overcome this. (I don't want to pressure her but I kind of do want to pressure her. yes i know this thought is wrong which is why i havn't done so.)  I have a feeling my wife might be Ace.

I‚Äôve been doing some reading on this subreddit and a bunch of other equally related subreddits about this issue but have some differences in my story that I wanna put forward to get some advice on. 

My girlfriend of 16 months has had some fairly intense mental health struggles in her life and suffers from anxiety and mostly depression. We both share similar mental health experiences on varying levels so it‚Äôs never been an issue to talk about freely with each other. Both of us are on medication (SSRI‚Äôs) however her being in Zoloft has completely numbed any physical sensation that‚Äôs possible through any sex and has consequently impacted her sex drive. To the point we‚Äôre we go months without sex and when we do eventually have it, it‚Äôs clear she‚Äôs only doing it for me and isn‚Äôt herself getting anything out of it. 

It‚Äôs become quite damaging to me and my sexual confidence to not feel wanted or not feel desired but I love her to pieces and completely understand how it‚Äôs effecting her just as much to not be able to be intimate with me. I‚Äôve expressed myself in regards to this and it crushes her to have me think this way almost as much as she says it crushes her to feel ‚Äúbroken‚Äù or like she‚Äôs failing me. 

I‚Äôve suggested she does everything in her power to hopefully stimulate sexual desire again but nothing seems to be working for her. She‚Äôs tried changing medication but that threw her completely off the rails mentally and wasn‚Äôt even worth continuing for the sake of her health. She‚Äôs tried her best masturbate more but it just makes her sad to literally feel nothing. She regularly sees a therapist to address this issue amongst other things. I‚Äôm not expecting her to change her meds again because Zoloft really helps with her mental state and to ask her to change again and risk it for sexual purposes only is unfair of me. 

It‚Äôs now been almost 2 months since we last had sex and this problem has started to boil over in my head a lot more then it had in the past. Sex to me now when it eventually does happen again is just going to feel empty because I know she‚Äôs not feeling anything. Knowing this takes more then half the fun out of it because a lot of what I loved to do was get her off because it made me feel good that she felt good. Now knowing that anything I‚Äôm trying is just doing nothing for her just makes the whole act feel a little bit pointless and selfish from my end. 

I‚Äôm not one to ever let something like this break the two of us up, but it does feel like this is something that can easily snowball into a much larger issue and push the two of us apart. Sex to me is a huge part of a relationship as it is for her and not being able to share that fully is crushing us both but more so her. 

If anyone‚Äôs got some advice for me, whatever it may be that would be much appreciate.

Sometimes I‚Äôll try to initiate it or seduce him, but it only leads to something about 20% of the time. I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs like this, but I‚Äôve always been really insecure about my body (Im not sure why exactly, I‚Äôm petite and have a average build) and even almost 7 years in I still get self conscious during foreplay and it takes me a while to get over it every time.

I'm slightly confused and muddled over the morality of forcefully given hickeys.
My partner and I are have been married for 1.5 years, together for 3. We're in a normal, happy and a loving relationship. He is a gentle and a loving guy, right from the start, but he kinda has always had this thing for hickeys which I can't understand nor can he explain to me. From his face, it looks like he's amused giving them and seeing them later. I'm not very comfortable with having them, because my introversion pulls me back from showing people a part of my personal life stamped on my neck. He knows this, and has known this ever since we started seeing each other. Recently, I straight out told him I'm not into it. Last night, he wanted to give me one, saying that nobody would have a chance to see, but we live with his parents (it's normal where I come from) and it's extra embarrassing for me when they can see it. I kept saying no but he just.. plainly, he just went ahead and did it. It's not pleasurable for me and it hurts, that's all. And it won't go away for days.
Now as I sit here, I'm wondering if I'm just over reacting to the situation or he really doesn't respect my boundaries. Do non-consensual hickeys classify as assault?",1587247426.0

I was horny, so I opened up my favourite porn and starting masturbating my penis. My goal was this. I've ordered a prostate toy and it's coming this week and I can't wait to try it. I'm sure that I'll try it immediately when it arrives, so I thought that maybe I shouldn't be masturbating for a few days before starting my prostate play. I've never played with my prostate ever before, so I'm really excited and I've read in many articles and posts on this subreddit too that not masturbating for a few days before prostate play will help a lot and be a lot more pleasurable, so I wasn't going to masturbate for a week before starting my prostate play, but today I was really horny, so I thought that I'll masturbate for twenty minutes, get pleasure and then not orgasm at all. Just edging for twenty minutes and not having an orgasm and ejaculating. So it was going good, I was having a good session, it was pleasurable and I was feeling really happy. So there are three stages of my masturbation according to me; the first one is stimulation, the second is the ""feeling so good"" feeling, and then I reach the point of no return and I have an orgasm and ejaculate. So I was going till the second stage multiple times and just before the third stage, I would pull my hands back and not touch the penis till I go back to the first stage, basically edging. So I was edging very well for 20 minutes and I was really happy and it was a very satisfying session, so I thought of edging for just another time and winding up. So I was stroking and I reached stage 2 and it was feeling so good, but I didn't stop and I accidentally stimulated my penis a little bit more than I had to and I went to the third stage. As soon as I hit the point of no return, I realised it and started yelling ""nooo nooo nooo"" and I ejaculated. I didn't really feel the orgasm due to my panic, but it had happened and it was a complete waste, a ruined orgasm. FUCK!!! I'm regretting it so much now. 

Now I'd want to know how long I should wait till I use the toy. Is 2-3 days of no masturbation enough to start prostate play? I'm really frustrated now, I really want to know how long I have to wait, I really can't wait, the toy is coming in 2-3 days, is that enough time for my sexual energy to build up? Or should I wait for a week? Thanks folks!",1588623987.0

I'm well over that negative line of thinking now.

I've been realizing that one of the things I crave is being wanted - desired - needed. He just never *has to have me*.

Which is how many people have unprotected sex on here? Everyone right? But if I ask how many people have had unprotected sex with strangers that they met online? Everyone wouldn‚Äôt able to relate or wouldn‚Äôt admit it right? 
The point of the matter is, over the years I experience many bareback encounters with women I met on free dating apps like Plenty of Fish and Tinder to social media apps like Facebook and Instagram. Some might say that is bad but for me? It became a fetish or thrill over the years. Luckily I never caught a STD but I experience many pregnancy scares. 15 to be exact, which made me ask my past sexual encounters WHY?!?! 
Why were they okay with me cumin‚Äô inside of them? Why they made me giving them a creampie optional? My answers was often ‚Äúwe‚Äôll make cute mix babies‚Äù or ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôll be hot if you finish inside me.‚Äù Mind you they barely knew me. But base off my looks? Since I‚Äôm a handsome black male in their eyes ? All morals and logical thinking goes out the window when your a victim of lust I suppose.
I should also mention most of these women was white so over the years I came up with a interracial theory.... which I believe is a pop culture social trend to a degree. Millennials like myself aren‚Äôt shy about dating outside their race. What was once looked at as jungle fever became a normal way of living for my generation. At least that‚Äôs how it is here in Ohio where I‚Äôll often see a single mother with biracial children at any local Walmart in the Southwest Ohio area. But sometimes I think it might be because these white women in the buckeye state are purposely breeding with black guys that they met online like myself. Why? Because mix babies became a white girl desire when it comes to motherhood. Call them designer babies if you will but it‚Äôs a growing trend like a twilight zone.
Blame the sports or the music but one thing for sure is? White women seem to not only like having sex with black guys but they also feel this need to be bred by them. And it‚Äôs nothing wrong with procreating but I call it a fetish because I know personally? The women I risk impregnating was women I didn‚Äôt care to be with. In my eyes some of them were only something to get my rocks off to and I know that might sounds bad and all but it became a major turn on to be able to have skin to skin raw sex with women that probably didn‚Äôt even know my last name.
Nowadays I chill out. I stop risking knocking up women since the spring of 2017. During that time I had six different women claiming they was pregnant by me and well it scared me straight enough to stop. All their pregnancy scares resulted to miscarriages or abortions. (If they was in fact pregnant. Never know if it might‚Äôve been a lie because well people lie.) But nothing is new under the sun and ever since then?

I love him so much and this is the best and most emotionally fulfilling relationship I've ever had. The same can't be said for our sex life.  


We never had that sexual spark, at least not on my end. He's super cute and I DO find him attractive, but not necessarily in a... sexy way. Our sex is very just, I don't know. It just is? It just is what it is. There are no passionate moments, no desperation, nothing sexy and there never has been. There has been maybe one time when I hadn't seen him for a couple of weeks at the beginning of our relationship, and my abusive ex finally was off of my lease and had no right to show up at my house anymore, and I just felt FREE and wanted him so bad. That was the closest we've ever gotten to that spark. The other day I was feeling pretty vulnerable, in a good way, and just more than anything wanted to have some sort of passionate and romantic sex with him and tried my best to get it to happen. No luck. I actually got really emotional after this and started crying, and I tried to explain to him what was going on and what I wanted but it was hard to articulate, and he started getting defensive and making excuses so I didn't feel it was worth continuing the conversation. He just seems to have one emotion during sex, and it isn't anything other than... cheery? Not cheery with a pinch of sensual or a pinch of anything, just cheery. Like you've gone for a nice stroll in the park. That is the attitude he brings to sex. Recently, I'll find myself getting horny and trying to turn it off or even start feeling kind of repulsed because the kind of sex we have isn't what I want.  


This used to be fine. It was just whatever, at least it got the job done and I was able to get off and so was he, and our relationship was amazing in other ways so it just didn't bother me and I figured it wouldn't since my antidepressants suppress my libido a fair bit. Recently, its been bothering me. I've been having dreams about other men (not actual men I know, made up men in my head) and sometimes we have sex but the main theme of the dreams is just the sexual tension and really craving that feeling of longing for somebody. Its gotten to a point where I keep finding myself daydreaming about sex with my ex, who was a horrible person but the best sex I've ever had and we never lost that sexual chemistry throughout our relationship. I also find myself longing for the days where I'd go on dates with people and have that first few excited weeks of hooking up with someone. I just really miss feeling desire, and feeling desired in return. At the risk of sounding like an arrogant piece of shit, I'm what you'd call ""conventionally attractive"" I suppose and always been the ""sexy"" girl so I've never had trouble in this regard. This is completely new to me.  


I love my boyfriend and I feel awful about this. I really hope this doesn't affect our relationship further. I would like to think I'd be happy sacrificing my deeper sexuality for this amazing relationship, but I'm worried that these feelings might grow and become too big of a problem. Are we just incompatible? Can a relationship survive if the sex isn't fab? Can I get over this? Will I ever be able to see my partner as sexually appealing? Can I do anything in bed to spark these feelings? I'm just questioning everything now.",1587225365.0

I‚Äôve been able to experience men of different cultures and races and ages.  And the best part of it is, my husband is always there with me, protecting me and loving me.

Honestly that‚Äôs the problem. Through this journey I‚Äôve sort of scratched my itch so to speak? I was a virgin when I met my husband and until that night about five years ago when I was first shared I hadn‚Äôt been with anyone else. My husband had many other partners though before me.

I just want my husband, this whole journey has made me love him more than I ever had and I was over the moon for him to begin with.

And that‚Äôs a problem - he doesn‚Äôt want me to stop. He gets just as much pleasure if not more from me sleeping with other men than I do. He enjoys watching or hearing about it , etc. He desperately wants me to continue even though he knows I want to stop. He thinks I just need a break , which I‚Äôm on, but he‚Äôs insisting I‚Äôll be ready soon.

Anyway, diving into the problems, her lower sex drive kinda makes me feel unwanted. Sometimes I feel like when we‚Äôve had sex recently, she never wanted to. We talked about it she reassured if she didn‚Äôt want to she would say no. But most time she lacks enthusiasm and confidence during sex, and it feels like I‚Äôm the only one enjoying it.

I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm starting to think about the last girl I was with before my girlfriend. We had nothing in common but the sex was A+ and she loved dirty talk and I felt so good about myself and felt so sought after by this girl.

I really do love my current girlfriend but I just want that feeling of being desired and sought after, like the guy everyone wants, but I don‚Äôt feel like that right now. Is there anything I can do to help fix that?

I also started masturbaing and watching porn involving men at 15. At 16 I was so heavily horny over anything like literally anything like all day long and I masturbated like 2 times a day at least  etc... But my interest was in both males and females I guess. Like I got aroused by a wet vagina. And liked to watch straight porn generally. I also liked seeing boobs but I have a boob insecurity I have like ugly boobs basically they sag and are b cups so it was like sexual jealousy as far bigger better boobs. Anyhow I would get curious about my friend and one time I ended up fingering her and I really liked it got really aroused by her getting wet and climaxed later on. And after that I convinced her into letting me give her oral and experimenting I guess. So well these encounters definitely made me experience a lot of orgasms but I still it was like anything sexual would get me off back then and I think I went down on her like 60 to 70 times in like 3 months and I really needed actually more because I just was so overly stimulated in my genitals for some weird reason no matter what  during this time I would still look at guys mainly and wanted sex with like anyone. But in part I didn't actually have a care about who I got off to. I did it with another girl too during this time. But I kind of was just realy really horny over everything come my 17th birthday I don't get aroused with like seeing pussy but I had a really bad desire as far as like craving sex with a guy I never really noticed girls it's just when nude I could enjoy going down on them and pleasing now it kinda is like unappealing to me. And I have no interest in females during that year I did not currently.

9,9,For women who cannot orgasm,2381,fyo2dr,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/fyo2dr/for_women_who_cannot_orgasm/,152,"TL:DR at the bottom. 
I don't know who needs to hear this. But I just got myself off and feel like I need to make the post I've been putting off for so long.

For 21 years I was convinced I was anorgasmic, meaning I couldn't orgasm. And i had been very sexual since the age of 11-12. I tried to rub my clit, even used a bullet vibrator, but it didnt feel good, penetration was fine but not orgasmic. Slept with men who claimed they have made every woman cum and then end up feeling worthless and guilty for being the first one they didnt. I soon accepted I will never experience this miraculous orgasm. 

But I got interested in toys. I got myself a bullet vibe and a rabbit. The bullet was eh, it didnt feel amazeballs. But the rabbit tho.. It didnt feel amazing at first also, but around 20 minutes into using it, I could feel something happening. I got my very first orgasm. I was thrilled! I spent a few months using it daily. But after it broke, I had to resort to other things. I still had my vibe but I didnt believe it would work. Still, I gave it a shot. It took some time to get used to it, to figure out what motion feels nice. Yes, it was vibrating but you still need to give it some extra motion. Eventually I got an orgasm with my vibe and the more i used it, the easier it got. I started wondering if I could still give my fingers another shot and again, with some learning progress, i managed to finally get myself off by using fingers.

My point is, learning how to orgasm comes easy (pun unintended) for some women, for some, it takes much more time but in the end, we all have to LEARN it. Operating a clit is very complicated and detailed. Maybe you like it directly on the clit, maybe right above it, maybe sligthly to the left or even around it. The exact pressure and motion also matters. For me, its above the clit, in strong rotational motion.  If you cannot orgasm, don't rely on men to figure it out, experiment yourself first and dont give up. I promise, it will happen. And while it doesnt, its fine, you are not broken.

I wanted to write this out because I knew I would have needed someone to tell me this a year ago.

TL:DR if you cannot orgasm now, unless its medically proven, you really just need to put some time and effort into learning your body, and I promise, it will Eventually happen

This first section of questions applies to **straight men**:  
1- Would you let a woman lick your butthole? Would you want her to?  
2- Would you let a woman put a finger in your butt? Would you want her to?  
3 - Would you let a woman use a toy in your butt? (something more substantial than a butt plug) Would you want her to?  
4 - Would you let a woman use a strap-on on you? Would you want her to?  
\*edit\* 5- Would you use an anal toy on yourself?

**Women's** **section:**  
5, 6, 7, 8, 9 - All the above questions except; would you do these things, and would enjoy doing them?  
10 - If your man didn't want to do one or more of the above, would you ever encourage him to try one or more of them? Which one(s) would it be?",1590311513.0
24,24,Orgasms for women are easier to achieve when you do it for her. Not for you.,463,fxz5h8,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/fxz5h8/orgasms_for_women_are_easier_to_achieve_when_you/,47,"This is mainly for the men on this sub but women, if you find anything inaccurate or you resonate with anything, feel free to let us know. 

Where do I start... As most people on this sub should know, female orgasms are difficult to achieve. It requires a lot more work and time to get a woman to have the same feeling as you. Men find that frustrating because, in a relationship, it makes us feel inadequate. ""If I can't make her cum, what if she leaves me for a guy who can?"" Making a woman cum is a sense of pride for a man as it should be. It's not easy. If you can do it, be proud of yourself. The issue is when an orgasm is the goal. When you prioritize female climax, sex becomes selfish. This is why, so often, women feel objectified. Not because we WANT to fuck them (they are just as horny as we are) but WHY we want to fuck them. It's like that telemarketer calling you with ""a deal that's going to change your life"". He sounds super happy and like he cares but, in reality, he just wants to get his numbers up. This mentality doesn't work with sex. Imagine the worst handjob you've ever received. Why was it bad? Usually because your partner is only doing it to get you off. Same thing goes for females. They can tell when you're trying to get them off and that puts pressure on them and sucks out the fun. And there is the point. Female orgasms come from enjoyment.

So, if orgasm isn't the goal, what is? Pleasure. This might sound like one in the same but it's not. Orgasms come from pleasure but pleasure doesn't always lead to orgasms. Which is fine. Here is the issue men have. We are stuck in a mentality of ""if I'm not the best, I'm the worst"" which, in this situation sucks for your partner and yourself. We need to come to a point to say, ""if I maximize her pleasure, I've done my job"" because not all women get orgasms and some get them rarely but an orgasm-less night of sex doesn't necessarily mean bad sex. If you did good, the hold that w. You did what you were supposed to. But also don't be afraid to ask what you could have done better. If you take that criticism seriously, you'll probably get an orgasm next time (which, again, is not the goal, it's a bonus) 

Why do I say all this? I see too often, on this sub and irl, women not wanting to have sex because it's too much work or not worth their time and I think the male mentality has a huge role to play in that. I want to change to male mentality so that both parties can win because I think sex is a beautiful thing that everyone should enjoy and be able/want to do more often. 

TL;DR If you have sex to give her an orgasm, it won't work cause it's selfish. If you have sex to give her pleasure, she'll get an orgasm.

Update: holy crap this is getting bigger than I expected so let me make a clarification. When I made the statement ""female orgasms are difficult"", that was meant to be in the context of the male orgasm. A dick is simple to get off. A vagina takes more time and technique than a dick. It is not impossible or all that difficult if you understand the differences but when a guy who has only known ""shake dick, make cum"", it's not that simple. Please understand that I know the women making comments saying ""female orgasms aren't hard to achieve"" are right but also understand that you are seeing that through the eyes of a female. We don't get to see that perspective so, for a guy who doesn't know any better, it IS difficult (until he learns)

Long time lurker and first time poster! So, I (29F) spent my whole life not knowing, until today, what an orgasm _really_ felt like. I had used vibrators since my early 20's and was pretty satisfied with them, until I got a fancier rabbit model, and now, after 10ish uses, WHOA. It finally, trully happened.

When I masturbated before, I always felt a kind of unvoluntary twitching, followed by very intense, sometimes painful sensation, so much that I had to stop right away before feeling disappointed that I couldn't climax. I thought the twitching was the orgasm and was a little unimpressed.

But today, for the first time, I can say with some confidence, that I had my first ""real"" orgasm. 

At first I thought I had to use the very upper tips of the ""bunny ears"" to stimulate the clit - and was getting very pleasurable results by doing this. But today I thought I'd try to place the dildo part deeper, so that the clit was getting more stimulus through the ""base"" os the joint bunny ears, which form a ""V"" shape. 

That way, the tips of the ears were stimulating the vulva, and I felt a deeper overall stimulus, instead of a ""stonger""one just on the surface. Also, I had better luck using the ""pulsating"" vibration setting on the vibe instead of the ""continuous"" vibration setting :)

And the best way to describe it is that it has very little to do with the ""twitching"" sensation. The twitching makes me think it's just an involuntary reaction to being touched a certain way. To me, the real orgasm felt like there is a warm sensation ""building up"" and slowly spreading through your body, and then you start (or at least I did) to feel a pulsating sensation, lining up with the ""building up"" sensation, and then you get a sort of ""explosion"" - not too strong, but really pleasurable - I even got my ears ringing a little.

Then you can't move or think for a little while (depending on how strong they were, probably?).

I'm sure not all women experience them the same way, but I just wanted to share that in my case, I spent my life believing orgasms were one thing (a little underwhelming tbh), and found out today that they felt like a completely different thing. It was a mind blowing surprise, and I thought I'd share it with you guys, in hopes of helping and encouraging more women to correctly identify their orgasms!

Edit: I just woke up to so many replies and I'm so so happy to add to the conversation! Let's get those orgasms, girls! Also, thanks for the silver :)

Edit 2: there were a lot of people asking what vibrator it was, and since I bought it at a sex shop outside the US and threw away the box, I can't say the precise model and brand. But it looks a lot like this: https://www.amazon.com/Vibration-Beginners-PALOQUETH-Stimulator-Waterproof/dp/B07R9ZTBDH. Also some people are saying it's not exactly safe to get sex toys from amazon, so do your research. I did get mine at a quality store and spent approximately 100 dollars, but I am sure there are quality vibes in the market for a lot less.",1581158035.0

I was watching a music video where the girlfriend dressed her partner up as a woman and it was hot!!! Last night, after a couple drinks, I asked my boyfriend if he would have sex with me while wearing a dress. At first he said no, but then said he was curious and if he tore down his ego a bit he could definitely see himself doing it. I'm bi so he was wondering if it was a bi thing but I told him it wasn't. For me, I think it's so hot for a guy to be comfortable enough in his masculinity that he can do your brains out while wearing a dress. My guy has a beard and I told him that's part of the appeal for me, not for him to look like a woman.

I was wondering what other ladies find hot about this kink and wanted to start a discussion.

Frankly, as a woman, I feel like we go through so much already. The idea is concubine-ish in the sense that our society promotes MFF to an extensive degree. Lesbianism is a sexuality. Not for your entertainment. I honestly feel very disappointed and hurt when the guy I‚Äôm dating is so wonderful and then one day he asks for a threesome or anal. 

I‚Äôve discussed this with my friends and they agree. It hurts them too that their boyfriends would ask for such a thing. It makes us feel like we‚Äôre not enough down there, and I always see the man a bit differently after he asks. I feel sad. We want to feel enough for you down there, and we want to be the only ones that you want to a point where thinking of another woman ruining what we have is so far down the drain that you wouldn‚Äôt even risk asking unless we do. 

Anal is often painful or simply tolerable for many women, and unless a woman suggests it first, I feel like men shouldn‚Äôt push for it. It‚Äôs my body. There‚Äôs no real physical pleasure I‚Äôm getting out of it. Many women cannot achieve orgasm that way. And there‚Äôs so much prep that I (ME) have to do.

So on speaking to my boyfriend about his porn preferences, seems he only is able to get off to really, really degrading stuff. Like women being gang banged and treated extremely roughly or forced face fucking. 

He‚Äôs told me this is the stuff he finds hot and 

I‚Äôve also had a problem with some misogynistic comments of his. He has major double standards when it comes to men and women. He‚Äôs slut-shamed me on multiple occasions for my (very normal) sexual past and has this idea that women are degraded for doing things like giving head or having casual sex..... but men obviously get a free pass. It has led to more than one argument because he‚Äôs told me I‚Äôve degraded myself for doing totally standard things like giving my exes head (seriously). 

Beyond that, what are your opinions/experiences with this? It could be that it‚Äôs just a hidden fantasy but he does tend to use similar languages and fantasies to me in bed together so I‚Äôm starting to wonder if it‚Äôs actually negatively impacted his view on women in general. Like maybe the reason he sees head as degrading is because he‚Äôs only into seeing oral sex in such a degrading and forced manner. 

I could be way off the mark, but his slut-shaming and general disrespect are making me worried that his porn preferences have a part to play in it and what he likes. Am I just over thinking it..... it‚Äôs just porn after all?",1589532289.0

From their perspective, getting unsolicited nudes from any woman who's at least reasonably attractive would be great, and they'd totally love it. I get that.

But understand that it generally doesn't work the same way for us. I can't imagine enjoying some random guy out of nowhere just sending me a picture of his penis and expect me to enjoy it. The only reaction I would have aside from disgust is just confusion - how am i supposed to enjoy that? I actually recently discovered that I'm possibly bisexual, although even then I'm only attracted to a tiny percentage of women - even if the most attractive woman were to send me an unsolicited nude of hers, I would have the **same reaction**. If I had any romantic interest in someone, I would lose most if not all of my attraction to them if they were to send me a nude pic without asking me first (and even then I'd probably decline until we become closer).

I get that men are different and tend to be the complete opposite - that a girl you're briefly talking to sending you nudes out of nowhere would likely *increase* your attraction to her. Or that you wouldn't be as turned off if it's a complete female stranger who's at least somewhat attractive.

My point is, men and women are different. What attracts you is not what attracts other people, like in this case. I'm not sure if I can even explain it - maybe it's biological, maybe we're just socialized differently. But as it is, women seem to require some sort of context when it comes to visual stimulation, moreso than men. Men tend to not need much of context, which may perhaps explain why they don't mind as much when a stranger hits them up.

The same seems to apply to gays and lesbians. I've noticed that the first thing gay men do on their dating apps is send each other nudes, and then immediately meeting each other to fuck. Speaking to my lesbian friends, it doesn't seem that they are as interested in doing that to each other; they tend to attempt to form some romantic connection *before* going sexual, and don't send nudes until they are deeper into the relationship. One of my lesbian friends told me about how she lost a lot of respect for this one girl who she initially found attractive, but ruined it by sending her a video of her masturbating without asking. She calls girls like this ""lesbian fuckboys"", apparently.

It sucks that men and women are different. It really does. I wish that men were more like women, or women were more like men. In either case, our interests would match and no one would complain. But as it is, men and women are different. Male sexuality and female sexuality are different.

So to men who send unsolicited dick pics, remember that when you are sending it to a woman, bear in mind that **women are not men**! We are NOT the same! Gay men can sure continue just sending random nudes to each other, and that's fine and I'm happy for them. Straight men on the other hand will have to accept that it's not the same for women.

----

And I just want to add that I'm not intending to generalize; my post is about **tendencies**. There's a strong *tendency* for people who'd enjoy sending/receiving unsolicited nudes to be men, and there's a strong *tendency* for those who'd not enjoy such to be women. I  am not saying anywhere that all men do this or all women don't do this; it's simply the tendency.",1585784373.0
54,54,Women! I[25M] need your input about my sexual advances on my past relationship with my ex[22F].,8,giuvks,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/giuvks/women_i25m_need_your_input_about_my_sexual/,12,"I was 25 and she was 22 at the time this occurred. I have a 5000 word break down of everything that happened, in my profile. You can read if you have the time, no pressure. I thought I was doing better 7 months later, but the past 2 days have been impossible for me. Flicking on a light string triggered so many memories, I went on her Facebook and realized she has deleted my friends from her account now.. I feel she'll get rid of me soon too.

Anyway, I wanted to be an open book and ask if I am entirely wrong or if what happened between us is just amplified to be worse.

WARNING, EVERYTHING IS ABOUT TO BE ABOUT SEX. Because that's what I wanted to discuss.

A couple disclaimers:

‚Ä¢ She and I were each other's firsts, she actually made the first move for us to kiss and to have sex, I didn't want to push her. We both discovered everything together. Except kissing, she had made out with plenty of guys before.. kinda made me feel bad that I couldn't ""French kiss"".

‚Ä¢ I never intend on treating her as a sex toy. When she says no, it means no. She would sometimes offer to go down on me instead, to which I've always replied to with ""You're my girlfriend, not my sex toy."" And I turn her down from just getting me off... I know how badly I would have loved it though.

‚Ä¢ She would always finish me in her mouth, then run to the bathroom to spit. I always feel bad, and had I told her that she doesn't need to do that. But she said ""It's fine."" If I did finish on her, I would always get a towel or something while she waits.

Having said these, here's my list I want ""validation"" for, I guess. Probably a good thing to note, about 2 weeks before the first incident on this list, she did try to break up before I left to go overseas for uni. The whole list is in order of occurrence. Her reasoning was ""I don't know what you are doing with your life!"", I was depressed about leaving her, been a bit uninteresting for about a month while I battled myself over this decision, but it was quite clear I am going to go try it out.

‚Ä¢ Before I went overseas for study, I told her I want to take sexy photos of her. She agreed, and we did a little photoshoot, I asked her if she can be naked. She seemed hesitant then she said ""You can't show anyone"", I reply with ""Of course not, who do you think I am?"". Sure enough, she got naked, I took some photos, but I didn't ask her to do any sex acts, just pose really. She did, and I got some artsy nude shots of her. Then when we were about to have sex and I asked if I can record us, she said no, I put the camera down and we made love. Went to dinner with my family and took her back home, cuddled and watched a movie before I went home. Should I have not done the shoot?

‚Ä¢ Couple days later, on the way to my university overseas, I sent her a message saying we should do our best to keep our sex life alive over Snapchat or something. She goes offline for about 2 hours, returns later and says ""I knew you'd bring this up"", or something of the sorts, then she replies with ""Yes, we should try."" First thing she tells me when I get to my dorm is to send her a sexy photo, so I do.

Over the next 3 or so days, I send her 1 unsolicited nude for her viewing pleasure. She would say ""ooo sexy"" or something in reply. She'd send me a nude or two as well. One day she says ""Is this going to be a daily thing?"" And that's when I cut out sending nudes, I sent a satirical one with my body censored ""Fine you get none of this"". She laughs, screenshots and sends it back on Facebook. We laugh it off.

‚Ä¢ I would ask her for nudes. When she said no, I wouldn't pressure. When she did send it, I asked her to touch herself for me, which she didn't do. But she did sexy talk back instead. I sent her a 5 second clip, while we were having a bit of fun, of me stroking to her picture. She replied with ""gosh I hate seeing myself naked"". That was the only time I sent her any memory of those shots.

‚Ä¢ One day I sent her a coded message. I wrote her some erotica since she loves reading that stuff. I wrote about how we'd have sex when we meet again. She replied to me with a coded message, it read that it turned her on so much and she just wants me inside of her right now. I was in class, we messaged a little back and forth. When I got home, I wrote her another paragraph... This time she giggled, it felt a bit condescending, I know her little mannerisms and speech patterns. Didn't sound too interested this time.

3 weeks into my move, she goes on holiday at this point, with her brother, then wanted to breakup again... Or go on a break. We settled on a break than lasted 20 hours, because she said let's do what's best for us instead.

‚Ä¢ She constantly wanted space, but then we'd start talking again. When we are in a talking phase, and I get horny, I do message her asking for nudes, or her to play with herself for me (obviously I try turning her on and easing into it). This time she'd say ""Its hard right now"", as in to say No. Which I understood and didn't ask for another few days. You see, we've had space between us before when we travelled, and I have messaged/she had messaged me the same way, more me than her, we've both obliged and we've really enjoyed it. After the tension this time, I found it was just me trying, so at one point I stopped asking as well.

She did break up with me after a month of taking space and coming back, then taking space and coming back, then taking space.

After our break-up, she continued to tell me she loved me (twice) when I went back home (I couldn't handle the stress of med school and this break up.)

Anyway, I'll cut it there for now, the whole story is in my profile. I just wanted to know if I sexually crossed any lines. I feel like everything I've done is wrong because I am literally being treated like garbage by her and people from her side.

Just so we are clear, after our break up, I did apologize to her about my flaws and for not giving her the security and confidence in me.

It‚Äôs horrifying because I don‚Äôt really know their sexual history (and vice versa) or how many other women they‚Äôve done this to.

I get it - we‚Äôre in the moment, things are getting hot and heavy, and condoms suck for a myriad of reasons... but safety first, dudes.

**EDIT:** Wow! Woke up to this thread blowing up. Thank you to everyone who shared their thoughts and personal experiences. The number of people - men and women - who have undergone something similar is truly astonishing. And stealthing?! Fucking hell... that's insane! I don't even know where to begin on that and I am so, so sorry for anyone who has experienced such a blatant violation of your bodily autonomy.

Condom usage isn't just about preventing pregnancies. What about STIs?! I'm not willing to risk my body and future for a momentary boost in pleasure, especially for someone that I barely know. You'd think the possibility of a baby or catching something would be enough of a deterrent...

Also, for people suggesting that I screen my casual partners better, I will say that I could have been more stringent about those I decided to be intimate with. It's hard to discern sometimes, but that's where communication comes in. I wholeheartedly stand behind discussions about sex/preferences/consent and encourage it beforehand, but I mistakenly assumed that everyone else thought condom usage was standard practice. Lesson learned. My personal boundary is condom always until we both get tested and are having exclusive sex or until we enter into a monogamous relationship. Since then, I've taken a break from casual sex and I don't feel compelled to go back to it anytime soon. I just hope that we can all continue talking about/advocating for sex education as well as safe, fun, and consensual sex as it seems we have quite a ways to go!",1589799712.0

This is because there seems to be too much of a difference between men and women in the enjoyment of sex and the amount of pleasure they receive during sex, and I feel sorry for the men.

For example, I can enjoy the pleasure of vagina, anus, tits, kissing, back, hair, etc., all over my body, and the man caresses me all over my body. What's more, unlike men, I can have multiple orgasms in a single sex session if I'm in the right mood, and I feel like I'm in heaven. What's more, right after sex, I feel so tired and satisfied that I can't move.

However, I don't feel like I'm giving back enough pleasure compared to the amount he can give me, because men only enjoy the pleasure of a penis or a kiss. The number of orgasms varies from person to person, but it's only 3 or 4 at most, or 1 if it's severe.

The same applies to female gamers' followers, etc

Although there's a popular belief that porn twists male's perception of beauty, it does not take a girl to be an Instagram model to furiously give a boner to a guy. 

Guys are extremely forgiven and tolerant when it comes to girls' inexperience, awkwardness and some 'dealbreakers' if they can advance to sex. When they meet/come across a girl anywhere, they are planning ways to impress her, make her laugh/at ease and are always on the look out if she can give them a chance to take her out.

I have a billion girlfriends who fake orgasms throughout the entire relationship. I‚Äôve faked for an entire relationship. I don‚Äôt think guys really understand how common it is to fake and how much pressure it can put on your relationship.

Before you go, ‚Äònah my girl wouldn‚Äôt do that, plus I can tell that they‚Äôre real‚Äô, I promise you that if she wants to fake and have you not know, you will not know. A lot of the time girls start faking right off the bat because they don‚Äôt feel comfortable taking their time or giving directions when they‚Äôre with you for the first time. 

And once you fake once in a relationship, it‚Äôs a really hard rut to get out of. When she fakes the first time she‚Äôs already set the standard for how long it takes her and what you have to do to get her there, when in reality you might need a lot more guidance and time to get her off. 

I‚Äôve been in a position where I had been faking from the get-go and ended up trying to show him how to finish me but because I was taking much longer than I ‚Äòusually did‚Äô, he got discouraged and gave up. 

Girls need to come just as much as guys do. Imagine if you were in a relationship and having sex for two months and hadn‚Äôt come. Imagine 6 months. Imagine 2 years. It‚Äôs the exact same for a girl. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating and puts a barrier in between you two and you might not even know about it. It puts pressure on your relationship and makes her wonder if there are other options out there.

It can be really, really hard to tell someone that you‚Äôve been faking the entire time because you can feel really silly and self conscious and nobody wants to bruise their partner‚Äôs ego. I‚Äôm gonna be honest, few women are ever going to bring up the fact that they‚Äôre faking and sooooooo many are. Btw don‚Äôt get mad at girls if they are faking, girls learn that they should be coming on command like in porn and movies and think if they don‚Äôt, something is wrong with them.

If I had been sat down by my s/o and seriously asked if I‚Äôd been coming, I would have been so much more comfortable telling them the truth. If a boy had given me an out and told me that they wouldn‚Äôt be hurt but they just needed to know, that would have been such a relief and my relationships when I was younger probably wouldn‚Äôt have ended because of all of the frustration on my end.

So. I need you to sit your girl down and say these words: ‚Äúhey, I wanna make sure that you‚Äôre finishing. I know that a lot of girls pretend to finish to make their partner feel better, but Id rather have to relearn how to do it or take more time to do it than have you not finishing. It‚Äôs totally okay if you‚Äôre not, but it‚Äôs important to me to know if you aren‚Äôt so we can figure it out. You know you can tell me if you aren‚Äôt finishing, right?‚Äù ( that last line used to say, ‚ÄúHave you ever pretended to finish?‚Äù instead, but after some talk in the comments, we thought this would be better and less accusatory)

This is a *sensitive* topic for women. They might initially say no even if they are. Make sure she knows she could always tell you, no matter what, if she ever had been. I promise this talk will only do good things for your relationship. If she‚Äôs faking, it gives her an out. If she‚Äôs not, it shows what a great guy you are for having a talk just to make sure she‚Äôs coming.


Edit: just so y‚Äôall understand how prevalent faking is:

in 2010 researchers found that about 80% of women fake about half the time. Later they found that 25% of women fake every time they have sex. 

If you can look at that and say, ‚Äúwelp, sounds like a you problem‚Äù, that‚Äôs an issue. Faking literally isn‚Äôt talked about and many women have no idea how to bring it up. That info is finally getting circulated more, but men can help too. By showing that you‚Äôre invested in making sure she‚Äôs satisfied and recognizing that faking is super common, you can take the edge off of the conversation. 

Also I‚Äôm not saying that everybody is faking. I‚Äôm just saying it would be uncool to ignore how prevalent it is.",1588347214.0

Please also keep in mind I am generalizing and am not attacking men here I legitimately want to hear some views because I'm struggling with this. 

This is something that has been increasingly bothering me and quite honestly majorly turning me off and making me feel very confused and even uncomfortable at times. I'll use the example of lingerie but this can apply to other aspects of life and relationships but this will be the easiest way to explain. It's as if the world acts under the pretense that women don't need any sort of visual stimulation and that the onus is on them to entice their partners. 

I'm sure some degree of male lingerie exists but in general it's massly created for women and the guys just show up as they are, same old story. Sure some guys may put a bit more effort for special occasions, dressing more nicely, a nice cologne, but it's usually something like they put on a button up shirt and followed basic hygiene and feel like that was a legitimate effort, while oftentimes women put more time, effort and money into their appearance and I'm not saying women don't enjoy looking sexy or feeling desired at all, simply that being asked to wear lingerie or feeling like it's something you need to do can be a bit difficult to wrestle with regarding body image and feeling desirable, while the men can just show up as they always do. When you're asked to wear lingerie suddenly you feel like ""oh I don't have enough appeal on my own"" or ""I look okay but I could look better or need to look more desirable for my partner."" Further, things like lingerie are expensive and to expect women to simply buy it is a bit ridiculous, if they do so by their own choice that's great but if it's for your male partner, unless you're willingly doing it as a gift, I think they should be paying for it or minimum paying half. 

I really don't buy into this whole ""men are visual creatures women aren't"" and I do think pornography has heavily influenced this notion with the focus being on women's appearance, but often quite unrealistic and male pleasure oriented. I would love to see more effort on the part of men to look nicer for their women partners especially if they are asking women to put in even more effort than they already do, or to make it a more mutual situation overall. 

I feel such inner turmoil when something like lingerie comes up because part of me loves the idea of wearing it and part of me sees it as frivolous spending, and giving in to unfair societal pressures. Maybe to some degree it's my own self-esteem but in this situation there isn't nearly the same pressure being put on men. I am feeling increasingly bothered by this, one day I'll be looking up lingerie because I feel like I have to follow this expectation and because I genuinely think it's cute, then later I'll feel sick about it because I start feeling like how I am isn't good enough and that my partner gets a free pass no matter what and it's making me feel quite bitter. I have talked to him about this and he's been understanding and simply said it wasn't something that ever crossed his mind which just made me more annoyed in some ways. 

I know many women wear it for themselves and that's fine but if you're doing it for your partner, do you feel there is an imbalance? 
If you already do make extra effort, men, or women if your partner is making more effort on their appearance what kinds of things are being done? Do you feel like it's a very one-sided situation? Have you even thought about this or is it just a norm at this point that women need to be sexy but it doesn't matter so much for men?",1586665706.0

how do you tell a woman that her pussy smells off? when this has happened i didn‚Äôt even notice until i was putting my boxers back on, and it literally wafted into my nostrils. this ofc happened bc i wasn‚Äôt that into these women and thus didn‚Äôt go down on them. they were horny; i was horny, just a quickie type vibe. 

i didn‚Äôt wanna say anything because i know it can be super detrimental for someone to hear an aspect of their body is unenjoyable, but got damn. this smell is seared into the folds of my brain forever. i left without mentioning it and never talked to them again. i washed my cock off so many times in the shower and still didn‚Äôt feel clean (yes i went and got tested after. i was cleannnn!!) 

do women not check themselves to make sure they don‚Äôt have any unusual odor before they invite a guy to fuck them? idk i never have to deal with this usually, but the rare time it‚Äôs happened, it made me want to punch a hole in my wall.

Help/ advice from men and women,6,g2jahy,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/g2jahy/minimum_sex_for_newlyweds_help_advice_from_men/,15,"**(As usual, this is a post asking for help and advice, not an attack post)** I made a post a few months ago asking for help achieving sexual intercourse.  You can read that post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dji71c/want_to_have_sex_but_having_issues_embarrassing/) Since that post, we have had sex about four months ago. Neither party achieved orgasm. It really wasn‚Äôt our goal. Our goal was to try to learn each other‚Äôs bodies and in time that will come with practice. We didn‚Äôt want to make the ""O"" the main goal, I feel like it would make sex too mechanical. Apparently, the issue for achieving P in V was my size. It is larger than average, I guess. 

Well since that time we have *tried to have sex 7 times in the past four months,* but it doesn't last. During foreplay, she almost rushes me through it. When I try cunnilingus she says she enjoys it but then says she wants P in V but when we do P in V she wants to stop. She says it‚Äôs too intense and she is not used to the feeling. FYI, we do not have hard sex or deep sex. I am always trying to be gentle. We may try sex for about 4 mins then stop. 

I think I am concerned about her lack of desire or interest in sex. She says she has a desire, but she will rarely initiate sex. When I initiate, she typically rejects me saying she is too tired or not in the mood. We always cuddle, hold hands, and touch each other but that‚Äôs as far as it goes mostly. I would remind her how beautiful she is and sexy she is to me and she says the same. She said she has sex dreams about us, and she wakes up feeling her heartbeat in her vagina. (I assume this is a wet dream for women). When I ask her about what was it that made the dream great, she can‚Äôt remember, or it is minimum details. I want to know so I can try to fulfill her desires. I never pressure her about having sex or make her feel bad about her lack of drive, but it is driving me crazy. I am horny all the time and it is to the point where I kind of don't want her touching me because I become aroused just to end the night with hidden sexual frustration. I never reject her though. And to make matters worse is we have new neighbors that have insanely loud passionate sex and I can‚Äôt sleep at night. I find myself looking forward to hearing them and wanting what they have. It turns me on and frustrates me at the same time. And I feel this is wrong. 

I am beginning to wonder if there is something wrong with me. I started going back to the gym to get back into serious shape. I used to be insanely fit but since I have been going through grad school and working at the same time, I am more normally fit. I am trying to read and apply books like"" she comes first"" and others. Because what if I am doing something wrong. Has anyone else gone through a similar situation? How did you overcome this.

Ummmm... Yes please!! We've been together for 10+ years so trying something sexual but completely new was a HUGE turn on. I kind of felt like it was the final frontier. One of the last realms of sexual territory that we haven't yet explored together. It's not even like I've really been begging her to do it or anything. I've always felt mildly curious, but never driven or desperate to try it. But it was such a turn on for me for us both to be exploring a part of her body/sexuality that we'd never explored before.

Anyway, we started. We lubed up, I slipped my pointer finger into her ass, and wow was she ever tight. Actually made me a little nervous that if I were to get inside her that she'd crush my cock. Is that a valid concern I wonder? Once when she was in the throes of an orgasm she grabbed my cock with her hand and squeezed it so hard I was in intense pain for several minutes afterwards, so it seems like a valid concern. Anyway, she said the finger didn't hurt (we went slow) and felt interesting and she imagined she might enjoy it once she got a chance to get used to it. 

She asked me to slip in two fingers, but it was so tight, I couldn't see how I could get a second finger in without poking/hurting her. So she said, ""well let's just try to get your cock inside"". We tried, but didn't have any luck. We tried in missionary, tried missionary with her legs up, tried doggy, it didn't fit at all. From my pov I couldn't even tell there was a hole there. There didn't seem to be any penetration, not even the tip. I might as well have been trying to push it into a solid wall based on how it felt. After a couple minutes she said she felt like she'd had enough, and I had no problem with that so we called it good. All in all, I'd say we'd both qualify it as a successful first attempt. 

So. A couple questions.

1. The fingers. There were so many things I could do with my fingers when I was inside her bum. Curl them up and massage the front wall, curl down and massage the back wall, spin it around, push in deeper, slide in and out (""feels like I'm popping"" she said). Obviously every person is different and we'll explore together and she'll tell me what feels good, but until next time we try, what feels good to you? What turns you on? What gives you an orgasm? Any particular tips or tricks that work for you that you could share?

2. It seemed pretty certain my cock was not going in there the way she was last night. If we want to try again should I buy a set of graduated size butt plugs? Is that the best way to prepare yourself?

151,151,The idea of not caring if a partner finishes is so strange. I‚Äôd never thought of it as common until coming here [Meta],854,goxlbz,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/goxlbz/the_idea_of_not_caring_if_a_partner_finishes_is/,135,"When I was in middle school, my mom sat me down to talk about sex. She told me about how sex isn‚Äôt just a utility, it‚Äôs about fun. Not only that, she said that sex should primarily be about fun. Further, she told me that if a partner isn‚Äôt enjoying themselves, it‚Äôs not sex at all. 

I can‚Äôt say that that‚Äôs the right way to be raised as it set unrealistic expectations for me, but it‚Äôs the way it was. When I was in high school, my friends were all fairly sex positive. We talked about sex and orgasms (they were mostly girls) casually, it was even talked about in school. 

Until I joined this subreddit and went to college, I thought that this was the norm. At first, I thought the posts about inattentive partners were outliers, that the majority of people (in particular women) had partners who cared about their pleasure. I mostly ignored them. 

When I went to college, I realized that those posts really reflect the majority of people. I‚Äôve met people here who‚Äôve never had an orgasm with a partner despite having several relationships or many hookups. I met people who‚Äôd never had an orgasm at all because they simply weren‚Äôt taught how. 

It‚Äôs honestly sickening to think about, having lived a life so different in terms of sex than the people I find myself surrounded by now. It hurts my heart to read posts from women in long term relationships whose boyfriends care more about feeling ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù than actually making their partners cum. 

I don‚Äôt really have a question related to this, it‚Äôs more just a vent. I recently saw a post from someone who‚Äôs boyfriend would stop eating her out when she was about to cum and start having penetrative sex. When she asked him to help her finish first, he made comments about how she didn‚Äôt think sex with him was good enough. Knowing that the majority of AFAB folks can‚Äôt cum from just penetration, that sounds so absurd.

I do want to help, I just don‚Äôt know how. This culture of not caring seems so ingrained here that I struggle to talk to friends about it. I also struggle with it because I‚Äôm a cis passing trans guy, when I talk to women about their pleasure it sounds like I‚Äôm a pervert hitting on them.

We‚Äôre parents of two little ones and have always had a decent sex life, but in the past year or so I‚Äôve come to realize just how lopsided the balance is of me initiating sex vs. her. When I can get her in the mood, she has fun, but too often sex needs to be something quick for my benefit only. She‚Äôs never been into too lengthy of a session, but she loves having orgasms and enjoys sex when she‚Äôs into it.

So here we are socially isolating at home, stuck indoors most of the day with our kids, and I‚Äôd be happy having sex twice a day to distract ourselves and get our minds off our stress. For her, a need for sex or orgasms or closeness with me is possibly her lowest priority. Even outside this crisis, it‚Äôs difficult for her to get out of mom mode. There‚Äôs always something to be done whether I‚Äôm helping or not. I don‚Äôt knew how to change that.

From reading this sub over the years, I‚Äôm well aware of women who have talked about libidos and the challenge of getting into sex being different from men. Men are almost always ready to go at an instant; women take some nurturing. 

I just wish that I was a choice my wife made once in a while. I wish I was a need she had - to bond with me, to be assertive about what she wants, to choose to be sexually present, etc. etc.

I would KILL for my wife to pull me into the bedroom and say ‚ÄúI really want you right now.‚Äù I‚Äôd love to hear her say ‚ÄúI was thinking about how good that was the other night, let‚Äôs do that again,‚Äù or ‚Äúlet‚Äôs not watch tv tonight, let‚Äôs get in bed early.‚Äù

So, any women here who were ever like this and found some habits, motivations, new traditions, anything to become more active and assertive in initiating sex with your husbands? What personal changes were helpful? What advice would you give me to help my wife?",1586393194.0

No shit, I even was asked ‚Äûwhat were if you would want sex or were raped?‚Äú ?? What kind of question is this. I think I would know and plan when I would want to have sex, I don‚Äôt take birth control from age 14-20! despite not having sex in these 6 years * I should take birth control because I could be raped? You know that‚Äôs like wearing a raincoat each day because it could maybe rain some day? 
You know it‚Äôs healthier to not take it? I don‚Äôt want to burden my body with even more meds than I already have to take? Let the hormones fool my body into thinking it‚Äôs pregnant for as long as I take birth control? Risking depression which I already have? Risking thrombosis which already happened to a close relative? 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong. If women want to take birth control, they obviously are free to do that, but i personally don‚Äôt want to take it and that shouldn‚Äôt be seen as weird. It should not be taken for granted and seen as ‚Äûnormal‚Äú that women take birth control and let men have their ‚Äûbenefit‚Äú of not having to use a condom or worry about making a baby at cost of their sex partners health. We shouldn‚Äôt pretend that hormonal birth control is completely harmless and without any risks. Some women take the risk for their health but some women don‚Äôt, it should both be seen as normal.
Women are supposed to take birth control pills each day and many men take that for granted?

If I make any mistakes, kindly please correct me. I have no intention of offending anyone.

I am a woman, and I've been really interested in what is commonly referred to as ""trap"" porn (which I believe is a transphobic term, but it's also the easiest search term to use, and I'm not sure what the more appropriate term would be, please let me know if there is one.). Basically, I'm attracted to both men and women, but sexually, I prefer penises. Ive been fantasizing about fucking someone who would be described as a ""hot chick"", who just happens to conveniently have a cock.

I realize that some people use strap ons, but it's not the same for me. I want to be able to pleasure their dick, and I don't really know what to do with vaginas, so it would be one sided.  I'm visually attracted to women, I love breasts, and I love dicks. 

My biggest concern is that it's my impression that people who... I really don't know what the right word is and I don't want to offend anyone... I'm just going to say what I mean in plain English. People who present as female but were born with penises are sensitive about having a penis and don't necessarily want it touched during sex. I could be completely wrong about that, it's a sensitive subject for people. It also seems like they are most often seen in porn receiving anal sex from other men. I know that sexual preferences differ among everyone, but is that the most common?

Basically, I want to fuck a chick with a dick, but I don't want to fetishize them in a way that makes them uncomfortable or make it weird for them. I'm happily married, so I'm not interested in any sort of relationship, just sexual encounters. I'm not sure what the best way to phrase any of this is, and I would just love to have some more information about it and what the best way to go about seeking out that kind of encounter is.",1586595532.0

The human body is a true marvel of mutations and evolution and yet the things a womans body does and can do? The physical stress they can put up with (to clarify, I‚Äôm referring to childbirth but take it as you will, we are in the sex subreddit üòú) just goes to show how powerful you all are.

I hate that some men have given women around the world the mindset that they have to constantly watch their backs in public, but I‚Äôve experienced it myself (my roleplay character is a True Hermaphrodite, but long story short avatar-based chatrooms have no way of differentiating that) and the number of guys (whether intentionally creeping or not) who avoided conveniently seemed to avoid the open-to-all, public general chat and immediately slipping into my ‚ÄúDMs‚Äù,  ‚ÄúWhisper chat‚Äù or simply not accepting that I was rejecting their Friend Request was just absolutely eye opening.

The fact that most women can't orgasm from penetration alone is a common talking point. There are lots of people making a distinction like 'vaginal orgasms are so much more intense than clitoral orgasms they are mind blowingly intense' and there seem to be women out there thinking they are somehow missing out on this because they can't do it. But that must be untrue. 

In my experience of 16 years of masturbation, penetration etc I have bcome completely acquainted with my body, I am an expert on how to bring myself to orgasm and as far as orgasms go I have experienced the most mind blowing Earth shattering orgasms and I know that there is nowhere higher to go in terms of pleasure because I have had it all and this is how my orgasms work.

Strictly clitoral orgasms when I just rub my clit to orgasm are not satisfying to me at all. They are not very intense and leave me feeling like there is something missing, like there should be something inside of me. I never masturbate this way because I stay horny so I will have to do some penetration afterwards to get satisfied anyway. I basically view this as child's play, incomplete, annyoing, the thing I did when I was like 10 and didn't yet know how to masturbate properly.

If I am really physically aroused and a lot of blood rushes down there, I can get sensitive enough that penetration alone feels really good and I can have an orgasm but it's not a satisfying orgasm either, it's more satisfying than a clitoral one because there is something inside me which is very satisfying feeling, but it is never mindblowing, it always leaves me feeling like I should've rubbed my clit as well....

Because the only proper mindblowing orgasm I can have is when I am being penetrated and rubbing my clit at the same time. I usually do penetration and then when I want to cum I start rubbing my clit and I cum in like 30 seconds. THIS is the mindblowing vaginal orgasm that some women don't seem to have, it is triggered by rubbing the clit while being penetrated at the same time.

Now my problem is is that there is all this talk of the 'g-spot' and how that is what causes this mindblowing orgasm but I have seen no evidence of this g spot actually existing, it's just your clitoris being stimulated on the inside while you are being penetrated.... so you don't need to wait to find your g spot while you are being penetrated, you just rub your clit and you have a 'g-spot' orgasm. Its the clit that triggers the orgasm and somehow, I dont understand why physiologically, having somethign thrusting inside you turns this into a vaginal orgasm instead of the lame clitoral one.

So I admit I don't understand why penetration + rubbing clit together makes for the mindblowing 'vaginal' orgasm. Because it is rubbing the clit which actually triggers the orgasm, not the penetration itself (most of the time I am not aroused enough to orgasm strictly from penetration), but there is something that makes the two together produce this effect, which is mysterious, because as I said logically speaking a clitoral orgasm should feel the same whether you are being penetrated while having your clit stimulated or not... but it's not the same, in fact it is radically different. If I have something inside me while rubbing my clit I will have extremely strong contractions, I grip the dildo so hard I can't keep thrusting etc, if I just rub my clit it's just small  contractions.

Why does this 'vaginal' orgasm myth still exist? Are there women who seriously feel the same type of orgasm when rubbing their clit during sex as when they are masturbating just by rubbing their clit?",1588318508.0

My argument is that I don't get a good chance for orgasm when I'm on top, since he usually finishes before me, especially when I am on top, and it doesn't really give me a chance to touch myself either, which is how I usually get there.

I'm used to it now tho I just let the arousal go on since I cant do anything about it, it really works me up tho.  When I sit with my legs crossed it happens too. Anyone else? I want to not have this happen anymore,  help?

2. What are the negatives of doing this versus him doing other things in that exact moment?

This causes the sensations becomes less intense and causes her to have a hard time achieving an orgasm. 

Now my initial thought was, to have a towel handy to wipe her down during the act. However, this causes her to loss the momentum on the build up. Eventually after a few times we will switch to a vibrator to get her off. 

I have been racking my brain since we had the conversation to think of a way to keep things as dry as possible with the use of a towel. But this seems like an impossible task for obvious reasons.

I felt like I was owned. It felt raw and passionate, like, damn, he couldn't help himself because of how hot I was, could he?

I think a lot of people forget about the friends part of fwb. I understand there is a fear you will catch feelings for someone but mutual respect and caring are important for any human relationship. I think a lot of guys don‚Äôt understand how difficult it can be for young women to trust people with their bodies. Society has a habit of repressing women‚Äôs sexual desires at a very young age.

But I've never had an orgasm with a partner. Ever. Never even come (ha!) close. I am worried I've become too reliant on my one method of masturbation - which involves using the weight of my whole body, legs closed tightly, and a lot of pressure - and has ruined any potential orgasms I could be having with a partner.

It's not a transferable method. I have absolutely no problems saying what I like or showing somebody, but they can't do it using the method I do.

I'm in my thirties - orgasming is fucking great. I really want to be able to have somebody else give me one.

I read about the ''prone'' position, which is what I'm doing, and how that can cause problems for the men and women who masturbate in reaching orgasm with a partner.

So I'm looking for as much as advice and help as I can get. Women - if this is how you get yourself off, do you come from sex or oral with a partner too? What's your technique? Am I doomed to have lonely, albeit great, orgasms alone for the rest of my life?

There's a new guy on the scene. He's so generous in bed. He'd go down on me for hours if I let him. I feel like he's the one I can finally get over this problem with, if only I can work out how the fuck to do it!

Background not important but I mentioned to a woman (via a subreddit post) that guys respond to sexual stimuli unconsciously. It's wired in

Of course they nearly always ignore it. And that's when it got messy

""Can't men control themselves?"" 

Of course and they do

And it degenerated from there. Ultimately I was subject to a very derogatory response

But I later realized it was the word ""control""

Possibly she saw it as a conscious effort to not allow the sexual stimuli take over my thoughts and actions

Not at all but later attempts to clarify went unanswered

Somewhere I also used the term arousal and that I realized was worse

I think arousal to her again was conscious and maybe even implied erection

To me it meant a subconscious reaction was triggered. Aroused from its dormant place to something not dormant. Though not necessarily conscious either

Her comments said I was sexist and I need to take responsibility and not put that responsibility on the woman

I'm not sexist. Of course I take responsibility and don't put responsibility on the woman

Normally that is. But in this situation we were discussing it was clear that the sexual activity (which she admitted had male arousal as it's purpose) was not intended for me and therefore I should have no reaction

My attempt at explaining subconscious male ""reaction"" was a failure

Was it my words, or do women not realized such subconscious triggers exist in men? 

I also said some women seem to think men don't notice sexual things until /unless they decide to

The topic that brought this up was somewhat controversial to begin with 

I know I failed to explain. Words like trigger and response and arousal and control painted an ugly picture

How best to describe it? 

Or am I actually wrong in saying men respond subconsciously? 

If anyone responds, would you mind stating your gender and approximate age?

That must mean she likes to be ordered around, shouted at, treated poorly because she'll love it. That's what submissives love don't they? You're mine, you're owned now (two dates in ...). 

If this sounds terrible to you, consider yourself lucky. You're one of the good ones and my friends and I have one too many experiences otherwise. 

I'm so greatful to my partner (and anyone else out there) who doesn't take advantage and emotionally abuse a partner simply because they have a submissive streak. To tie them up and ravish them but then untie them and spend quality time, woo them, go on a date, is important in all parts. Would I love to serve at your feet in just a pair of high heels while you unwind from work? Sure. Does that mean you can yell at me and berate me if I forget something? No. That's abusive, not being a good Dom. 

Just because a girl might want to spend a few hours every few days at your beck and call in bed, doesn't mean you have your own servant all the other times. You still deserve to treat her like an equal.

So here's to those who know and strike this wonderful balance. To treat the same person in one context like a sex toy to be used, but like a queen to be cherished in another while you enjoy a celebratory dinner! That's the beauty of the thoughtful, confident, mature Dom and I salute you.",1590302332.0
216,216,Judgemental attitude about a woman's past/number,2751,fz4649,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/fz4649/judgemental_attitude_about_a_womans_pastnumber/,571,"Rant incoming: I am sick of guys thinking it's ok to judge me based on the fact that I'm not a virgin or that I've dated/slept with more than one guy!


Everytime I go on a date, it's always the same damn inappropriate list of questions: ""So, what did you do with your ex?"", ""How many guys have you been with?"", ""So, how many people have you dated?"" and ""Do you do this a lot?"" (I got asked this last question for being upfront with a guy that I wanted to keep things casual....so much for honesty, huh?).


What's even more off-putting is that the same men who judge me for my past, expect me to satisfy their EVERY sexual demand and need...the same men who expect me to ""take charge""/""be-in-control"".....are also the same ones who want a goody-two-shoes, chaste-virgin with no past :-|


You can't eat your cake and have it too :-|¬†


You can't expect a woman to ""take charge""/satisfy your every sexual whim and fancy....and at the same time, judge her for her past.¬†


Usually, women AND men who are sexually inexperienced, won't be good at ""taking charge"" in the bedroom or even open to sexually satisfying their man's EVERY little sexual fetish, whim and fantasy.... because that comes with experience and time.


What's worse is that most of them just don't give as good as they're demanding. Somehow the foreplay is never/barely reciprocated.


And you know what?¬†


I'm done!


I'm done with the lack of passion, done with the lack of emotional connection, done with the lack of chemistry, done with the lack of foreplay,¬†done with guys who are too focused on their ""performance"",¬†¬†done with partners who can't just be in the moment and enjoy making-out for the sake of making-out, done with partners who expect me to be wet and ready-to-go when they either put in no/barely any effort with foreplay,¬†done with the lack of understanding of how a woman's body works, done with men who expect me to be understanding and patient when they've got issues with maintaining erections and yet can't show an iota of that understanding or patience when I politely tell them that I need a little time to go 'all the way', I'm done with guys who expect a lot in the bedroom and yet can't give the same in return, I'm done with guys whose definition of foreplay is to either roughly shove their dicks and fingers in my vagina or shove a porn film in my face because they don't want to take the time out to learn what I ACTUALLY like on MY terms......but most importantly, I'm done with the judgemental attitude about my past or my ""number"".


I'd rather go the rest of my life NEVER having sex again than sleep with someone who is selfish in bed! I'd rather be on an oath of chastity than sleep with someone who I have no connection to! I'd rather be a nun than sleep with someone who isn't passionate about me!


I'm DONE!¬†


I'm throwing my towel in! I'm throwing the baby, the bathwater...the whole freakin bathroom out!


I'm done :-|

Edit: I understand that people are allowed to have their preferences including preferring to date only virgin-women or women with a very low partner count. 

But what I don't get is sleeping with a woman and then turning around to tell your mates about how ""easy"" she was (behind her back) or continuing to pursue a relationship with the said ""fast"" woman AFTER she has made it clear that a) I'm not a virgin and I do have a ""past"" and b) I want to keep things casual. 

It doesn't make any sense to talk about preferring an inexperienced women to bed/date but yet continuing to pursue a woman who has spelt out to you that she has a ""past"" or has been with more than one guy.

Edit 2: I also get that you need to enforce boundaries with guys as early as possible in order to weed out the judgemental ones. So I agree that some of the guys that I found myself dating were guys that I could have avoided had I just been more stubborn about MY preferences for non-judgemental men.

We're both successful adults in professional careers. We're very affectionate, loving, we go out on dates a lot, we do romantic cuddle nights. We love our pets (no kids yet) and may be bucking the trend of many marriages, we have a shit ton of sex.

Ok, so a shit ton might be exaggerating and humblebragging, but it's at least every day.

So my concerns started 4 months ago, before all these lockdowns, I was with 9 of my girlfriends having cocktails and the topic of sex obviously came up. There were all surprised as hell that I (who's been in a relationship the longest, 7 years married for 3) that our sex life was so active.

They also brought up that I wasn't dressed appropriately for a married woman as I wore a tight cropped tube top and tight pants. They all joked that I was looking to pick up some guy that night, but I blurted out the truth which was, ""no no, my husband picked it out as he likes when I dress all sexy and then he likes to ravage me when I get home"".

This turned from a fun conversation to some in the group thinking I was being sexually abused, groomed, and perved on by my husband. I found this really really odd that grown-ass women would think like this and dismissed it as jealousy.

However, two of them have spoken to me at length and really got into my head saying things like:

1. You'll only have his attention once you maintain your looks, when you grow old or pregnant he's gonna look elsewhere
2. He's sexualizing you too much
3. No man wants his wife to dress up so sexy when he's not around, maybe he's a cuck
4. No normal guy is so obsessed with having his wife look and dress so sexy
5. Something is off with a man who buys lingerie or sexy clothes for his wife every week (not that often but I do have almost 50 sets of lingerie and micro bikinis)
6. He's a pervert because he loves taking nude and sexy pictures of me

The thing is, even though I told them I love this sexual side and I do have a fetish for dressing up hot, they both think it's weird.

I really really don't but I'm not gonna lie they have gotten to me and made me a little concerned.

Who's right here? Should I be worried? Should I bring it up with him? I don't want to discourage this at all as I love sex, I'm very HL and I love how he adores me sexually.

I've had one experience with a MFM spit-roast and it was AMAZING for me, one of the guys.  The woman was really into it and it was like she didn't want it to end.

I've seen a similar reaction in amateur porn (Yes, porn isn't a true reflection of sex - but sometimes situations are indeed real) where the woman in the middle just seems to get into a groove that is insanely hot.  I've seen a few scenes where the woman easily goes 30-40 minutes and shows no sign of slowing down, it's the guys that tap out.

I love the idea of a woman getting lost in pleasure and finding some kind of feedback loop that spurs the guys on to keep giving her something she's clearly loving.

Women who really enjoy being spit-roasted - what's it like?  How to best help you find that groove and enjoy it as long and as much as possible?  What gets you into that space and what takes you out of it?

I actually am the opposite. I'm very sweet and humble, and sexually speaking, I love being dominated. 

I love when sex is not about what I want, but about what *she wants*.

I love the feeling of being with a woman that I consider, let's say : smarter, wealthier, in better shape and more able than me. I'd love her to respectfuly use me for sex. In everyday life, I don't really care about those things. I guess the girl I'd love could be gentle or not-so-gentle, quiet or not-so-quiet ; who cares. In bed, I'd love it a little spicier.

I know that submission can be achieved in different ways. Her taking things in hands ? Pain ? Humiliation ? As I've never experienced it, I can't say what I'd exactly enjoy, for the simple reason that all of the women I've been with searched for rather dominant men.

So the case is that I a (17M) (legal in Europe) and my (17F) girlfriend are having trouble with contraception. For me condoms are very faulty and unreliable and I have a bad history with them and want to avoid them at all times. My gf understands that as we were both each others firsts and went through all the misshaps together.

We want the best option and I'm writing this in both of our names since she doesn't use Reddit. I'm aware of how to use condoms and how to use them effectively but they simply have proven faulty in the way we play. I'm not aware of any kind of effective contraception for men that isn't like a condom or castration but if you know of anything that might be new or controversial please do mention it.

Thanks alot and good luck in these unsettling times.",1586074511.0
237,237,Has anyone here ever tried those women enhancement pills (like from the gas station or convenience store)? Did they help/do anything?,4,focq4i,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/focq4i/has_anyone_here_ever_tried_those_women/,23,"Hi! 21F here and I have a probably stupid question. 

I‚Äôve posted on here before because I can‚Äôt get aroused and if I can manage to get aroused I‚Äôm not wet and I can‚Äôt penetrate myself with anything, not even able to use a tampon. 

I was wondering-have any of you on here tried those dumb women pills from the gas station that are supposed to ‚Äúenhance‚Äù sexual experiences? I‚Äôm wondering because maybe they will help me get aroused easier and maybe even make penetration a much easier experience. 

Also, if you have taken them, how did it go? Did they work? Do you think they‚Äôd help some of my sexual issues?",1585111247.0

I hate it when I'm excited and go down and there's just a bit of musty smell and other displeasing odors. A total turn off. And then they're surprised that they're not getting as much action as before? 

Well, before, your were so much more diligent. Now that the relationship is getting steady, you're slacking off pal.

55,55,Why Delhi violence is a 'pogrom'.. A powerful rebuttal of the 'both sides' argument peddled by liberals. Courtesy of Kavita Krishnan on Twitter.,144,ffsgpv,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffsgpv/why_delhi_violence_is_a_pogrom_a_powerful/,22,"A ‚Ä™thread‚Ä¨ on whether it's wrong to call Delhi violence a pogrom‚Ä¨. 

I request liberal friends, journalists, citizens, to please read with patience. I'm not looking to label, ridicule, but to clarify. Making this point at Young India Rises‚Ä¨ March for peace, justice, democracy. 

So, it's a FACT that Muslims and Hindus have been killed in the violence. Every drop of blood shed, every life lost, is equally precious - and it is the Home Minister Amit Shah & Narendra Modi who have that every drop of blood on THEIR hands, on the hands of Delhi Police.

Were you tempted to say there are ""two sides""? Be honest, many feel this way. 

But the thing to note is that only ONE side had the Delhi Police, the State machinery on its side. Only ONE side could hear Court say that ""it's not the right time to file an FIR"".

Only ONE side could have police break CCTV to protect them, have a judge sent packing because he ordered arrest of its ringleaders. So even if you think there are 2 sides, you've to see the 2 sides are NOT EQUAL. 

ONE has the entire state machinery on its side, & enjoys full impunity.

And that's the very definition of a pogrom, of state sponsored targeted genocide -  State backed killing of members of a particular ethnic, religious, or ideological group is a pogrom. To say #DelhiPogrom2020 or #DelhiGenocide2020 isn't to say the Hindu victims don't count!

When we say #MuslimLivesMatter we don't mean Hindu lives matter less. Instead we are pointing out that for the Delhi Police and their bosses, Muslim lives are like ""termites"". The Delhi Police did not kick Hindu victims in the gut asking them to sing the anthem.

It's important not to seek a ""perfect victim"". Muslims are overwhelmingly the victims of  STATE SPONSORED hate and violence, even if some Hindus are also victims of violence (by some Muslims)

So finally: we've to demand accountability from the PM and HM. They're the ‡§∞‡§π‡§¨‡§∞ ‡§è ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§≤‡•ç‡§ï (Leaders of the nation) - Ask them to meet our eyes and tell us, whose blood is this, of every victim, that you have on your hands.

To rephrase this: There are victims on both sides. Every victim's blood is on this Govt. But the perpetrators were not two evenly matched sides. The police, state machinery, even court, Govt all openly or tacitly abetted only the targeted anti Muslim violence.",1583777330.0

111,111,Thoughts on police violence during lock down,0,fp68uu,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fp68uu/thoughts_on_police_violence_during_lock_down/,16,"There have been several reports and videos and reddit posts about police being violent to impose the lock down, and there are a lot of people complaining about it, obviously. And that is natural, since most of those people seem to be the kind that have never experienced curfew-like situations in their lives. Here are some thoughts that try to put the situation in context.

This is the first time in India that curfew-like orders have been imposed nationwide in a non-violent environment. The lock down is not to prevent riots or looting and things like that, but rather, to prevent the transmission of a highly contagious disease for which there is no cure.

This order has always been enforced by the police, and the enforcement therefore depends on how the police on the ground interprets the order.

Since the threat is not that of violence, police won't be out in full force with guns. Instead, they would have non-lethal weapons, like lathis.

Citing police violence is quite easy to do, but we all know how the public behaves too. You see one person jumping a traffic signal, and usually, several others follow. That applies to pretty much any and all rules in our country, because somehow, it seems to me that Indians just hate following rules that are personally inconvenient to them. And the sheer number of people breaking the rules makes it impossible for the police to actually stop them all (whether to challan or to take bribe is a different story).

Since this is a drastic situation, maybe the police is using violence against some to deter others who might be considering this as an especially good time to go out. There are many such people, obviously, like those who went to Goa over the weekend and are now fucked, or those who have been finding pleasure in driving on the empty streets, or those who are just generally considering this a holiday and can't tolerate being indoors for too long.

Police are also humans, they have their own families to take care of too, and given the nature of their jobs, they are also at higher risk than the average person. That could make them more on the edge than they would usually be.

By all means, berate the police for violence against civilians. But also see where the police is coming from. Our support and cooperation with them would make this current crisis easier to deal with. And not all police personnel are like that, there are also videos of cops doing good deeds or being super polite, like that cop (in Tamil Nadu somewhere, I think) folding his hands and requesting people to stay in. And also, equating police violence with some sort of a secret dictatorial agenda by the prime minister or his obnoxious, fat sidekick is just so stupid that I won't even bother addressing that.

There, rant over.",1585230744.0

Based on what he said, he was not an Indian but most likely a Person of Indian Origin, possibly an immigrant, and in his own words, he ""work[s] a high powered job in [X]"", with dual citizenship of countries X and Y.

He thinks people my and college-student aged are stupid people, even though he's also under 30 (and barely older than I am).

There was an exchange of words, and to the best of my knowledge, I did not hurl expletives at him, although I obviously was a little snarky. I mean, he was calling me a ""stupid child"", that he'd ""slap [me] across the face and [I'd] walk straight"" and that he'd ""love to visit India and break some legs of protestors like [me]"". A really mature way of talking for someone who was trying to show off his qualifications.

Apparently by protesting the CAA, a ""dumb ass Indian faggot"" like me was preventing ""[his religiously affiliated brothers and sisters]... from gaining safety in India"". That he was ""glad"" that muslims were excluded, because they could go to Pakistan. Apparently he wasn't a proponent of the theory that most Indian Muslims rejected partition along religious lines and supported mutually inclusive Indian secularism.

Apparently, with my ""[low] IQ"", and quite obviously in deep contrast to his high IQ given his job, the CAA would survive as long as overseas Indians continue to support the CAA and NRC.

Why am I posting this now? Well, I have never faced actual threats of violence online before. I needed some time to process my thoughts. Thankfully it was only one person who felt the need to attack me directly. 

In hindsight, I do think that I should have engaged him in a better way than I did at the time. But he had closed off his mind anyway, and wouldn't let me say why was opposed to the CAA, because apparently in my answer, which to me is connected to the NRC, I was ""diverting"" from the issue at hand by going off on ""tangents"".

Apparently he perceived a ""superiority complex"" in my previous post, and felt the need to challenge it (with threats and abuse), when it is an indisputable fact that the most vocal ""unkill""-aged supporters of the CAA believe the vedas and the shastras (and a few other books) to be the last word on Indian values, in complete dissonance with the reality of India's religious pluralism, and that western culture is shit. I am very certain that many of you have interacted with exactly the kind of people I am talking about.

Well, Mr. ""High Powered Job Worker with Multiple Citizenships"", I hope that if I ever meet you in real life, you will have broadened your perspective by then, and moved on from breaking the legs of people who disagree with you. That, and opposition to a law does not mean supporting the strawman.

Just so that you can read it clearly, **I still oppose the CAA and your threats will do nothing to stop me.**

PS - One thing worries me though, is his accusation that the moderators of this sub delete any threads in support of the CAA. Now given that he had no posts in support of the CAA in his account, I don't actually believe him. I did find a lot of racism and feelings of racial insecurity/perceived discrimination complex though. However, I want to, in completely unequivocal terms, *encourage* the supporters of the CAA, for whatever reason, to make their voices heard.

If you don't hurl abuses and construct well-written arguments, I am sure you will be able to engage more constructively with those of us who oppose these measures.",1579484779.0

158,158,Advice and a Word of Caution for Indians thinking About the Student Route to Immigrate to Canada,730,gkam3g,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gkam3g/advice_and_a_word_of_caution_for_indians_thinking/,196,"I recently saw a popular post on immigration strategies that listed Canada as the easiest country to migrate too. I want to provide some more context to this ""very easy"" strategy. My goal is not to discourage anyone from immigrating but to provide awareness of the challenges most commonly faced by Indians that the student route to obtaining permanent residency status in Canada.

**Context**

College and university in Canada are two very different things. Colleges offer diplomas, certificates, and maybe some 3 year degrees. Universities offer 4 years degrees (BA, BSc. etc.) and Masters/PhD/Medical/Law etc. programs. In Canada colleges are popular with people already in the workforce, university graduates looking for specific skill certifications, and people looking to enter non-office jobs. Until recently most international students in Canada enrolled in universities not colleges. But recent changes have opened up a new route of enrolling is college diploma programs where upon graduation they hope to fulfill the requirement of 1 year work in Canada (any field) after which they can apply for permanent residency.

This has led to a huge increase in international students from India. Up until the early 2010s India, China, and Philippines all sent around ~30,000 immigrants to Canada a year. Now China and the Philippines remain at ~30,000 while India has shot up to ~85,000. This boom has had implications potential Indian students should be aware of which I will now discuss.

**The Trap Some Indian Students Enter**

Canada is a great country, no doubt. But when it comes to living here there are some challenges. Those challenges are...

1. Limited Job Market: it's a small country, very spread out
2. Competitive Job Market: huge number of recent immigrants + a decline in some sectors like oil means competition for any type of job even low-pay ones can be surprisingly strong
3. Expensive housing: Cities like Toronto and Vancouver are extremely expensive, small towns and cities are cheaper, but the job market is worse. Also the influx in students mean many areas surrounding colleges are now expensive due to high demand. 
4. The lack of recognition for Indian education or experience: Unfortunately Indian education is not respected here, and I've seen Indians with Masters degrees and job experience have to enroll in bachelor programs all over again. Only exception is if you've experience with a multi-national company, one that the typical Canadian will have heard of. The doctor driving a taxi stereotype is not a joke, it's extremely common.

Unfortunately many students do not fully understand the situation they are entering. So they enter the following trap.

1. Your family takes on expensive loans or sells property to send you to Canada to do your education
2. You enroll in a diploma course from a small college somewhere that has limited value and recognition
3. You graduate and enter Canada's very competitive job market and find white collar jobs are next to impossible to land, and you must settle for blue collar ones (trucking, factory, fast food, drivers and delivery men, women may also do maid/elder care jobs). An article on Canadian factories that hire only immigrants and how they're treated. https://projects.thestar.com/temp-employment-agencies/ 
4. Because your parents spent so much money to send you here you cannot just come back, but you find yourself stuck at the bottom of the ladder. Living costs are high and there may be an expectation to send money home so saving money is a challenge too.

Now of course every student comes thinking they will make it, and they will work as hard as it takes. Which is great, but most of the students trapped in what I just described thought that way too. You may also say low wage work in Canada is still better than India. Possibly, but it's definitely not an easy life when you spend every day working at multiple low wage jobs just to make ends meet. I've heard some say if they worked this intensely in India they could've probably ended up somewhere better. 

For Canadian colleges these students pay much higher tuition than domestic students so they bring in a lot of additional revenue for the country, further more Canada has fewer young people and university is becoming more popular than college. Many colleges have no been recruiting Indian students just for the higher tuition they pay, so they can survive and avoid declining enrollment.

**Backlash**

Furthermore the enormous sudden influx of Indian students has created some backlash. In small towns these students can overwhelm the local job market competing with the local working class population, and making the limited job pool even more competitive. 

In cities the students usually settle in older Indian neighborhoods home to pre-2010 immigrants and Canadian born Indians (who are called Indian-Canadians). Here too job competition increases and the result is the older Indian community has also become hostile against Indian students. Several articles in Canadian and Indian media have described the tension between Indian-Canadians and Indian students. This often combines with accusations of crime and deviancy. Here is one article: https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/douglas-todd-indo-canadians-in-uproar-over-surge-of-foreign-students/

The good news is even with this Canada is extremely friendly to Indians and things like violence against immigrants is ultra-rare.

**COVID-19**

COVID-19 has resulted in millions of jobs lost, the worst Canada has seen in 100 years. If the job market was competitive before it will be ultra-competitive for the future and international students will find themselves at the bottom of the hiring process. Here's an article: https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2020/05/08/they-hoped-for-jobs-and-to-immigrate-to-canada-for-international-students-the-pandemic-has-dimmed-that-hope.html

This situation will take at minimum 5 years to rectify, especially when you consider how many businesses have shut down permanently and how many Canadians who have never been unemployed before are now desperately looking for work.

**Advice for Potential Students**

1. **Consider a graduate program from a University**: The college route is the fastest and simplest but also leaves you with the least valuable certification. In a country where even domestic MBAs spend 2-3 years looking for a good position a business diploma from a small college no one has heard of will not impress anybody. Maybe your fine doing blue collar jobs instead of an office job, okay but remember COVID-19 created 2.5 million unemployed Canadians who you will now compete with in addition to thousands of fellow students. Doing a degree in India, from a reputed school, and then doing a Masters in Canada is the best route for securing good employment. It might take a few years but it's a better chance of success. In Canada job experience is highly valued so select Masters programs that include mandatory internships or co-op place mats. It will give you the Canadian experience that can be so hard to get for immigrants. PS. Cheating is hard in Canada, and professors have little sympathy for sob stories about how you need to pass because you can't go back to India empty handed. As more cases come to light schools are cracking down, and the press is harming the reputation of hard working students. https://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/news-story/9615483-they-passed-the-admissions-test-but-they-were-failing-in-class-how-niagara-college-tackled-an-international-student-crisis/

2. **Maybe hold off on Coming Here till a few Years After COVID-19**: The job market in India has been hit by COVID-19 sparking interest in going abroad, but recognize the job market in Canada is pretty awful right now too. No sense in dropping huge sums to end up in a foreign country unemployed, or just barely scrapping by on a low wage job with no security.

3. **Job Prep from Day 1**: Look out for any opportunities for internships, job training, certificates programs from day 1. Don't think of this as something to worry about after graduation. In many cases this can be the difference between success and failure. I've seen several Indian student spend their student years not especially focused and then spend 3 years after graduation working 14 hours a day working 3 different retail jobs.

4. **Network Outside the Indian Student Community**: The broader your network the more unique opportunities pop up. It can be a challenged, cultural barriers exist and it can be much easier to settle in a friend circle of fellow Indian students. There's also the challenge that some Canadians and Indian-Canadians look down on immigrants. But if you make an effort you will find new friends.

5. **Avoid Crime**: Goes without saying, but increasingly a few students have entered illegal sectors like drug trade our of desperation or frustration. Sooner or later this will end very badly for you, and increasingly incidents like this have resulted in some landlords refusing to rent to male Indians students in some small towns on the USA/Canada border. One example, some Indian students got into a drunk public fight over a petty issue. Someone recorded it and it went viral, police identified them and they were deported. Imagine your parents selling their land to send you to Canada and you got sent back because you got in a fight over something useless. Furthermore, such incidents have drawn negative attention to Indians and Indian neighborhoods. This may come as a surprise to many Indians who often believe their own hype and think the whole world thinks of Indians as a much of super smart hard workers. See this story on how Canada's largest Indian majority region now deals with the reputation of being a ghetto. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/brampton-a-story-of-political-importance-power-and-ethnic-enclaves/article30273820/

6. **Don't Trust Someone Just Because They're Your Community**: When you're in a foreign country it can be exciting and comforting to meet people from your state, district, caste, religion etc. But many times Indian students find themselves being cheated or abused by employers who come from their very community. So exercise caution, learn your rights, and don't put blind faith in an employer or new friend just because you've similar backgrounds. Thanks u/lovefun8in for bringing this up.

Of course this is not to say every Indian in Canada fails. There is a huge middle class community Indian community in Canada and Indian professionals are found in every field. This caution is more to avoid you making common mistakes then to say just don't come here. Remember, getting in to the country is not the end it's the very first step.",1589583416.0

1,1,Domestic Violence,55,eulz4f,Nepal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/eulz4f/domestic_violence/,24,"  

Just a few weeks ago when my father came home very drunk he badly beat up my mother when she refused to listen to his drunken discussions. I was sleeping in my room when I suddenly heard shouting and banging noises from upstairs so I headed upstairs to see that my father had punched my mother on her face and she was bleeding by the time I went upstairs blood was dripping down her face and badly swollen on the left side of her face. My mother was wiping her face and my sister was crying besides her as for my father as soon as I saw that scene I asked why did you do this? What did you do to my mother? He said that she didn‚Äôt agree to listen to me and she was trying to push me away when what she really was doing was she was trying to defend herself from my father.

I froze when I saw my mother and my sister crying and yelling to call someone I didn‚Äôt know who should I call so the first thing I did was dial 100 and call the police to come quickly. When the police arrived my father said to the police that it was just a small argument nothing has happened blah blah blah basically telling that it wasn't his mistake and he did it because my mother was not listening to him and was doing things he didn‚Äôt agree. I found out that my father was telling her to take early retirement and stay at home to do housework. After many discussions with the police, they finally took him to the police station they put him in jail overnight and my relatives and I took my mother to the hospital she got treated and next morning my father said that he didn‚Äôt even remember what he did the night before and didn‚Äôt even admit his mistake. At the police station, they made an agreement paper saying that if my father again repeats this behavior again then he will be charged legally. 

My main concern is if my father doesn‚Äôt even regret his wrongdoings acts as if it was not his mistake to do what he has done. How can we live together as a family? Should we separate from him?",1580148259.0

I am a pragmatic pacifist (if that even makes sense). The cost of war and violence is so substantial that it cannot be morally right by any justification. What's the value of millions of lives? That is why, I don't want to take up arms. That's why this whole situation of war mongering (between Nepal and India) and fears (on social media and traditional media) of an all out war has got me paranoid. 

As far as I understand, the Pundits from the TV shows will not take up arms (cause they are old), the politicians will not take up arms (cause they are old), the rich will not take up arms and neither will the powerful. So, it leaves the youth and the vulnerable. As a youth, I do not want to be in that space. I wish to write my own destiny and this war mongering is kind of ruining my vibe. I just want to talk about shit, do some business, smoke some legal weed and chill. 

I even know what my role is going to be, given my educational history (it's a technical vocation). The impact of my role will be devastating and it will be cruel towards me, if I am to be pushed to that situation. The worst part is, I won't have a choice and I think there are many individuals who have a similar mindset to me. These people will be forced to do horrible things to survive.

History has taught us many things, one of those things is that Nepal cannot be conquered at least in the traditional sense. This is because of the fierce reputation our ancestors built based on the carnage they could show on the battlefield. I think similar mentality of carnage has subconsciously channeled into a positive stream for me (positive stream being my career). But I also know the dangers of it reverting to the battlefield. What scares me is that I might lose respect for a human life just because we would be wearing different colored uniforms....

And I haven't even contemplated my own mortality during this thought process. I am not going to even open that door.

I am not alone in this I think. We are stuck in a rock and a hard place. Given the geopolitical scenario, most Nepali folks with a similar upbringing might feel the same way. Maybe? Maybe not?  I don't know, I just want us to not go into that situation, because if we do, I will be duty bound to do what's needed and I might not like who I become. 

Sigh! For the first time in my life, I feel like my destiny is not in my hands.....",1590032352.0

Now, country is more corrupted, things are on crisis.... And government is on way to establish authoritarianism on some aspects... Foundation of Republic is corrupted and republic came tp be in bad shape...

If you look back the people's movement, the civil war brought stability to the brink, cause it was right thing to do. For nation, for people, against tyranny, feudalism, oligarchs. Didn't we fight for our voice, equality and new phase...

Everybody tells me.. The land was sold.. Long time ago.. When i ask? Not on a period of Mahendra, Who build settlement at border to protect it... Not on period of birendra who is described as "" not so political"" standard. Maybe his brother, who i described to be a part of same cursed foundation of republic

I wanna imagine stable nepal on it's own sovereignty. Not as the stable state of india. I don't wanna imagine the indian flag on maitighar... And singha durbar as CM office. Maybe whole nation will be divided to be part of uttarakhand, up or bihar..

Whole war ended, whole nation celebrated the sovereignty, freedom, dream where every proud men are eligibile to become the head of the state, government. But system is corrupted since the first men of republic, investing on election, buying the votes we call it. And at top, we created a cycle of money by recovering it...and again investing... On themselves, their family... Cycle became larger larger corrupting the authorities, Police, courts, CIAA

To keep money running in cycle... Some money were inforced donation, privatization, corruptions, formation of new oligarchs.. Which started their own cycle.. Where every men became equal.. They became modern barons and lords. And came selling of nalapni... To keep cycle running..enclosing every high table of nation.

Story brought me to Ukraine, The Ukrainian insurgency army fighting at doblass war and its on going... UIA composed those men who showed up at orange protest and euro-maidan protest... Against viktor yanukovych AND against corruption.
Maybe sometimes VIOLENCE is  the real revolution....

But we are tired of just fighting again... If we fight against corruption peacefully.. We know we won't be heard..its just another nirmala incident. We go violent, we still haven't recovered a civil war yet... and If we fight against india voluntarily. We know GOVERNMENT are not going to support us on Frontline... If things go to UN. Court.. We must not forget ISRAEL RULE AGAINST PALESTINE.. No matter what, The big power always win...

These mental health conditions can be linked to, or caused by, hostility or rejection from family parents and friends, bullying and name-calling at school, danger of violence, casual homophobia and negative portrayal of gay people in the media.

Sex education classes should be given after completing kindergarten as the earlier we can combat homophobia the better.
If we can teach schoolchildren that its nothing wrong with being gay or trans at a young age, we can prevent them from being homophobic or heterosexual.

Since there are more than 50 genders now (http://thepbhscloset.weebly.com/a-list-of-genders--sexualities-and-their-definitions.html) we should have schools do surveys on which spectrum of genders does their students feel they are on. There should also be a choice for trans students to freely choose whichever male or female toilet they can use.

We can prevent homophobia, discrimination and prejudice developing if we catch it early enough. This is why it‚Äôs vital to start educating children at primary and junior age, teaching them about equality and diversity, and introducing equality lessons which cover LGBT+ themes in an age appropriate way.

People desperately want to believe in someone, in something. They want to have a messiah who solves all their problem. The continuous bombardment of negative news by the newspapers and the mainstream medias has led them subconsciously to believe that a full scale violence is taking place in the country. It of course is true to an extent but people are uneducated and ignorant enough not to be able to discern exaggerations from truth. With several ups and downs, they finally got a hero, a hero who shouts at people, shames people in-front of millions of people. That hero, sucked up all their trusts and spat hope all over Nepal. 
People have invested their time and energy to form a concrete belief that he is the one, he will save us from everything. Now that he is accused of doing something wrong, they're going haywire. Seems like people love their beliefs more than they love their lives. And I guess due to the same reason, babajis and priests gain an upper hand in religious countries. They provide a hope, a hope of afterlife, a hope of eternal happiness and in return people shed all their hopes in that person who, as we have already seen a couple of times in india, turns out to be a rapist and sex addict. (Mind you, I am not calling Lamichhane a sex addict or something of that kind). But India had a powerful government, they had enough proofs to put the babaji inside the bars. So, regardless of whatever the baba's followers tried to pull off, they were outnumbered and supressed by the government in favour of the truth. 

I have nothing further to say about ignorant and dumb fucking blind followers, they can go fuck themselves. And I really hope lamichhane fucks up somehow and people hear it from their messiah himself that he fucked up, that he did what he was accused of. I want to witness shattered hopes and crumbled faiths. Even if lamichhane comes up and accepts his faults, I guess people will still disbelieve that he did such deeds, they will find a way around, ""RABI JIU LE ESTO GARNAI SAKNU HUNNA, WAAHA LAI SARKAAR LE DHAMKI DIYERA ESTO BHANNU VAKO HO"" or ""RABI JIU LE KEHI RAMRO KAARAN VAYERAI TYO PATRAKAAR LAI TESTO GARNU VAKO HO, WAAHA KO TYO PATRAKAAR LAI MAARNE KUNAI ICHHYA THENA.""

I digged a bit in around the matter and all I could find out was that the 1st associates could *probably* have been the maoist party when they lined up for their 1st Sambidhan Sabha Election through contacts from the indian Congress who have publicly accepted using Cambridge Analytica's help. 
And the data company has on-record said that their strategies in developing countries was always targeting neutral and 1st time voters through the use of media like Radio and TVC where they would play songs, run interviews and documentaries produced explicitly to favor their candidates and hurt other's campaign. I wasn't an eligible voter (wasn't old enough) back then, but I 100% remember our media playing unpopular revolutionary songs, playing old footages of how police used violence to supress people all day long and basically why the king should go and a new power should come. Could it have been Cambridge Analytica's mastermind? Could they have pulled off a trick in our 1st Sambidhan Sabha election?
Now if some of you think less of Cambridge Analytica and know it only since the Facebook data scandal, please note that they actively influenced Modi's surprise 2014 victory (basically changed sides from working for Congress during the last indian election to BJP) and are proud of it.

From what it seems, this kid is their only child, so he is their *pulpulyako chhoro*. That kid cries and scolds others in the smallest of things if he doesn't get what he wants. Yeah yeah, I know what you're saying -  he is just a kid. I understand, but he even swears. Like maaa chi#&#, ran0!, and what not.  
&nbsp;  
It seems the culprit is the father. He is a security guard coz he wears like army pants and uniforms like that. If the kid does not get what he wants, he instantly yells ""Baabaa, yesle malai (blah blah)"". Every. Damn. Time. And the father, instead of explaining things to the kid, scolds whoever the third person is. One time that kid was throwing stones at our window. I get up and tell him not to do it. I did not scold him 'coz I already knew what he would say. Expectedly, that kid yells, ""Baaaba, hernu na malai euta dai le k-k k-k bhanchha!"". He stopped throwing stones and I shrugged him off.  
&nbsp;  
In other words, that little kid is a definition of pulpulyako chhoro. Now today morning, his mother was trying to cut his nail. The kid, being him, misbehaved, so the mother was trying to keep him in line. Now the father comes out and asks, ""K bhayo? kina roko ta?"". And that kid goes, ""malai pitchha mammi le"". I watch in shock as the father replies to him, ""Ani ta pitna sakdainas?"". That kid then goes batshit crazy and starts beating his mom, pulling her hair, scratching her, while the father just goes back inside. The mother does nothing and takes it all in.  
&nbsp;  
I live in my own house (well, my dad's), and they live in rent next door. My room's window is just next to their verandah, so I hear them all the time. And they are one of the noisiest/dirtiest people ever. One time the mother was doing the dishes, and that kid just came up to her and started urinating there. The mother did nothing. I was shocked! It seems the father is the main culprit because he swears all the time and does not discipline the kid. The kid has his father's back for whatever he can get away with (literally anything) and is already scolding/beating his mother/aunt/whoever disagrees with him. ""Baaba, malai yesle aja chocolate nai kindena!"". Yesterday, the father gave an earful to the mother who was trying to make that kid eat his khaana and was late for school. Screaming, crying, and shouting (mostly from the kid) is a 24-hour routine here, and I am sick of it. I have already once told the mother to keep the halla low, but I know it isn't her fault. The father is one hell of a jango and I don't want to risk fight with him by calling out on his kid. I would look like an asshole who doesn't understand kids, and I definitely don't want to lecture him on why he swears in front of his kids. So, any advice on how I can hint them on their behavior?

&#x200B;

Today a ""psycho"" guy beat me up without any reasons. I kept calm and  didn't return the beating because else I would also have been in  trouble.I was seated in a micro bus, in a seat with capacity 3  persons. I was in the middle. The guy was at the corner (near window  side).

The guy did a small fist at my head because (from his perspective) I  was pushing him in the seat. For fuck sake! That seat is like that -  congested and claustrophobic. I have noted down the micro's number plate.  Someone, tell me what should I do? Should I report him?

While taking off, I told that guy ""now you can sit properly"". And then  that guy got fired and beat me up, strangling my neck. Nepalese are all  fuckers. All other passengers didn't bat an eye and told me to leave the  micro bus.

Remember, the seat is always like that. I wasn't pushing anyone around.  Just some shoulder movement to adjust to the seat and micro's tremors.

Now people, someone tell me what should I do?

I didn't return the punches because (as always) I had been humble to the  guy (addressing him as ""tapai"") and partly because my parents are out  of town and my sister is in home; I didn't want any ""police"" dragging  in.

The guy might live in Nakhipot area. I haven't properly noticed his face  because everything happened in an instance. Right now I am in office  and trying to think of ways to put this to an end...

That ""fucker"" didn't think properly. I could have returned the punches  but I didn't want any troubles. Also, all the passengers were ""fuckers"".  The driver didn't stop the vehicle. Nobody gave a concern.

We Nepalese (including me) are shit. The society doesn't give a fuck to strangers and these type of events...

&#x200B;

Can this post be helpful to confront the incident?

PS: I am a normal guy without any past records of violence.

PPS: Sorry (I don't care) about the ""informal"" language here in the post.

Edit 1:

I am thankful for all the replies and discussion in this thread. I was pissed off for few hours. Now, I am calmed down. Being a blogger, I am definitely doing something about this incident from my own ""uncanny"" world. I will definitely give updates if anything comes up regarding this incident.

Edit 2:

Seems like these type of events are incurred every here and there. All we can do is whine and look back at how ""helpless"" we were. Most of the comments point out for retaliation. But, everything happens instantaneously in such instant that nobody has calm mind to think and retaliate (retaliation might be physical, verbal, mental).",1545829878.0

Neupane et al. BMJ Open. 2018

&#x200B;

## Abstract

**Objectives** To explore the prevalence, perpetrator characteristics and the correlates of child abuse in Kathmandu, Nepal.

**Methods** For this cross-sectional study, we translated the internationally validated questionnaire developed by the International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, Child Abuse Screening Tool-Child Home into Nepali. We added questions on descriptive information about students and their family to the questionnaire. We recruited students from 20 schools selected randomly‚Äî2 from each of the 10 electoral constituencies of Kathmandu district. In each school, we administered the questionnaires to the students in a classroom selected randomly. To assess the correlates, we ran multilevel multivariable logistic regression models, stratified by schools.

**Results** Among the 962 students, 88.88% had experience of at least one form of abuse throughout their lifetime. Psychological abuse was the most prevalent form of abuse (previous year: 75.19%; lifetime: 76.15%) followed by physical abuse, exposure to violence, neglect and sexual abuse. Adults were the most common perpetrators of child abuse (37.55%). The correlates identified in this study mostly aligned with the global literature on correlates of abuse. Female students were more likely to report neglect (previous year: adjusted OR (AOR) 1.50, 95%‚ÄâCI 1.10 to 2.04; lifetime: AOR 1.49, 95%‚ÄâCI 1.10 to 2.02), but no gender difference was observed with other forms of abuse. Students living with a single parent had a greater likelihood of exposure to violence (previous year: AOR 2.55, 95%‚ÄâCI 1.31 to 4.94; lifetime: AOR 2.77, 95%‚ÄâCI 1.39 to 5.53), neglect (previous year: AOR 2.01, 95%‚ÄâCI 1.10 to 3.69; lifetime: AOR 2.08, 95%‚ÄâCI 1.14 to 3.81) and sexual abuse (previous year: AOR 3.03, 95%‚ÄâCI 1.45 to 6.37; lifetime: AOR 2.49, 95%‚ÄâCI 1.21 to 5.14).

**Conclusions** Over 88% of students reported experiencing child abuse in the home in one or more forms throughout their lifetime. Delineating the reasons for the high burden and its implications are important topics for future research.

24,24,Something terrifying happened to me few hours ago. I can't sleep.,26,91bj65,Nepal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/91bj65/something_terrifying_happened_to_me_few_hours_ago/,67,"My maiju just arrived from village and called me to come to mama house to take some vegetables she bought from her village. I checked my time, it was 11:45 O'clock at night. Because I have a long day work tomorrow, I took my old bajaj scooter and started driving towards my mama house instantly. 

I was taking shortcuts through the dark galli's with no street lights. 10 minutes into the ride, far away I saw a teenage girl in full black gown waving her hands towards me. I had no options to avoid her but to cross her path to take the Jholunge pul. I didn't stop, but I drove by slowly and glanced at her face for a second.  She looked Newari in caste. I heard her saying something but couldn't figure out what it was. She was wearing a full black gown with heavy makeup, and her hair was wet and loose with water still dripping all over her shoulders and gown. I made my way to the Jholunge pul only to find the pul closed because of construction. I turned back to take a different route.  

Few meters away from the pul, my engine stopped all of a sudden. I started cursing and got out of my scooter to kick start it. When my engine started to run again, the headlight turned on and flashed directly on the teenage girl, who was now just few meters away from me. There she was running towards me in a heavy breath and thumping bare feet that had the same beat as my startled heartbeat. In a panicking voice, she told me she needed a ride away from this place asap and sat in the back seat without asking me permission. 

Now that I was much closer to her, I could see some bruises and red color around her face that looked like blood. I was scared thinking she was kidnapped or was a victim of domestic violence. I told her not to worry and that I will take care of her. Without asking any questions, we drove off into the dark galli's once again. She put her two hands on my shoulders and held it tight while I drove as fast as I could.

I had no idea where I was going. I was taking a route that was taking me further away from home and my mama's house. After a minute or two, I saw a faint light getting brighter and brighter. It was a kirana pasal that was still open. The owner was outside burning wood and getting ready to make tea. I felt a relief and told the teenage girl to stay on the scooter while I called for help. I told her again not to worry and that I will take care of whatever problem she was facing. I walked towards the owner and explained what had happened and to call for help. The owner looked puzzled and gazed at me from the bottom to the top like I was some mad man. He then pointed at my scooter and said there was no one there. 

HA? I became the puzzled one. I started running all around the place looking to find the girl. The owner once again with a smear on his face asked what I was looking for? I said loudly from a distance ""the girl"". With a smile, he assured me there was now one with me when I arrived. The hair on back of my head stood up and I felt a big goosebump. It took me a minute before I was able to light my cigarette with my shaky hands. I went to the nearest police station and we went looking for the girl for 2 hours. We couldn't find her and the search was called off. I am now back home. The vivid memory of her face and the event that transpired is still haunting me. Its been only a few hours and my body is starting to feel heavy. I have lost appetite and sleep.

EDIT:

**UPDATE**: Police just called me. They have found 3 teenage girls and a black gown in kirana Pasal's house. They want me to go there and identify if the girl is among them. I will keep you posted.

**Update 2**: I am on the Kirana pasal house now. She is not here. All 3 girls have been confirmed to be shop owners daughters. I heard the mumbling voice again that I first heard when I saw her. It was on the 3rd floor and sounded Newari.  I have no idea what it meant as I don't speak Newari. I reported it to the police there, and we checked every inch of the building including surrounding houses. She was nowhere to be found. Maybe it is my sleep deprivation making me hear voices. 

The only evidence linking the owner and the girl is the gown. The owner says he found the gown on a river bank 2 weeks ago and brought it home for his daughters. Daughters have no idea about the gown. This doesn't make any sense. This is the same gown the teenage girl was wearing and I'm 100% sure. It even has the tear on the shoulders that was clearly visible last night. The owner has now been arrested and taken into police custody for questioning. I know he is lying and I hope we find the girl safe. 

**Update 3**: I am not feeling well. I just puked my dinner out and my body is acting strangely. I feel a lot heavier instead of getting lighter. I took 2 cetamol tablets and tried to sleep. But my eyes are not shutting down. My grandmother is worried because she thinks I saw a ghost and is wanting me to meet bhairav baba at Maharjgunj. While my mother thinks I am imagining things and wants me to go check up at a mental hospital. How can they be so irrational? Who even believes in such things as ghost or spirits in this century? I saw the girl with my own two eyes and she even physically touched me. Maybe if the non-believers were present with me last night, they would believe my story.

**Update 4**: With my rapid weakening health, my family including my strict dad wants me to see someone asap who can cure me. This is very strange because everyone in my house is fit and healthy and now here I have my dad worried about me, the only son in the family. We workout every week and we have a strict diet.  We never had a problem where someone could get so sick in a matter of hours. With my irrational family and my short options, it's either the bhairav baba or the mental hospital. 

I have seen many Bollywood and Kollywood movies about mental hospitals, and trust me, it looks like a Hell if you get admitted there. Also if I ever get admitted to a mental hospital, people will think I'm crazy for life. This would be the last option of mine. I was able to convince my dad to see the bhairav baba first. Whats there to lose? You can act like you got cured and stay home and rest. Let's see how this goes.

**Update 5**: So now here I am at bhairav baba place at maharajgunj. The house is a typical old Newari house located in the middle of modern concrete houses. Never had I imagined such a place to exist in the middle of nowhere. And who would have ever thought that bhairav baba would turn out to be a woman and not a man? 

Right now my neck is sore and my back hurts. I just took my temperature few minutes ago and it is now 108 degree. Ohh whats there to lose to make your family comfortable than being admitted to a mental hospital, right?. I'm fifth in line and will be administered soon. 

**Update 6**: My turn finally came. While the occasional pain on my body and my headache reminded me that this wasn't over, I was at least feeling some kind of joy that this was finally coming to an end to fulfill my families wishes. I took a seat in front of the baba and told her what had happened. And before I could finish the full story,  the baba suddenly looked straight at me with her eyes wide open. She immediately splashed some water over both my shoulders with what seems like a small broom made out of grass and whispered some words that sounded like Sanskrit. This took me totally off guard. My heart was once again beating to the same beat of the thumping sound of the teenage girl running toward me. I was immediately given a mirror to hold in front of my face. Then the baba hand fed me some sweet ladoos which I enjoyed thoroughly especially after all those lost appetites. 

I have been directed to take a short toilet break from where I write to you. And then I have to stay at the corner of the room for few hours, close my eyes, meditate and concentrate on the mirror. I don't know what this does but let's see how it goes. This will take some time.

**Update 7**: OK, this can't be correct. NO WAY !! what the hell??? How can this be true? I have never ever taken hard drugs my whole life, and even if I did, I find this moment hard to believe. I am a millennial who believes in science and not some shady harry porter nonsense. 

After 30 minutes into meditation and focusing on the mirror, I was able to finally close my eyes and go into a deep state of meditation sleep. I don't know if the ladoos were drugged and helped me close my eyes, but I would surely recommend this baba's ladoos to others if it's just for the taste. But what I saw in my sleep was not what I had ever imagined seeing. This wasn't some kind of Freddy Krueger bullshits chasing you in your dreams. This was a sleep that was real in reality. 

As I meditated and focused on the image on the mirror, I slowly started seeing a hand appear resting on my right shoulders. I was a little confused. Then I turned the mirror on my left and saw another hand. I snapped my head back immediately but nobody was behind me. 

I felt scared and my heart started thumping to sound of that girl's feet again. I tried my best to open my eyes but I couldn't. I tried shouting with my mouth wide open hoping people outside my mediation sleep would hear me and wake me up. But there was no actual sound coming out of my mouth. If any of you have ever had a bad dream, you know what this feels like. Only this time it was a real reality dream.

Being scared, I tried standing up on my feet to move to a different position. I had to focus all my energy on my legs. When I did stand up, there on a far foggy distance I saw someone carrying a huge load approaching towards me. It was the same baba who had fed me the ladoos. Without uttering any words she put this huge load in front of where I was standing. It was a full body mirror with the sides decorated with flowers. There was also some Sanskrit words scribbled to it which I did not understand. 

To my surprise, what I saw on that mirror is not what anyone would have guessed. There it was, this teenage girl who I had seen last night, and she was clinging to my back in a piggyback position. She had a grin smile on her face and looked directly at me. I felt that goosebump again, and just as that image was processing to my brains the mirror cracked. Bhairav baba woke me up immediately. My back was all wet.

Baba has told me to rest but not close my eyes yet. She says she has some special instruction for me to follow. In the meantime, I am thinking deeply about my beliefs now and you all should too.",1532412671.0

Why?",8,5br2mv,Nepal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/5br2mv/so_i_go_around_reading_comments_on_facebook_under/,44,"If there are Nepali people here supporting Trump, feel free to explain why? Would like to hear your side of the story.

Here is why I don't support Trump 

1. He is a racist MOFO

2. Manipulating numbers

3. He quotes alot of unscientific research as though it's true (numbers/ Polls)

4. He is someone who has filed multiple backcruptcies because he failed in businesses.

5. Treats women like objects

6. Spreads his own conclusion into sensitive matters even without real justice/facts conclusion.

7. Spreading violence against race.

8. Thinks what he says is true.

9. Calls media, FBI, Polls bias/rigged whenever they say negative about him.

10. Tries taking revenge/sueing on people he is against.

11. Even though there are video evidence of him saying some bad statements/judgements, he says he didn't say that.

12. He does not pay money to small people that work for him.( Iv been in this situation twice and  it's really bad)

And many more...

The biggest part related to Nepalese in US is racism IMO. And people who have been to or in US know why, especially those that look mexican or Indian(mistaken for Muslims). Even though Trump says he supports Hindu, his followers will judge you by your skin and color and call you racist shit. He has done nothing but bring out those hidding racist bastards out of their boxes. His followers are the same people that think punjabi's are muslims. If you are a Nepalese with a US citizen, please go vote for Hillary. Take your parents with you, your friends wth you.

Trump is no different  than most current nepali politicians, infact 10 times more worse. No wonder  KKK, neo-nazis and majority of uneducated American are supporting Trump in America.",1478606257.0

Nepal-Qatar: The Void and the Fullness 

5:30 pm ‚Ä¢ 14 July, 2016 (Thursday) ‚Ä¢ Yala Maya Kendra, Patan Dhoka 

Nepal is being emptied. Before the earthquakes of 2015, driven by a lack of job opportunities at home, each day, 1500 Nepalis were going abroad to work, mainly to Malaysia, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Despite a degrading life and work conditions, violence, heat, suicides, accidents, ‚Äòheart attacks‚Äô, abuses, the cost of the journey, the daily life in the labour camps, and solitude, Nepalis leave, and leave again, making their fellow countrymen want to leave as well.

This more or less voluntary siphoning off of the labour force of Nepal, and the reverse cash flow amounting to 30 per cent of the country‚Äôs GDP, have huge implications on the social fabric. Women are left alone to take care of the household. Matrimonial ties loosen. The elders, who were traditionally looked after by the younger generations, are also alone. Agriculture is receding due to a lack of farmers. Villages are being impoverished.

Hence, the questions: At what cost is this additional income generated? What is the cost for the men who migrate? For the families who stay behind? For the villages? For the nation?

Photographer Fr√©d√©ric Lecloux tries to raise this question through a photographic dialogue between the two sides of the same one absence in Nepal and Qatar.

I'm a photojournalist who just got back from working on a project for three weeks in Nepal. The project is about one of the first domestic violence shelters in the country, and as a part of the project, I interviewed several  of the women living in the shelter as well as a lawyer who is representing them in their various court cases. I had a translator with me during the interviews, but the responses in Nepali were often very long and the translation was very broad - I don't doubt its accuracy, but I would like to use the Nepali audio with subtitles in a video for the project, and having their words more specifically translated to match the timing of the video would be very helpful. The project is going to be published on March 8 for a Dutch audience, so I am making a version with Dutch subtitles as well as English, so if anyone out there by chance also speaks Dutch, that would be incredibly lucky for me, but otherwise I can handle translating from English to Dutch.

So, I come to you, /r/Nepal, to see if anyone here is interested in helping me with this, or knows anyone who could, please either reply here or send me a direct message! As the video has to be done before March 8, this is fairly urgent so I look forward to any replies! Thank you in advance for any help.",1360535648.0

2,2,I was offered Bribe to Help frame CJI in the Sexual Harrasment complaint against him: Utsav Bains (Lawyer who represented Victim in Asharam Bapu case),342,bflqus,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bflqus/i_was_offered_bribe_to_help_frame_cji_in_the/,108,"This is a facebook post from Utsav Bains, the lawyer who represented the victim and won against Asharam Bapu for rape case.  

Since no media outlet has picked up this story yet, and it shows the other side of this case (I was too guilty of passing judgements on CJI) - I am pasting the contents of his FB Post. There is no way we can verify which side is speaking the truth but we should be listening to both the sides. 

Full Text of his facebook post is as below.

-----------------
I was offered bribe to help frame CJI in the sexual harassment case by lawyering and organising a Press Conference against the CJI for the Ex SC staffer who has accused the CJI of sexual harassment just a few days back and also specifically asked to organise a press conference only at the Press Club of India.

When I refused the person who was initially praising my pro bono work in the Asaram Rape case for the victim etc and interestingly claimed to be her relative but on the other hand looked like a trained agent and he also couldn‚Äôt satisfactorily reply as to what was his relationship with the Ex SC Staffer and then suddenly offered me 50 lacs as my legal fees if I agreed to lawyer and again he asked me specifically to organise a press conference at the PCI after I refused as I found the story facts fishy and also he couldn‚Äôt reply to any question about the many loopholes in the story he narrated. When I again refused he said 1.5 Cr. I then asked him to leave my office.

I then enquired more about this issue from reliable sources in Delhi for days, every information pointed to a larger conspiracy to make the CJI resign and kingpin of which are many Delhi based SC fixers or those who engage in cash for Judgements.

I was convinced about a well planned conspiracy after days of getting such credible information.

I then finally went to CJI residence yesterday evening to inform him about the bribe offer and the conspiracy, around 7 pm. But his staff said he‚Äôs not at his residence. My CDR tower location details can be checked.

Later at night I then called a SC reporter with impeccable proven integrity to meet me today for an important subject and also asked him if he could arrange a urgent meeting or get a message sent to the CJI asap. I had also today morning planned to meet Prashant Bhushan Sir and Kamini Jaiswal maam about this.

But then today morning my perception turned out to be true.

After hours of ponder and soul searching, I have decided to speak the truth and file a detailed affidavit in this regard in the SC along with evidences of the conspiracy against the CJI by a lobby of disgruntled judges, SC fixers, corporate scamsters and a few corrupt Politicians - All who have meticulously planned the conspiracy to force the CJI to resign as their ‚ÄòCorrupt works were not going through in SC‚Äò

After today I will not be appearing in any case in the court of the CJI. Also, I have never personally interacted with the CJI or anyone close to him, my electronic records etc are open to any independent scrutiny. I will leave legal practice if anyone can prove that I have associated or even interacted with CJI outside the Court room ever. As a matter of principle I don‚Äôt butter or bootlick judges.

I was stopped to go public by some senior wellwishers and told that lobby of judges who is planning this conspiracy will turn against me and harm me professionally. But my conscious doesn‚Äôt allow me to turn my face away and let history record today‚Äôs day as the darkest day in the history of SC.

I moved to Delhi from Chandigarh as I refused to be institutionalised in judicial nepotism. My grandfather is a retired HC judge who appointed many HC judges and father a senior lawyer, many of his friends or my family friends are HC Judges at PB HRY HC - Precisely the reason why I moved to lawyer in Delhi.

In SC until now I have only associated in SC with the likes of Prashant Bhushan and Kamini Jaiswal and with Anupam Gupta in PB HRY HC, all who are known for standing against financially corrupt and morally corrupt judges and against judicial nepotism, fearlessly.

I have till date never associated with any kin or kith of SC judges as principle of having a clean legal practice and refusing to be institutionalised in nepotism or be a member of the uncle judges young lawyer club.

Now, it's been more than a year that I get calls and SMS from hathway everyday asking me to renew my account. They call me from different numbers everytime and this has made me run out of patience. I even contacted the company on Twitter complaning about the issue to which their response was ""we will call you shortly and sort the issue out"".

4,4,Police officer verbally abused me when dropping my sister at her workplace who is a bank officer and is compelled to work in this corona curfew,256,gc2ukh,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gc2ukh/police_officer_verbally_abused_me_when_dropping/,71,"Here is the background of the incident. 

Corona virus has started spreading like wildfire in Chennai. But as you may all aware Banks are almost fully functional as per government directive. But what most of you may not be aware is that the Banks have not arranged any kind of transport assistance to it's employees. So, it has fallen upon me to pickup and drop off  my sister, who is an officer at a PSB, from and to the bank which is situated 8 KMs away from our residence.

This frequent commutation has been a nightmarish experience from day-1. On the way, we are usually stopped by police at one or two check points. Bank has provided me with a permission letter with my vehicle details. But Police have never been friendly or patient. Every single experience with the police have been very harsh. They always speak in a very arrogant and disrespectful manner. It is hard to explain them my reason for traveling, especially when driving without my sister on the way back home in the morning or on the way to bank in the evening.

Today morning, we were stopped on the way to bank, my sister displayed her ID Card to the police. The police person in white uniform said something, I couldn't hear him properly. I was wearing a mask within my helmet. He was also wearing a mask. So, I moved my bike a bit to get a little bit closer to him so that I can hear him. He immediately started shouting - ""Mutta Payale, Mutta Payale, angaye niruthuda"". It could be translated as, ""Dumb F###er, stop right there, idiot!"".

It made me so furious. But I knew I can't say anything. We explained politely that we are going to bank. He then checked my driving licence. I know if I questioned why he is being impolite, I will end up having my bike confiscated for some innovative reason. After ensuring everything was okay, he let us go and movee away from us. When I was about to start the bike, another police person in Khaki stopped and inquired us again. I had to explain the story again before he let us move.

This is not an isolated incident. Similar incidents are occuring repeatedly. Two things about this makes me outrageous.

1.) Why aren't the Banks not arranging safe commutation for its employees, especially for women employees ? Am I getting paid to go through such an ordeal every single time ? 

2.) How can police be so arrogant without any impunity ? I just can't stand this fact. Why do they have to showcase their power every single time ? Yes, I agree. We are all slaves ane have to bear silently all the harrasment done by the police. But I still can't digest the reality that Police can say or do whatever they want, and we can't do anything about that. He abused me. He didn't even say sorry. He didn't hesitate for a moment to abuse me. He didn't even feel the need to apologise. And you know what, yet I couldn't say a single word. Not a single word. If I had asked him to apologise, it would have only made the situation more worse. 

And my worst fear is that some people might tell me that ""It's no big deal"". That is, police harrasments are taken for granted. That is what making me more outrageous. This is the kind of atmosphere that allows the police abuse to flourish. This is not fair.

With no body and facial hair. Baby faced. Sharp featured. Pink lips. Big Eyes and eyelashes. Silky hair. Firm poking tits. Big puffy pink sensitive tender areolas. Bubble butt. Wide Lovehandles. Wide hips. Perfect Hourglass. I look like the dream girl matrimonial ads and bollywood wants you to fap to and other girls envy about.  And most likely the girls you tend to fap to on porn sites. 

But I have a penis. I‚Äôm a Heterosexual boy below 19.    

I have a condition called ‚ÄúGynecomastia ‚Äì or man boobs, moobs, lady lumps, bitch tits‚Äù or whatever. My body is filled with estrogen which makes me look feminine. Doc and my counselor said it was in the genes but none of the males in my family seem to have this. I did research on my own and suspect that it could be BISPHENOL (a plastic). 

My nickname was ‚ÄúMilkman‚Äù or ‚ÄúDoodhwala‚Äù (title christened to me by a girl in class 7). The following is what I got to hear from boys AND GIRLS while growing up. Some of them are like the comments you see on porntube.

‚ÄúDude, you are turning into a girl !‚Äù

‚ÄúYou need a bra‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish I had your chest‚Äù ‚ÄúYour‚Äôs are bigger than mine‚Äù

‚ÄúYuck, dude have you even looked at yourself in the mirror ? You have boobs. Theri aukat‚Ä¶‚Ä¶(blah) (blah)‚Äù (First girl I proposed to)

‚ÄúGross ! your buttocks are too big‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to use your bum as my pillow‚Äù (after pillows were stolen from the bus)

‚ÄúLook at those pink flowers‚Äù (girl seeing me shirtless in pool)

‚ÄúLift your shirt‚Äù

‚ÄúNice chest !‚Äù

‚ÄúCan I suck on those ?‚Äù (and the question was rhetorical, he goes ahead without permission anyway)

‚ÄúYour fat ass is selling hot‚Äù (Translation of Teri Gaand bik raha hai)

‚ÄúShut up or I‚Äôll squeeze your tits‚Äù *chorus Laughter in the background* How every argument involving me ends. I was the class monitor, no one respected me. 

‚ÄúDude, can you lick those titties ?‚Äù

‚ÄúBable bai kaise ho? Padai kaisa chal raha hai‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚Äú Bhai, thuje weight kam karna hai, gym mat jai, height kam ho jaya football kelthe he‚Äù (one of the more polite ones)

‚Ä¶.and on the playground ‚ÄúBatle hila/dika/chooz gaandu‚Äù. Reported it to my coach, he taps my ass and says ‚Äúloose weight‚Äù. I show him my flat pack stomach, he laughs even further and moves away. 

‚ÄúYour breasts are very milky milky‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me massage your breasts‚Äù (Two guys hold me while he films me getting rubbed shirtless)

AND MUCH WORSE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I lived in a hostel in boarding school, an ‚Äòinternational‚Äô one. I was harassed, had my tits squeezed/sucked, ass grabbed atleast once in two weeks, especially after bath or the playground BY BOTH GIRLS AND BOYS (although most harassers happened to be boys). Our school shirt was tight fitting, giving away my ‚ÄúHot‚Äù figure. I left the hockey team because, during summer we had to play shirtless and my teammates (and the coach) would often stare at my tits jiggling up and down while laughing. Some try to touch it. Once found a dude jerking off at me while I was in bath towel. I stopped taking bath when everyone else did, I started taking bath at night. Whenever I never wokeup, the dorm head senior used to squeeze my tits while I was asleep to watch my wake up in fright and then laugh at it.  

My juniors posted photos of my nipples being forcefully licked & twisted at dorm on facebook after tearing my shirt while I was sleeping in the dorm. Even girls ‚Äòliked‚Äô it and commented nasty, one of those girls included the crush I had a feelings for. That day I deleted my facebook and orkut. I told my relatives, it was because I wanted to concentrate on studies.

I remember whenever we ran out of milk in the cafeteria, the girls would yell out ‚ÄúDoodhwala, please refill the milk‚Äù indirectly referring to me. Once the cook told that the milkman hasn‚Äôt come, one of the girl, pinched my tits real tight, and said he is right here. I groped her back, she didn‚Äôt like it and she moved away, never to talk to me again. 

After a lot of ignoring and playing along (laughing together with folks laughing at me), I got tired of it, I got into fights, but turned into laughing stock because I was too weak and alone while they were many. My punches and kicks were so weak and slow, that I looked like a cat trying to push lions with its paws. Everynight I lost a fight, I felt like picking up the knife from the kitchen and stab all those who groped me which included 35% of the boys and 7% of the girls in my class. Something like stabbing version of the mass shootouts you hear about in Murrica. 

I wished there were other boys with bitch tits so that time being molested by the bullies would have been shared by us both but unfortunately I was the only one. There are fat kids who have moobs, but they aren‚Äôt made fun off much, because their chests were too saggy, unlike those of preteen girls. Mine was 75% breast tissue pointing towards the sky, so fat people joined in to make fun of me. I hogged as much as fast food as I can so I looked more fat instead of a skinny dude with tits and ass, but was still not turning fat, but instead I‚Äôm making my butt grow more round and boobs grow more perkier. 

There was a handicapped kid who was being made fun off by a bully, Teacher spotted it and told the bully to stop. I found a new ray of hope in her. I gathered courage to tell it to the teacher, when I told it, she laughed just like the folks harassing me. Being handicapped gains you sympathy, being a boy with bitch tits groped makes you a joke whom everyone can harass without consequences. And by the way even the handicapped kid used to laugh at me while people made fun of my lady lumps. Hate to generalize, but I started hating handicapped people from then on too. 

My mom forced me to join swimming classes during holidays, boys and girls in the class made fun of me there too. Giggling behind my back. This included swimming instructors, pretending to unknowingly touch my chests and laugh. Boys who were 4 years younger than me tried touching my tits before I smacked the. I became paranoid, whenever I see someone staring at my chest, I feel nervous and sometimes I turn paranoid that someone is going to grope me from behind‚Äì like it used to happen a lot during school while we sat in queues. So I turn around to see who is behind very often.

I try to make new friends but as soon as we get easy, almost every one of them have remarked about my feminine characteristics or grope me. I have been gropped in full public view by multiple people even in college, I have no respect I‚Äôve been the butt of jokes and have my own trademark ‚Äì ‚Äúthe boy with boobs‚Äù. I have contemplated suicide multiple times. HOWEVER, the anonymity of the internet saved me, letting me escape my identity through a make believe world where I can be who I want to be. 

Everytime I felt down, I watched The Shawshank redemption. I dreamt of going to a place where no human exists and pursue hobbies in music, but BC, I‚Äôm too broke for that too. Instead I turned sadistic, everytime I heard news of people being killed, I rejoiced in joy, thinking there is one less potential harraser in this planet. Once, I saw another boy with tits similar to mine, He looked at me back too, in that glance, I felt like I met my twin after so many years, his stare reflected that we had the same experiences, I moved towards him but he ran away ‚Äì that night I felt like I lost someone very close wondering why he ran away so fast. 

Now at college, thank god there is no dresscode. I never wear tight polo shirts or pants. I dress hip hop minus the gold chains. I never grow my hair. I sit at home and play video games, avoid going out. I always pray for winter to come and people obviously know that I wear winter clothes in summer to hide my tits. I always walk with a hunch. I bind my chest, lovehandles and ass together with that device which was supposed to make tummy look smaller.  Once a dude found it out, I told him it‚Äôs a bulletproof vest and that my brother is in the army. Once in the college, I overheard women rating the boys in class, one of them mentioned how she found me cute but another remarked how I had breasts like a women because my hormones are fucked and feminine boys tend to be bad in bed (scientifically). That moment the other girl turned around, noticed me sitting and remarked ‚ÄúShit!‚Äù. I moved away from the scene. 

After holding it up for a long time, I told my parents like many had advised on the internet, but they don‚Äôt seem to care ‚Äì they say I need to reduce weight. Oh, and my sister laughed. I suspect society would have acted differently if I were a girl with tits instead of a boy. I came up with a new lie later to my family saying that I‚Äôm not producing much sperms and need to go to a hormone specialist. I‚Äôm taking medication and testosterone patches, hitting the gym, but it isn‚Äôt working yet, I‚Äôm just turning into those muscular girl models. I‚Äôm too broke now after all the expenses on supplements, I‚Äôm thinking of leaving college, working at a call center, saving money for a breast tissue removal and liposuction. If I mention surgery for this purpose, It would rise red alerts and news would spread as surgery for aesthetics is frowned upon, I will have to makeup another lie stating that I have breast cancer or something with fake documents after bribing a doc. 

If any of you happen to be the boys and girls who harassed me, you‚Äôd obviously remember. I would like to let you know that you did your part in ruining my life. I hope it gave you a lot of joy. I had plans to save up to buy a sniper rifle on the darkweb to hunt you all down, but don‚Äôt worry, the plan is too impractical.

Another side of me, wants to accept the fact that I‚Äôm a hermaphrodite or something. I try hard to turn Bisexual, but fail at all attempts.

It is a great power that we have today, but remember we also have have everything from trolls to people who just want to destroy somebody's career for giggles and even financial gains.

I was really surprised this week since r/India often demands proof before any kind of blaming and yet on every anon WhatsApp screenshot Twitter trend there is male bashing.

Just lask week rohtak sisters were back trending for the way they destroyed multiple guys life. Yet this week nobody is asking proof or demanding any legal recourse.

I am sorry, but I am a guy who really needs to see proof or atleast some kind of justification. 

Case in point 3: Vikas bahl.. I believe what has been blamed on him.. You know why? Because it was often brought up for years.. Just that nobody was paying attention. Which tells me that nobody was gaining anything by calling him out. He was reported repeatedly. Not suddenly out of the blue stories started surfacing which is happening right now.

A few minutes after we'd passed them, we heard the patroling police stop beside the couple. One policeman got off the bike and started admonishing the couple. He tried to make the girl feel 'ashamed' for sitting with a boy in the middle of the night, and threatened to call their parents! When the girl said that they were just talking, he replied that he knew exactly what they were doing.
First of all, how is it okay to harrass two people who are minding their own business, in the name of 'decency'? Secondly, these are not students or kids. These were adults with jobs who earn their own damn living.
Thirdly, is this what the patrol police is paid to do? How will this contribute to increasing security in the area? Is this why I pay the taxes, so innocent citizens can be harrassed? 
And lastly, why is it that in all such cases the girl is made to feel guilty for associating with a boy? Even if it was a crime, which it isn't, wouldn't the boy be equally responsible?

Thereafter, we patched up things and I visited her several times in Bangalore and everything was fine. I also moved to Bangalore from Delhi to support my upcoming family. Later after delivery of my child, my in-laws started conspiring against me again and when my mother (only immediate relative I have) visited to see my baby, they had an ugly social spat with us over a pointless issue. Dejected, I shifted back to Delhi and I and my wife limited our conversations to WhatApp and phone. I visited Bangalore yesterday after 6 weeks of baby delivery to get my baby immunized. My wife has taken this chance to further alienate me from the baby and picked up another pointless fight on WhatsApp. She abused me and my family and started harassing me and now is threatening me with a obviously false dowry harrasment / 498a case. I am alone in Bangalore without immediate family support and am scared if they will act tomorrow against me.

For example - Suppose a woman is giving false rape/harrasment case against a guy. And in person she says - Beta ab tu dekh, Meri toh har koi sunega lekin Teri koi nahi sunega. The guy says - But it's false !
The girl says- yeah prove karke Bata. Koi yakeen nahi karega 

And badam, unknowing to girl, this was recorded by a small camera/audio device. Now my curious ques is whether it can be used in court as an evidence of the women lying as she herself admitted to it. 

Or will the video/audio be discarded on the ground of not being consensual?

On 24th October a student of National Law University, Delhi from a socio-economically disadvantaged background (he's a dalit with a physically disabled father and only his mother earning) drank a poisonous liquid to attempt suicide. He was quickly rushed to hospital and thus, has survived but is still in a critical condition.

CONTEXT- He circulated a suicide note before the attempt in which he stated the reasons for attempting suicide as follows:

i. Social exclusion and shaming after a false allegation of sexual harrasment.

ii. The Internal Complaints Committee which was supposed to decided on the complaint had already made up its mind about the truth of the complaint, and therefore conducted its proceedings in an extremely biased manner; violating all prescribed procedures and Principles of Natural Justice.


I wanted to bring it to the attention of the people here that public shaming and assuming that ALL such allegations are true without investigating is NOT the way to reduce instances of sexual harassment and can and will lead to such cases.

The only way to improve situation imo for all is to improve the justice delivery system (police and judiciary) and a social change.

I am in need of some legal advice. A friend of mine was employed with a small firm since last 1 years. He resigned from the job (intimated by an email) and stopped going to work altogether.
Now the thing is the employer has started harrasing my friend on basis of him not serving the notice period and him taking another employment while already in job. (Details later)
Some details due to which my friend resigned and left without serving the notice period -
1) Monthly payment cycles were highly irregular with salary credit to account ranging from 1st week to 4th week of the month or even the next month. (Once the due salary was provided through cheque , which bounced, this matter was resolved later on)
2) Although there are more than 20 employees in the company, the company is not providing any PF amount to my friend. ( I guess this is illegal )
3) Moreover the duty time was highly irregular with extreme work pressure and constant bullying and mental harassment by the top management
4) my friend is aware of multiple occasions when the employer tried to avoid paying proper GST taxes and forge customer billing documents. This kind of shady financial ethics by the employer was creating additional pressure on my friend.
5) in an effort to get away from this job,  recently my friend started his own startup while still employed with the aforementioned employer.  He was doing all of the startup related job outside of his work hours. When he realised it was no longer sustainable he sent his resignation inorder to focus more on his new initiative.

The thing is because of the 5th point above and some personal history the managing director in particular has started threatening my friend , his wife and other family members with probable police action and lawsuits.  My friend and his family members  are really scared because of all this. These threats are coming in the form of WhatsApp messages, phone calls and emails. The messages mostly talk about breach of contract because of dual employment and unserved notice period.

What I want to know is what is the legal course of action in such cases and how likely is that the employer in question can take some legal action ? Or are they merely trying to scare my friend and his family with empty threats. And if at all the employer takes any legal action what are the things that we should be prepared with ??

Let me know if I should be giving any more details. Really looking for some suggestions/advice here.

Some time back I posted about my stolen dog.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5lk2yz/urgent_help_required_please_help_me_identify_the/)

Yesterday, in the night, my brother received a phone call. We had put up missing dog posters around our locality with his phone number on it. The caller said that he had Coco and directed us to transfer Rs. 10,000/- to his bank account. When my brother asked him to show proof of him having the dog, he said he doesn't use Whatsapp and in fact uses a very basic phone. However, he said he was 110% sure it was indeed Coco he had. 

We immediately contacted the Investigating Officer of the case. The IO told us not to transfer any money and to meet him in the morning.

Today morning, when my brother went to the IO, he did the most incredibly stupid-ass thing. The IO made my brother call him from his office and put the call on loudspeaker. The caller repeated the same stuff from last night. To this, the IO says ""I am talking from the police station and I am the investigating officer of the case"". And then he requested him to return the dog to us asap else they will track him and arrest him. The caller cut the call then and there and switched off his mobile number. 

A few things transpired in between wherein I spoke with some of my contacts and friends to understand what could be done now. Consequently, when I tried his phone number after some time, the call connected. I told him not to talk with anybody else but me and I was ready to pay him the money. He told me to transfer only Rs. 2,000. He refused to take the cash in person and said he was under the apprehension that he might get beaten up if he met in person. He then contradicted himself and said he will come to our house and take us to some place where he would hand over Coco to us. Confused, I told him to give me some time to think.

He called me again after 10 minutes and told me to transfer only Rs. 1,000 to his bank account (bank details messaged to me much earlier). 

I am in touch with police and they have told me not to transfer any money and that they will trace him from the bank account details and raid his address. 

My concerns are the following:

1. He hasn't shared anything which confirms that Coco is indeed with him. It could be any random stranger who came across the poster and called me for the lulz.

2. I have no problems transferring Rs. 1,000 as it isn't a big amount but I don't know how fruitful this exercise would be.

3. The police said they will be able to track him down today or tomorrow. Should I wait till tomorrow?

4. I am almost sure that the bank account will not be linked to him directly. Maybe his friend, friend's friend etc. But even from the bank account details, we would not be able to exactly track the caller. Some acquaintance, friend.. but maybe not him.

5. Coco is a female beagle. Her heat period is around. Why will someone sell it to me for Rs. 1,000? Why not sell Coco in the illegal market for exponential price? Or get her to breed and sell her pups for even higher price?

Please help me reddit. Please let me know what I could do and should do in this scenario.

EDITS: Added points 3, 4 and 5.

**UPDATE**: 
**16.02.2017**
The caller has gone mental. He called my sister incessantly yesterday atleast 10-12 times after she initially showed her intention to pay the money. I am convinced this is obviously a scam and told her not to take the calls anymore. He didn't call yesterday after evening time.

Today, he has started calling her from a different number. He has already called my sister 7-8 times till now (it is 2.40pm when I'm posting this update). I don't know what to do.

The police has been very very lazy. The IO didn't do anything at all yesterday. The IO told me he will have the details of the person from his mobile number and bank account by today morning. However, when in the morning I called him, he said it will take some more time. I called him 5 minutes back, and he said he is at the bank getting the details. He is just being lazy and wants to avoid the hassle. As someone suggested in the comments, paying him some money might instil some motivation - I'm not sure idealism is the ground I want to hold right now. 

I have made my sister call the Additional DCP and she told him that she is being harrased by the caller as he is constantly calling her and also from different number. 

The person's stand is that it is only Rs. 1,000 and do we not want our dog back. This is obviously a scam cause he hasn't provided any sort of proof to show that he indeed has Coco with him. This is easy money for him but my sister is getting impatient and desperate to try everything out. This has given a ray of hope which is stupid but existent.

So please remember to buy, it costs only 10/-  
And try to enter thriugh main gate only, if you say that you were going to buy they won't hear any of it.  
100/- is reasonable but not 500/600.

32,32,Where are the feminists when you need them?,75,331e6e,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/331e6e/where_are_the_feminists_when_you_need_them/,46,"This is a good example of the hypocrisy that we see regarding rights of women in India. I'm sure you all remember the \#MyChoice video by Vogue and Deepika. it sparked a big controversy online. People who criticised it were attacked by rabid women on the internet who saw it as a violation of their freedom.

However, recently, [this happened.](http://www.jagran.com/news/national-women-won-the-election-oath-taken-by-husbands-12198926.html)

For the non Hindi speakers, its a news article about a village in Chattisgarh, where a few women were elected Panches. However, when it came to the oath-taking ceremony, it was their husbands who took oath instead of the women themselves.

This is unacceptable and clearly defeats the whole purpose of the government reserving seats for women candidates. Any one who is familiar with villages will attest to this; in almost all cases, even though the Panch/Sarpanch on paper is a woman, the actual power is with her husband who does all the work and is actually considered the village head. The women's life remains the same as before, doing housework and remaining under her husband's thumb.

However, there is absolutely no outrage about this; neither on twitter; nor in the MSM. Even though this happened last month, I failed to find an article on any of the main news channel websites about this. No outrage by the ""Facebook feminists"" either.

No comment by eminent feminists like Indira Jaising, [who opposed the amendment in 498A to prevent harrasment of innocent men.](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/government-plans-to-amend-anti-dowry-harassment-law/)

33,33,[Idea to keep our politicians in check] A website that records every shitty thing they ever did. Public can check their track record. This should shut them up.,2,7jrpfp,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7jrpfp/idea_to_keep_our_politicians_in_check_a_website/,4,"Brother and Sisters, I'm fucking fed up of the state of politics in this country. I won't like when BJP got elected I was hopeful for a good change in governance and I even bought their Acche Din propaganda silently. These guys have turned out to be as much of a disappointment than the last guys, except they are offering us a different flavour than the retards at Congress. But Shit is Shit, whoever poops it.  

I have an idea to battle this.. 

###THE WHY

Everybody needs a **good** resume to get a job. Politicians don't. This is why they tend to do whatever they like, say whatever they want, even outside their parties' policy/propaganda schemes etc. 

####There is a lack of a permanent track record

 I'm sure big media channels and press houses have this kind of data, but its not public. And I doubt it is as organized as what we're talking here, and even it is, the knowledge is not public as I mentioned, and even the media is bugged by current events to fish out old stuff.

###THE WHAT

* WE CREATE A WEBSITE THAT MAKES A PERMANENT RECORD

* We record every shitty thing they do, classify them under different heads, like sexism, corruption, lies, untruths, criminal acts, sexual harrasment, mismanagement, xenophobia etc under this. 

   Take [this  recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7jp257/smriti_irani_javadekar_tried_cornering_35000/) 

   Smriti Irani giving away seats 25 times her quota. We can record that under her profile. 

* The more shitty a politician is, the more entries he has under his profile. Like a love child between Wikipedia and LinkedIn. We can check out how bad the person representing us is. 

* The Politicians profile will be fully furnished, everything from his religion, caste, educational background, corporate affiliations, and his wealth. 

* We can show how much his wealth has increased from his previous declarations in his affidavits, and show graphs, and compare them with their real life declared and undeclared assets.

* We can show their past affiliations, many of these lower state level ministers are real opportunist political nomads, they jump to whichever party is paying the most. 

* Prior professions will be highlighted, especially if they are actors or businessmen.

* List of cases registered against them will be shown. Resolved and Unresolved both will be shown separately. Especially if there is a CBI chargesheet registered against them. 

* Politicians will be rated like how passwords are rated strong and weak, there will be a bar that will measure how corrupt they are. 

* Website is not open source, we don't want people to edit it willy nilly. 

* ( WILL UPDATE WITH MORE IDEAS )

###THE HOW

How can such a model be executed properly.

Marriage as an institution has prevailed for centuries with husband & wife mutually sorting out issue of consent for sex. #MaritalRape 2/n

What has changed now that we desperately seek to regulate consent for sex in marriage by criminalisation of #MaritalRape ? 3/n

If a wife is physically / sexually abused, the wife has 2 options. Either stay in marriage or walk out of marriage. 4/n

If wife decides to stay in marriage despite physical/sexual abuse, Domestic Violation Act has enough provisions to deal with situation. 5/n

If wife decides to stay in marriage despite physical & sexual abuse, her primary concern is to end abuse & not send her husband to jail. 6/n

Wife facing physical & sexual abuse & yet wanting to stay in marriage would opt for Domestic Violence Act & not #MaritalRape offence. 7/n

Certain that whoever invokes offence of #MaritalRape will want to walk out of marriage... Question is how many of them will so invoke? 8/n

How many women in India who decide to walk out of marriage (& presumably start new life) would want to pursue a case of #MaritalRape ? 9/n

Do we want #MaritalRape as offence just for handful of women who would actually use it? Mainly to satisfy ego of Women's Organisations? 10/n

Some argue that #MaritalRape would ensure Equality of Husband & Wife in marriage !! Equality with a threat to send a husband to jail ?? 11/n

Unmarried girls particular about unambiguous mutual consent for marital sex can chose their life partners accordingly. 12/n

Girls yet to get into institution of marriage surely not looking at offence of #MaritalRape as only tool to make marriage a success. 13/n

Unable to comprehend as to for whom do these Women's Organisations seek definition & criminalisation of #MaritalRape . 14/n

Do our Women Organisations advocating #MaritalRape realise that Criminal Justice System doesn't function like a Coffee Vending Machine? 15/n

Do our Women Organisations advocating #MaritalRape realise how Police Investigations into an allegation of Marital Rape would be done? 16/n

Don't know if our Women Organisations advocating #MaritalRape applied their mind on the legal consequences & the scope of its misuse. 18/n

Step into Courts... Visit Police Stations... You may realise the magnitude of abuse of Sec498A-IPC & for that matter even Sec376-IPC. 19/n

Good scope for misuse of #MaritalRape against husbands by unscrupulous family of wife (if not wife) for harrasment if not conviction. 20/n

Today we have a wide definition of Rape covering acts beyond actual sex... Apply that to a Marital Relation & imagine the consequences. 21/n

**In practice, Evidence in Criminal Trials for Rape is largely confined to oral testimony of the victim & her medical examination. 22/n**

**Inherent deficiencies in oral testimonies & medical examinations lead to low convictions in Rape Trials. http://anirban-from-rlf.blogspot.com   . 23/n**

The link in the last tweet is to a letter we wrote to Ex-CJI Justice Verma on how to increase conviction rate in Rape Trails.. 24/n

Simplified for understanding, Rape Trial Convictions work in the following manner... Firstly medical examination establishes sex.. 25/n

**Sex proved, Victim's testimony proves lack of consent.... Given our social values, Courts presume Victim won't lie & defame herself. 26/n**

**Read again.. Courts give weightage to testimonies of victim because given our social values, Courts presume victims wont lie about sex. 27/n**

**Thus in sex between persons who are not married, given our social values, words of a Victim are given more value than those of Accused. 28/n**

**The framework in normal Rape Cases (which as such results in low convictions) wouldn't, for many reasons, apply to #MaritalRape Trials. 29/n**

**Medical Examination of wife for traces of evidences left behind by husband after sex would be a meaningless if not laughable exercise. 30/n**

**When we talk of evidences left in the body of a woman by a man after sex, they are many including hair etc.. 31/n**

**Traces of a stranger on the body of a woman means a lot... Common sense that traces of husband in the body of wife means nothing. 32/n**

**So entire evidence in #MaritalRape Trials (except in case of violence) would be oral testimony of wife that she didn't consent to act.  33/n**

**Unlike normal cases, oral evidence of wife wouldn't be treated as sacrosanct. Not social disgrace for wife to talk of sex with husband. 34/n**

**So the status which oral testimony of a victim in other Rapes cases has would not be present in #MaritalRapes .. 35/n**

As such conviction in Rapes is low.. Given the totality of circumstances, how would you get a conviction in #MaritalRape ? 36/n

Considering totality of circumstances, it may not be an exaggeration to say... Conviction in #MaritalRape Trials would be ZERO. 37/n

Some may still ask... Toh Kya Hua? Rehne Do Na.. #MaritalRape Ka Provision Jinko Use Karna Hai Woh Karenge...  Not that simple. 38/n

Though convictions in #MaritalRape Cases will be zero, there will be further clogging of Courts for grievances redressable elsewhere. 39/n

Adverse social & legal consequences.. Handful to use it.. Negligible convictions.. IMO Criminalising #MaritalRape is a Bad Bad Idea. 40/40

37,37,Theories of rapes are projections of our fears,1,165wrt,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/165wrt/theories_of_rapes_are_projections_of_our_fears/,2,"While I don't have solution to sexual harassment in India and there are numerous factors behind this epidemic (patriarchal society, general disregard for human life, law and order failure...), I want to look at the theories on why women are being raped in India. I am not validating or refuting these outrageous theories. Most of them are factually incorrect and reek of general disconnect with reality. My main point here is that I think these weird theories are projection of fears of the people who propound or endorse these crazy ideas. Here are few thoughts:

**'Women wearing revealing clothes lead to rapes'**  
This is typical patriarchal society speaking which wants to control how women behave. Such a mindset is scared of increased freedom and mobility that women have started enjoying in metros and this freedom is percolating in smaller towns too. 

**'What was she doing at that place at such an hour'**  
Such a response stems from the total breakdown of our urban spaces and Delhi is an extreme example of this, where women feel insecure in  broad daylight and don't venture out either not at all or know some places are to be avoided during certain times of the days. This is typically Shila Dixitian response to a case of sexual harassment.

**'It is western culture spoiling our civilization'**  
This mentality is not limited to cases of sexual harassment and this line of argument is used in numerous other issues by cultural chauvinists. Usually this colonial mindset is endorsed by but not limited to extreme right wingers.

**'Increasing objectification of women in media and exposure'**  
Well this indeed can be a factor or may share pathologies with increasing case of sexual harrasment but this argument is also used to shoot down movies which deal with sexual taboos and such rhetoric is ignored when it comes to atrocious item numbers and fairness creams. 

**'Rapes are urban phenomena'**  
Well no one outrightly and explicitly claims this but this line of thinking does sneak in. I have personally heard of this argument by few people hence I am including it here. This can stem from urban alienation and invoking an idyllic rural but what I find puzzling is that people endorsing this view forget that villages or even small towns are no ideal place to live in either. And in villages sexual violence is also used for humiliating enemy family or caste! 

I strongly feel with a epidemic proportions of the problem and it being such a sensitive issue everyone has views and opinions about it and these theories come out as our own insecurities about the society, culture and the law and order system.

**TL;DR**: These weird theories on why women are being raped in India are projections of one's own fear.",1357646615.0

5,5,"VD Savarkar, one of RSS' most venerable thought leaders, advocated using 'rape' as a political tool. He believed Muslim women should be raped to avenge the Muslim rule in India.",337,gi7lza,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gi7lza/vd_savarkar_one_of_rss_most_venerable_thought/,81,"It  is honestly baffling how much we have allowed the normalization of the  RSS, and what little attention is paid to the fact that the two key  progenitors of this organisation, Golwalkar and Savarkar, openly admired  Hitler and Mussolini. What makes this a lot worse is that the praise  continued on into the late 1930s, when it was clear that Nazis were  rounding up and persecuting Jews and other minorities. Unlike Bose,  whose support was out of anti-colonialism, these people admired the  ideology of the fascists. Some quotes from Savarkar validate this:

""There is no reason to suppose that Hitler must be a human monster  because he passes off as a Nazi, Nazism proved undeniably the savior of  Germany.""

""If we Hindus in India grow stronger, in time these Muslim friends of  the League type will have to play the part of German-Jews instead.""

‚ÄúThe very fact that Germany or Italy has so wonderfully recovered and  grown so powerful as never before at the touch of Nazi or Fascist  magical wand is enough to prove that those political ‚Äòisms‚Äô were the  most congenial tonics their health demanded.‚Äù

A nation is formed by a majority living therein. What did the Jews do  in Germany? They being in minority were driven out from Germany.‚Äù

This is from Golwalkar's book which was published in 1939:

""German race pride has now become the topic of the day. To keep up  the purity of the race and its culture, Germany shocked the world by her  purging the country of the Semitic Races - the Jews ... a good lesson  for us in Hindustan for us to learn and profit by.""

This is the same organisation which rules India by proxy, through  various BJP leaders who were all RSS karyakartas at one point in their  political careers. It is the Constitution and our democracy which  prevents them from taking complete control, but they remain an  existential threat to the idea of India. It is surprising how little  most Indians know about this topic, and when you confront any garden  variety sanghi/fascist with this information, they are quick to  prevaricate and seek nuance, nuance not reserved while attacking and  defaming their political rivals.

I have a lot more to vent on this issue, but I will cut this short.  This is not the lame liberal anti-Modi type argument, it goes way beyond  that, and few people realize its implications. Next time the BJP brings  up Nehru and Indira and your obnoxious friend brings up the Congress'  checkered history, do make it a point to bring this up. If history is  what makes people decide who to vote for or not, then these facts  deserve to be brought up in the public discourse as well.

32,32,Although rape is a serious problem in our country that needs to stop. There is another problem of false rape accusations that nobody seems to wanna talk about.,60,fleoe8,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fleoe8/although_rape_is_a_serious_problem_in_our_country/,53,"Before I start, I'd like to make it clear that I do believe Rape is a heinous crime and there should be severe punishments for those who commit it. Having said that, shouldn't someone who is innocent also getting the same punishment and being discarded by society be talked about too? what about the woman who made up the story, shouldn't she be punished for ruining someone's life? 

According to the National Crime Records Bureau, a total of 38,947 rape cases were reported in India in 2016. In 10,068 cases ‚Äì about a quarter ‚Äì the women claimed it was rape on the false promise of marriage. In Andhra Pradesh state, 45% of all rape cases filed in the past two years fell into the false marriage category. Just think about that, every 1 in 3 is an innocent man, and in Andra Pradesh, that's 1 in 2 where for every 2 rape accusations an innocent man's life is ruined.

It's sad because Rape is a very sensitive subject which people avoid talking about and these problems are still happening every day. I'm tired of hearing every other country saying that our country is the rape capital of the world and no one if only a few dares to talk about false accusations. 

I referenced an article in this post for stats and here is the link:  [https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/11/spare-innocent-men-anguish-india-ruling-aims-to-end-false-claims](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/11/spare-innocent-men-anguish-india-ruling-aims-to-end-false-claims)

&#x200B;

We're Fucked. It's not news but still, we're fucked. My feelings like this start with my life long disgust of Indian roads. Anyway, looking into a more serious thing like not a single rape case has been given justice in this country for the time I can remember. Everyone just sucks related to the justice system ( or just people in general?). We worship women Devi a few times a year and the rest of the year they are just slaves of our own making. Are they still just objects of men's world? Heck, even women in power act like Indian men. Terrifying, isn't it?

What kills me inside when the rapists escape the punishment. Police don't take FIR. Forensic/CSI reports don't get submitted. Judge fucking says ridiculous bullshit, bow to power. Rape victim family and witness gets killed by accident before the hearing. Who are these people we vote, we elect, we kill our countrymen on the other sides for?

If hearing a rape news one's blood doesn't boil, that person is not OK. Mentally.

&#x200B;

Comedians becomes journalists.

Journalist becomes \_undefined.

Roads are still shit.

Healthcare is non-existent.

Air Quality is fucked.

Life expectancy is far below expected.

What is Mental Health?

(1+ out of every 10 people is mentally troubled.)

The justice system is fucked.

Taxing, Banking is for Capitalists. It's a mechanism built for sucking poor people dry.

The new is Old Joomlas. With various flavors of biryani or momo.

Media is spineless, corrupt and run by bastards.

Farmers are dying of poverty and decades of neglect.

Everything we eat is with preservatives, pesticides or chemicals.

99% of Indian people don't understand the personal space, privacy of other people at all.

(just get self-conscious for a moment in public lines and get ready to feel weird how close people to you)

Sexual Abuse is just as infectious as new Corona-virus here.

Religion is alright but Religiousness = madness.

97% percent of Indians are sexually frustrated. It's a national problem none want to talk about.

276+ million people in India are below the poverty level. The near-total population of the USA.

Dalits are treated as Dirt.

Sex is not a verb or noun it's a mindset of India.

( How the fuck this country has more population than a few world Continents combined. This proves how suppressed we are to teach and talk to our population about this ancient secret method of reproduction here like area 51)

&#x200B;

Privacy is a joke.

( Last night one fucking chemist just took my prescription photo in his phone, which I just realized how the fuck is this normal? Why I didn't say anything! ) As these little things, we got used to are not normal. I got asked by an HDFC banker to login to my account in his office PC just so he can check some things. Like hell this is normal. What the fuck is wrong with us? Why we're like this, a bunch of peeping toms?

&#x200B;

Apparently, all we worry about is Ram Mandir, Pakistan, Muslims, Momo, Biryani, Joomlas, Babas, Bollywood, Movie Actors and British looted us.

It's fucking 70+ years of Independence, we couldn't make roads properly yet. All media does is make cancerous news headlines and spread communal violence.

&#x200B;

How can we tolerate this for so long? Are you just going out of the country just when you think you can't take it anymore? Are we just pretending to be blind, deaf and brainless when people like Patra and other mambas spray venom all over?

How can we watch these TV channels just doing what they do everyday things like publicly shouting curses, insults, racism, discrimination, lie, polarize and million other cancerous things?

&#x200B;

When was the last time you thought I like this city, town, village, peoples, nature, air, water, schools, transport, your local river, local produce, asked you kids ( IT  specially) are you happy in school, the college the course you're doing, are you happy son/daughter?

When my head won't feel ashamed a foreigner comes to our country cleans the road and we won't laugh at them?

&#x200B;

I'm not ok man. I'm not OK.

Maybe you're not ok too, maybe a slight.

it's alright, you have a life I know.

&#x200B;

Not like me wasting life sitting in my chair. I wish you never feel bad for yourself, but still shouldn't we all. The clusterfuck of the mess we're running in loops. It is what it is, the country we live in today. All due respect to Mahatma Gandhi, he should've taught more action than toleration. It seems nothing is sufficient enough to fight this cancer of these clusterfucks and unfuck ourselves in this modern times.

This is simply extra judicial killings, no proper investigation done. It's not yet established whether they were actually the culprits. The accused were killed while they were taken for evidence collection. The recent movie Article 15 portrayed such events pretty vividly. 

It is ridiculous how people can't think rationally. Appalling. These are people I know and are generally sane. I think common man doesn't have the ability to think beyond superficial logic. And if you let mob justice prevail, then you will be happy until you yourself are crucified. But then again, what do you expect in a society where elected representatives call for mob lynching of the accused. This speaks more to our distrust in the proper rule of law in our country than anything else.

Sorry for the rant, but it is just so overwhelming that I can't ignore it.

As some may have seen the posts of few randian user expressing their surprise to the stuff that came out of their parent‚Äôs mouth regarding violence on muslims. 

Now ask yourself this. How strong do you believe the moral fabric of a country is, which chooses to turn a blind eye to the subjugation of a community based simply on their religion ? How much hard will it be to jump from hating because of religion to hating because of gender. Now, I understand this is comparing apples and oranges because no community will outright become scornful towards an entire gender. The point I‚Äôm trying to make is those who believe they are the superior authority because of ‚Äúreligion‚Äù won‚Äôt like someone challenging their authority and will find ways to prove their power over another. These same people will loathe women making a fuss about harassment, or women fighting for their empowerment. This is discounting the fact that these ‚Äúcamps‚Äù that are being built will only result in cases of absolute horror many of which will never come to light. 

Lastly if there are women reading this, most of you will probably not get in a situation where you‚Äôll be a victim of rape. However I know you know that fleeting dread that comes over you when you feel like you‚Äôre not safe. For you it‚Äôs fleeting but for many that dread only is the start of something much more heinous.

But this is the truth. With some debate about capital punishment for these types of cases, let's say even if any state or central gov. passes this as a law; it will not stop.

It will also not stop even if we hypothetically get fully staffed and vigilant police force. Even if gov. does everything; it will not stop and they are not to blame then and also they are not to blame in this current scenario. This case got a national coverage (not saying it's a bad thing), guess what there are 100's of cases of rapes and murder every year. 

It's the uneducated and even educated people who are responsible for this. Don't you think, they don't know that what they are doing is punishable by law ? They do know that; yet they do what they do. There are already laws regarding theft, corruption, murder etc. still do you think it's stopping people from doing that. How is this different from that? Laws has never prevented people from carrying out crime. Not here and not anywhere in the world. And believe it or not we are part of this world. Even though many of us are completely ignorant about it.

Many people will start pointing out to European countries as an example. But sorry you can't do that, you can compare Denmark or Sweden or those countries just considering the population difference let alone literacy and all the other good stuff. Smaller homogeneous population is always easy to manage than larger diverse population. So if you didn't know about our demography,  I think the ship in this case has sailed a long time ago. US, UK , France the countries with relatively larger and diverse population also has same issue related to murder, theft , rape etc. There are many parts even in those countries which is not safe not only for women but for anybody.

We as Indians have been sold this fake dream of a perfect society and we are ""developing"" towards it. The government is gonna give you Jobs, education, healthcare and everything. The government will take care of us and when anything bad happens blame the government. There are some cases where we can blame them but not everything. Certainly not this, You wanna ask government why this happened ? You are stupider than you think. 

The real culprits are the parents of the (I wanna use boys/people but frankly that humanizes them, I don't think they deserve to be). They are around 20-25. So why did the mother failed to give her child any compassion? why did the father not teach his son what's right or whats wrong? And the main culprit; why did our education fail in producing quality humans? Until you don't ask the right question and to the right people; nothing changes.  

The only thing that could have prevented this was parents and education. They failed; not anyone else.",1575291588.0

* We will analyze and use the data to publish the list of suspected rapists. If anyone feels that a rapist is missing in the list, you can anonymously get them added.

* The police will thereafter arrest all suspected rapists and due process will be followed in the court of law. It is upto the rapist to prove otherwise.

* The Government understands that women may have problems due to them being victims of rapes more often. Hence special fast track courts would be set up to provide them justice. Here we will assume their innocence unless proven otherwise.

* Some anti-women groups would call the above as specifically calling all men rapists. It is not. It is just providing quick access to justice to women.

* No non rapist would be affected by the process.",1577985394.0

They fucking tortured a girl (Anu Dubey) who was protesting against rapes. They seized her placard.

It's been one news after the other about multiple women getting raped, and some were set on fire after being raped. What the hell is going on? We are told not to go out late at night because of the fear of being raped. We are told not to speak up if a man catcalls out of the fear of retaliation. We are told to dress modestly, because again...rape or molestation. We are told not to go anywhere alone, to keep an eye on our drinks at bars, not be ""bold"", not have multiple sexual relationships. When do I live my life? Will I live my entire life like this? Will I lie on my death bed thinking that I basically lived a life out of fear trying to follow rules that were made up by the patriarchy God knows when and because the justice system is inefficient? If I have a daughter, is this what she will have to live through not because all men are the same, but because God knows what if she trusts the wrong man or someone takes advantage of her?

Women have been raped even while being accompanied by a man, so there goes the logic of ""take someone with you so you won't be raped."" Young women, babies, middle-aged women, and old women have been raped...proving time and time again that age is not a factor. Most of these women were wearing traditional clothes which checks the SANSKARI NARI box, yet they were raped. Women have been raped by their own relatives. Women have been raped by politicians. Women have been raped by policemen. Police and politicians have refused to take rapes seriously. ""Come after you have been raped"". Women have committed suicide because the police refused to file a complaint. SO WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE???? WHAT is it that will make all these politicians sit up and think women are human beings too? That women are fucking tired of protesting and living like a second-class citizen that nobody cares about? And NO ""men will be men"". Women are just as interested in sex contrary to patriarchal belief, yet you don't see us out and about raping men do you?

Why are these politicians shying away from making rules that hand out strict punishments irrespective of their age? Why is our usually-talkative Prime Minister silent? Why are juveniles getting away with a few years? Rapists should be sentenced to death. If someone is capable of putting an iron rod up a person's private parts and/or setting them on fire and/or raping them, they deserve to have their balls chopped off and hung in public. Why are these cases taking years and years to convict rapists in cases with clear evidence? What's it going to take? I am so fucking tired.",1575901841.0

174,174,The underlying problem behind incidents such as Priyanka Reddy's rape and murder incident,113,e50x7f,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e50x7f/the_underlying_problem_behind_incidents_such_as/,54,"So... I don't usually peruse social media and when I do, I don't come out and talk about important issues. Mostly because I tend to keep to myself and I don't want to invite any trouble. I spent a good one hour staring at a blank wall, debating back and forth whether I should say this. Reddit is the one social media account that I have and now that I did decide to say this... I'd like to talk about the Priyanka Reddy rape and murder incident.

It is a god awful tragedy that should've never happened, but it did. Everyone is angry and frustrated, wishing they could do something about it. Many have lobbied hard and protested for swift justice and demanded a death sentence. Alternatively, many others have also argued that a death sentence is not sufficient and have suggested crueller alternatives. Okay. Understandable. But to what end?

All of us are reacting to an issue after the fact and it is easy to get carried away by the initial rage of it and feel angry and irritated and frustrated. But very few of us are actually trying to identify and acknowledge the underlying problem here. Honestly, I see a lot of parallels between this and the mass shooting issues that America is facing right now. An isolated incident happens. Everyone gets enraged, they get mortified, they get shocked, distraught, horrified, all the applicable words in the dictionary. They demand justice for the victim. Some sort of appropriate justice is dealt. Things go quiet for a while, the issue has been pushed aside and the vicious cycle repeats itself again with a new incident. Nothing has changed!

Once I got over the initial rage, I took a step back to look at the facts so far. While there's no denying that almost the entirety of the blame is on the perpetrators themselves, a small but significant portion is also on us as a society. Let me explain. From what contradicting news sources I could find, I gathered that three out of the four perpetrators are just 20 years old. Young adults, yes, but also basically kids. They belong to an easily influenced and impressionable youth demographic. The same impressionable youth that politicians would exploit for their own personal gain. Their backgrounds suggest that they have no prior criminal history nor is there any evidence pointing to a criminal character. So then, why did they do it? What drove them to go from being absolutely normal human beings with absolutely normal lives to committing an extremely heinous crime? Was it the alcohol? Hardly. It wasn't a spur-of-the-moment impulsive action either. It was a long drawn out series of events spanning several hours. At any point, did they not stop and question their actions or its consequences? Because no one taught them right from wrong, and because they were misguided youths, and because their feeble minds were swayed into making a series of wrong decisions, not only was one life ruined but a total of five. Everything could have been prevented, but now there are five deaths and five grieving families undergoing an emotional trauma that should befall no family. Not to mention, an entire nation is shook because of the incident. Five people who could've gone on to live long fulfilling lives. But instead, all of them ended in tragedy.

Don't get me wrong. I don't deny the fact that they deserve what is coming to them for their actions. The damage has been done and their chapter will come to an end with their death sentences. But what about the people out there who haven't actually done anything but still have malintent in their minds? Surely, there are people right now plotting and planning for some future crime. Young misguided youths just like these four perpetrators. The blunt truth is, we as a society are birthing them due to sheer negligence. For starters... A majority of us don't want to talk about sex education. Some of us avoid it like the plague and there is a serious lack of awareness. Sex itself is a taboo subject. Many parents don't want to talk to their children about this ""sinful"" topic. They show a lack of concern for their children's well-being, and they don't want to address issues of mental health. Many girls grow up thinking their periods are a disease, shameful at what they do every month. And many boys are raised distantly from girls, forbidden to interact with them, so much so that they don't see them as fellow human beings anymore. And because the parents and the rest of society are seriously neglecting to guide them and educate them, this is the consequence of all that negligence. But many of us don't want to address or even acknowledge these faults. Hypocrisy runs deep!

So, what's the solution? Well... I don't know. I'll be honest. I don't know. However, I'm not here to try and provide a solution by saying all of this. I am trying to highlight and get people to acknowledge the underlying problem here, so that we can work together to figure out a solution and fix it. In doing so, we not only prevent innocent people from becoming future victims but also misguided youths from becoming future criminals.

Please don't upvote my post and move onto the next post. I don't want your upvotes. Share this information and spread awareness so that this sort of tragedy can be prevented in the future.

Also... Please note that if you have racist things to say in the comments, please go and be racist elsewhere. India is a country with its own problems, just like every other country in the world. We are trying to fix those problems. There are no lesser thans or worse thans here.",1575330799.0
175,175,"The boys involved in the locker room chat definitely need to face consequences in spite of being minors, but that won‚Äôt solve the underlying issue. Unless sex education is made a serious part of the school curriculum.",229,gdw4hy,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gdw4hy/the_boys_involved_in_the_locker_room_chat/,104,"I recently learnt about the locker room chat incident and have fairly been able to wrap my head around the situation after being OOTL. I am appalled at the apathy and lack of respect towards women in general, especially when that generation is supposedly to be the future of the country. These boys need to face consequences although I am doubtful about how successfully they will catch the most responsible individuals. 

But, even this would be a reactive measure. Will this really stop the possibly countless other children that are involved in such conversations? Maybe to a degree, maybe some will distance themselves out of guilt, shame, fear or realization, but the larger picture is that this will not tackle the problem at its core.

I am a guy brought up in Delhi myself, and I know first hand how boys at that age could behave. But this has become a norm solely due to the fact that the school syllabus lacks sex education. When I was a kid, we brushed by the topic of sex in our biology class, and we would giggle at the very mention of it and I am myself guilty of this. I guess 13 year old me couldn‚Äôt get his head around the fact that this is a very serious topic that will be huge part of his adult life and would also define a large part of who he is as a human being. And this is the problem. The prudish nature of the policy makers and the older generations is creating a very toxic atmosphere. I guess most of you can derive your own conclusions from the above but here are my points about why it is necessary to include sex education in the curriculum:

1. Sex education doesn‚Äôt just teach you about the physical act of sex.

2. It teaches you about the various methods of protection not just against pregnancies but STDs.

3. It teaches you about consent and that no means no.

4. It is also teaches you how to behave and respect boundaries with other people, but most importantly with the other gender. And this is not just during sex, this directly influences you to respect boundaries during other interactions.

5. It teaches you the sexual problems and, to a degree, social problems the other gender faces.

6. It can also counsel you if you are having problems due to sex, or if you are frustrated due to the lack thereof.

7. And lastly it teaches you that people, regardless of gender, are individuals with their own aspirations and dreams, and that the opposite gender is not just an instrument to gratify your sexual needs.

I thought these off the top of my head while I am lying in bed trying to doze off, so I am sure there might be quite a few more. The embarrassment that people feel while discussing sex needs to go. I know that most of you guys know this already but this is not true for a huge chunk of the population, but why be embarrassed to discuss something that is so natural to most species on the planet. 

The fact is that the younger generation is getting comfortable with sex, but on their own terms, without a lack of direction. And this is the problem. If children are eventually going to learn about such an important topic as sex, why not guide them in the right direction.

So being a prude, denying the access to this, sometimes in the name of culture, and shirking responsibility is a very naive approach and this needs to change earnestly. There really needs to be push for this ASAP, and policy makers need to acknowledge the fact that this is a problem. 

I am not trying to vilify anyone. I know that not everyone agrees with that abhorrent mindset, but we really need to acknowledge the problem of we want to tackle it. If in your family your kid is misbehaving, you as a parent will be responsible for that, and that analogy holds here as well. Also please never try to downplay this with the statement that ‚Äúboys will be boys‚Äù. I hope that in a few years from now, when people use that phrase, they would mean it as a compliment instead.

Edit: 1. I would also like to emphasize again that by sex education I don‚Äôt mean a course where they teach you about the physical act of copulation. That already exists in our biology courses. What we need is a well built and well researched subject that tackles most, if not all, direct and indirect topics pertaining to sex, which I have already listed out.",1588707310.0

It's natural for the movement to have some criticism and strong resistance indeed. But problem arises when the extremists are hijacking the movement to promote their personal agenda like with every other movement. Social media is fuelling the rise of extremists everywhere, from politics to religion to individual movements. Extremists appeal the masses, their fiery content spreads faster than coronavirus on the social media platform. 

I am a Man and a Feminist, I believe in equality. I have worked with organisations against domestic abuse of women, I even refain from using the Nazi word to refer to the extreme feminists. But the recent #boislockerroom controversy saw posts of such extreme feminists with their generalized derogatory view about a particular gender and populist rhetoric like ""Oppressors don't deserve equality"", ""Equality for oppressors is a form of oppression"" mixed with their own personal biases and agenda. 

Now don't get me wrong here, I am not shooting down claims of these people, I absolutely have no idea what they have been though. But it's merely my observation how social media is spreading views of such extremists. Such posts tends to attract more people, it tends to create divide amongst others (When my female friends shared posts like ""Even you are responsible because you benefit from the system and you don't prevent others from enforcing it""), It helps to propagate exactly the same thing they are fighting against, Patriarchy. With the news of how ""Rape Snapchat chat"" was all fake it's going to create a much wider divide and make it easier for their misogynistic counterparts to further strengthen Patriarchy.",1589184169.0

Here, for your entertainment, are some of the craziest tales spun by the opposition's propaganda factory. And the truth.

**What about the viral video where Rahul Gandhi speaks about ‚Äòaloo ki factory‚Äô?**

Context is everything. That bit was a fragment of an interaction with distressed farmers in Uttar Pradesh. One farmer suggested a potato chip factory in the region, to which Mr Gandhi responded. The entire interaction is presented here (comment in question at 1.22) Farmers‚Äô concerns and agricultural policy are clearly not as ‚Äòviral‚Äô as a sentence plucked out of context by an opposition more comfortable with jeering than thinking.

[https://vimeo.com/300017070](https://vimeo.com/300017070)

**Wait, another aloo question. Why did he talk of a machine that would turn potatoes into gold (aloo se sona niklega)?**

That is indeed a ludicrous thing to say. Only, Rahul Gandhi didn‚Äôt make that claim, he was making fun of the prime minister‚Äôs outrageous promises. Again, a fragment of the speech was deviously presented by the BJP‚Äôs team, to suggest the very opposite. Here is the full video, for those who care about the truth.

[https://vimeo.com/300018438](https://vimeo.com/300018438)

**Why did he claim that connecting MRI machines would improve healthcare in India?**

In a question about healthcare, one of the the ideas that Mr Gandhi referred to was the internet of things. Connecting devices like MRI machines, CT scanners and other equipment through the cloud and analysing their findings is an important part of diagnosis and care. This data-driven approach is the future of healthcare, and it is already a reality in many parts of the world. So Rahul Gandhi was referring to a global trend that his critics may not yet be aware of.

For those who want to know more, here is a handy article from the [Economist](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/02/01/a-revolution-in-health-care-is-coming)

**What in the world did he mean by escape velocity of Jupiter?**

Rahul Gandhi was speaking about the extra push needed for Dalits to reach the same footing as others. As a socially disadvantaged community, it takes greater effort for them to shake off the downward pull of their environment. Just like it takes greater energy to escape Jupiter‚Äôs gravitational field than that of earth.

Escape velocity is also a commonly used term in social research ‚Äì take this example from [Harvard Research](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/lkatz/files/aer.103.3_fryer_katz_pp_2013_all_0.pdf)

It‚Äôs not that hard to understand, even for the BJP.

**Why did he say ‚Äòpoverty is a state of mind‚Äô?**

Rahul Gandhi had said that apart from material deprivation, poverty is also a state of mind. This is borne out by social science research on the psychological effects and insecurities created by scarcity and precarity.

Media headlines mangled his words to suggest he said poverty is only a state of mind. As usual, the BJP cried hoarse. The Dalit Resource Centre of the Gobind Ballabh Pant Social Science Institute, where Rahul Gandhi made the statement, clarified the facts, and most newspapers carried corrections the next day, but the damage was done. Deliberately. Read: [Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/rahul-spoke-about-poverty-of-thought-clarifies-host/story-ERPthC1QhVxjxuZM0ZWgMM.html), [Indian Express](http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/institute-quotes-rahul-gandhi-as-saying-poverty-is-just-a-state-of-mind/1152249/)

**Why did his ‚Äúwoke up this morning, last night‚Äù go viral?**

Because to err is human, and to mock is the BJP. It was a slip of the tongue. Happens to everyone, especially those whose words are constantly watched.

This list is likely to keep growing. Lies will continue being generated, because the only limits are in the BJP‚Äôs imagination. Some of these allegations, though, are more serious and unconscionable than others:

**What is the truth about the Sukanya rape case?**

This charge, cooked up by political opponents and peddled on foreign websites, was struck down by the Supreme Court of India for being ‚Äúwithout substance and without an iota of evidence‚Äù . Not only that, the court heavily fined the petitioners for causing reputational damage to Rahul Gandhi. Half of that penalty was due to Rahul Gandhi, and half to the woman who they claimed had been raped. Read: [NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rape-allegations-defamed-rahul-gandhi-says-supreme-court-cbi-may-explore-foreign-angle-502158), [Mint](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/JXeMExPzO8PeL9k7S7m1FI/Supreme-Court-dismisses-case-against-Rahul-Gandhi.html)

That this malicious lie continues to lurk in a right-wing echo-chamber shows that some people are impervious to the truth and contemptuous of due legal process. They will go to any length to discredit someone they don‚Äôt like.

**Was Rahul Gandhi detained in Boston with drugs?**

No. Those sharing these fantasies, without offering even a shred of evidence, are obviously smoking something strong.

It might be due to the more exposure of social media and internet that the news which earlier used to be restricted to particular cities or states is now known all over the country and the world too. 

Regarding a solution for reducing the rapes, one of the effort should be that we need to think about the root cause of the same to try to reduce the sexual assaults and trying to figure out the problem before it occurs. Instead we are just getting hyper about some cases and then cheer the unlawful acts of encounters, and then move on to the next big case.

As I stated a few days back, Nobody stops to sit and study the accused psychologically. What caused them to do it? What was going on in their minds before they carried out these heinous cruelty? Why did they think they would get away with it? If not why did they still agree to go ahead with the plan? What‚Äôs their upbringing background? What‚Äôs their mental state? What‚Äôs their end goal?

I agree the rapists should be punished according to law, but we also need to invest in studying their physiological mindset to have a better understanding of their state of mind so that we can try to get to the roots of the problem and try to fight it there.

Also we need to question the police, judiciary and the government for not doing their work as expected. Even in the Hyderabad case, the police refused to act quickly when the family first approached with a complaint. Also in the latest Unnao case, the rape occurred in December 2018 and the victim went to the cops the next day. But the case wasn‚Äôt filed until March 2019 and one of the rapist surrender until August 2019. The other suspect was still absconding even until September 2019.

Nobody is collectively questioning the police or the politicians. In the end we are becoming more numb because of so much exposure to the flooding of rapes news reports around the country. I just hope that we don‚Äôt become so accustomed to it that we stop batting an eye for such future news, and instead try to work at stopping the assaults by recognizing the problems and also by educating empathy, kindness, respect and common sense into the younger ones from childhood.

The MeToo movement also almost died down in India and nothing major came out of it. We are too powerless currently and too bigoted as humans.

This decade will anyways be ending with a very sad state due to the rapes and assaults which happened and it is a shame for our nation.",1575831027.0

229,229,Opinion : The rape problem has a much deeper cause - from a man's perspective,51,e5v6f1,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5v6f1/opinion_the_rape_problem_has_a_much_deeper_cause/,28,"I will take an example of story, I will try to keep the story as close to reality as possible so we can all relate to it somehow.

This is the story of an Indian boy - Manav. Manav was born in a small town to a middle class family. He went to a private school which was also his town's most famous school. He studied there till class X. All his classmates were more or less same from the nursery to class X. His class strength was 38 - 30 boys, 8 girls. Now, in his time there was a certain stigma - boys and girls that talk and interact were considered impolite and bad students both in school and otherwise. This was not limited to school classroom, everywhere in town you would see what society called 'good' men staying away from women, not talking to any other woman except perhaps their wives and sisters. Same stigma for women, the classic Indian rules. In fact, the stigma reached to the classroom from outside. Thus you could commonly see that girls occupied there separate rows in class, and neither party (girls - boys) ever initiated a casual talk. Consequently, Manav never had any real female friends in his school. But he was not unhappy about it, for it made him a 'good' student in society. So far so good, no problems apparent.

Now Manav left the old school and went to prepare for competitive exams following the sheep. The situation was but unchanged. His class strength was now 150 - 120 boys, 30 girls. The stigma prevailed. Manav seldomly talked with girls, as a matter of fact he no longer knows how to talk to a girl which adds to his shyness towards girls. Did I tell that Manav was out of his small town, yes he is now in a mid tier city close to his town. Manav still did not mind, but from inside his hormones were kicking in. He stared at girls (albeit not in a perverted manner) but the stigma!

Fast forward few years, Manav is now in a college in a big city. His college is reputed and attracts students from all around the central India. The stigma is very reduced now. Manav often saw love couples roaming around which at the beginning he foudn rather awkward but has since then got used to it. But the years of staying away from girls has taken a toll on him. He does not know how to talk to a girl, how to start a conversation. And oh the ratio has not improved either, it is still 1:4 in college also. Manav still has no female friends but neither do his other male friends. But it all right, Manav thinks, girls are not the end of life.

Now I never really said that Manav was a good student. Nope, he is just your average guy. Barely got 80% in XII to get a seat in his college, and in the college he has had all sorts of intoxicants. Manav has also been well introduced with porn. Having not had a female friend is his all teenage years, Manav has never really known a girl. You don't blame him right now, do you? But watching porn had a serious impact on him, this was his first introduction to what girls are - sex objects. Yes, why not. Porn is misogynistic and sexist, yes, but having not had a real female friend to understand girls at all, how could he have known otherwise? How could he know that girls are not just waiting for a boyfriend? It is all he has ever known about girls in his entire life so far. He thinks he is getting the real sex education now. But oh wait, the stigma! It forbids having such views about women, so right, Manav has been suppressing them for a long time already (when do you think he was first introduced to porn?). Until one day, he decides, fuck society. He decides to have a girlfriend (this time with perverted intentions). But what did I say about him having lost the ability to talk with girls, yup. You have guessed the outcome. No success.

What happens afterwards is not important. It depends on a lot of factors. My aim with this story was to convey the message of Manav's internal struggle (which is not visible). You can not expect a man who has never known a girl in his life respect women when all he has ever seen is misogynist and sexist angles. I am not blaming porn here. I just used it to steer the story, you can replace porn with any other misogynist encounter in his life - movies, street gangs, whatever. The final outcome remains same. The conclusion of this story is not to ban porn or isolate the boy, no! Manav was damaged from porn because that is the only knowledge he has about girls. The stigma is the root cause here. The sex ratio fuels it. We as a society should stop treating girls as only marriage material or some form of pavitra devi. Having a female friend to talk to and understand is very crucial for healthy development, not to mention the complete lack of sex ed in Manav's life.

Yes you may treat the symptom by beating the shit out of him once he does anything terrible but that is just one Manav right. All the other boys are going through the same phase and there is no telling when a new one will pop up. You just need a guy who is not scared of the system and you have a new rapist. To truly cure the disease we need a total change in our society, I am advocating for that change through this story.

Ofcourse, Manav is not justifiable. A grown up man should have brain to think what is right and what is wrong without any aid from past experience. But... critical thinking, my friend, there is an utter disgusting lack of it all over the world (more so in India where you have to learn so many society rules none of which make any sense).

Note sure I was properly able to convey my message or not. Thanks for reading. Would love to hear any criticism at all.",1575470102.0

233,233,Rape and India - an opinion,78,e5nwuc,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5nwuc/rape_and_india_an_opinion/,25,"Rape has been pretty much a part of our culture. Yes, many of you will scoff at me for including rape as part of Indian culture. Many of you will say that culture is different and the violent and despicable act of rape cannot be part of any culture.

But my take on rape is that it is not something new and alien. It has not started happening in just the last decade. It has started appearing as news. That is new. If Indian films can be considered a reflection of Indian society, I grew up seeing implied rapes on the silver screen from my infancy. I grew up knowing and thinking- Rape is bad. But men do it just the way they drink, smoke and play cards. Most of the films had at least one sequence of ijjat lootna. In every other film, the sister or mother of the protagonist would be raped. It was an uneasy, uncomfortable, repulsive witnessing of an act that made little sense to me. I had to watch at least a couple of dozens of times every year as my parents took me with them to watch films. Normal Bollywood films in a normal cinema hall and my parents along with hundred of adults watched insinuated rapes, without a flinch, with their son or daughter next to them. But I would be shocked if you are shocked to know that these my parents never uttered the word Sex in front of me, in their lifetime. I have sanskari parents. Our sanskar may not allow us to show a film that depicts the sexuality of a widow but our sanskar has no problem with the depiction of the violent act of rape. Our sanskar also does not conflict with our watching a scene of rape on the silver screen, the same sanskar that kept kiss at bay from films for decades.

But that is just silver screen. Aren't those sanskari in the panchayat who prescribe rape for settling a dispute over the property? We hardly care about the allegations of rape by Indian security forces in North East and Kashmir. Isn't the rape of Dalit women to punish and subjugate Dalits a part of the sanskar that has been inherited by generations? Child marriage was a part of our culture, not too long ago. Even today, you would find thousands of underaged girls being married off. We were fine with rape. We may be a conservative society. We may not utter the word Sex. We may frown at the public display of affection, Valentine's day celebration, hugs and kisses. But we are fine with rape. We are so fine with rape that marital rape does not even exist.

It is not that the police are corrupt because of which they treat the rape survivor in the most ungracious way. Rape is something that hota hai. Hota aa raha hai. No need to make a hue and cry about it. Go to the next police station. It is not just rape, everything that happens around it oozes of misogyny and sexism. We cannot deny that our culture is rather sexist and misogynistic. Yes, we do pray to devis and all that but Sabarimala is forbidden for women in menstrual age. Menstruation itself has a negative connotation to it in society. Malnutrition in the girl child, lesser education and employment among women, human trafficking, female foeticide. In the last 100 years, we have reached here, from a society that used to burn widows. So, yes we are less misogynistic than what we were then but we are misogynistic as a society nonetheless. And so one says that the girls should stay at home after so and so hours. If the person would not have been sexist the person would have applied the same rule to a boy. I am hearing since my childhood - Gharelu auratein itne raat ko baahar nahin nikalti. But what about the gharelu mard?

A predominantly sexist and misogynistic society has many symptoms. It is not possible to jot them down in a short write up. But I guess one would get the point that a culture that even now is openly practising dowry, is a deeply sexist society and patriarchal society. A sexist and patriarchal society has its roots of insensitivity towards rape rather deep. No wonder that 2 finger test is still in practice. No wonder it takes years to get justice for rape survivors, so small is the rate of conviction, so many rapes go unreported. There is a genuine apathy towards the rape survivors. There is a general apathy towards women. There is a genuine bias towards male child. In such a society, rape is not a disease but merely the symptom of the diseases of sexism and misogyny. It is our cultural problem.",1575436967.0

I've been lurking on this sub for the past week and seen people mention Education, culture and various other reason that lead up to such horrifying cases. Yes , what people are saying is true. But the Other Elephant in the room in this discussion that's been heavily ignored is **INDIAN CINEMA INDUSTRY**. I can't help but think that all this stuff happens is because 95% of the Movies that are released are either Total bullshit or totally misunderstood by the larger public who can't differentiate between Fantasy and Reality.  

In Indian Films, The Focus is always on the MC. I mean yeah sure that's what the main factor that contributes to the plot. BUT ... The Focus on the MC is so much that the side characters are literally useless, including the hero's waifu. All he has to do is beat up a bunch of thugs armed to the teeth while making sure he looks majestic and ... *Voila! ,* the Heroine gets wet. Indian films always portray the Heroine as a ***meek, easy to impress and*** ***MADE FOR HERO*** type character.  The Problem lies here. Just beat up thugs and give a cheesy speech to her parents to get her LOVE ( because c'mon the hero ain't got time for having a decent job and shit, jut be C O O L and watch her parents give up a bride from AmErIcA to you, The C O O L E R bride ) .          

In movies , whenever the MC falls in love, he sometimes follows the heroine everywhere, and when she notices and questions why , he already proposes her and BOOM , they fall in love like there ain't no tomorrow. It may look acceptable on screen because we're looking at it from the point of view of MC . But that's not how it works in reality . Obviously it's not going to work, And we've seen how short tempered people are, they will go on a rampage if things don't go their way. Yeah ,okay all I said as of now most of the guys here on the sub agree on. BUT who would be foolish enough to believe that? BUT PEOPLE DEEP INSIDE DO!. 70% of the population would definitely take lessons from Bhai rather than Reality. People WORSHIP these guys .They go to Temples to pray so that their favorite actor's movie may be a huge success ( Cringe ) , and go as far as to COMMIT SUICIDE if they're convicted of any crime. Heck, Look at all the WEEBS who think Japan is the greatest country on the planet. they're definitely smart enough not to be fooled by stupid and  clich√©ed tricks and they STILL think Japanese women are easy ,traditional and love white men. There's a TON of things I wanna rant about but that's not what I want the post to be about. 

My point is, Media is probably the most powerful weapon in the world right now , probably even powerful than nukes. **What do you guys think?**  I'm definitely not the first guy here to realize this. We obviously know the Indian Media is doing nothing but adding fuel to the fire. In what ways can we make people aware of all the bullshit that happens on screen should stay on the screen? Because I'm a first year in college and I've seen a vast majority of the boys in my class think girls are easy and they'll be in a relationship by the end of the year. And this is a very R E P U T E D college in Bengaluru mind you ,not the one situated in some remote area. Most of us are well and aware on what's real and what's not. How do you think we make people realize TRULY that that's not how reality works?, From what I think if we can get the Media right, which Majority of the Population ( ( Nah probably everyone ) actually gives a fuck about, I think we can reduce the severity of this matter.   


**TL;DR : Indian Media Portraying women as easy ,meek and characterless in R O M A N C E genre is convincing majority of the horny population that that's how women ARE. And when things don't go the way like in the movies, leads to things like Rape and murder.**",1575333474.0

Just finished ‚ÄúPaatal Lok‚Äù on Amazon Prime, and I can‚Äôt get it out of my head. This post has spoilers, so if you haven‚Äôt seen it,  stop reading here.

In one scene DCP Bhagat says that ‚ÄúWhat we call system is not garbage but a well-oiled machinery. If you resist it, you will be easily replaced‚Äù. According to me, this quote sums up the entire series for me.

Be it the lead Hathiram Chaudhary , Ansari or even Tyagi , we all are merely the small parts in the whole system where each of us , be it good or bad,  just playing our role. While much has written about excellent performances in this series, my aim through this post is to appreciate how real it seems when you start relating it with the news we read about every day from gang-rapes of young dalit women to arrest of gullible criminals. Is it the truth which we read everyday or we are just reading someone‚Äôs version, which may be fabricated to suit his/her agenda. It is disturbing to find out that we may never know the backstory of the person. 

It made me question my own notions about morality and what is a crime and what isn‚Äôt. For example, when Tope Singh takes a stand against the Upper-caste abusers in his village, is he a criminal or a just a common man who has decided not to take it anymore and resist.

Another interesting character arc for me was Hathiram Cahudhary, who is a meek police officer who has accepted himself as a loser but in the end becomes a confident , risk taking  person who decides to go against everyone in power who are at the top rung of so-called system.

But my favourite character in this series was Ansari. His attitude of being the right guy even after facing discrimination everyday because he is a Muslim, will forever inspire me. To sum up, in the world of Sanjeev Mehras, always try to be Ansari.

I would appreciate your thoughts about this series.",1590098730.0

You may disagree with what I say, but please do read this once and then maybe leave a comment on whether you agree or not, and why. Just don't downvote the post and fuck off, let's have a proper discussion. Here goes.

Those boys have a depraved mentality. They are sick and I hope they grow the fuck up, they are sixteen and seventeen, for fuck's sake. I think a sixteen-year-old is in the tenth standard. I remember my tenth. I was surrounded by boys like that, maybe even some girls. And I am from one of the better schools in Delhi. This kind of shitty talk was not super common, but it was still there. It mostly originates from the biggest troublemakers in class, they all used to be a part of a group. Like attracts like, I guess. They talked shit about girls, there was objectification and very inappropriate language. They even talked shit about teachers and it infuriated me. They used to talk like that every day. Their group reinforced such behaviour. They were carefree and arrogant. I maintained my distance from them, but I don't think I would call them as bad as rapists or criminals. I don't have any interaction with those kids from my school now, so I don't know if they matured, but I sure hope they did.

The point is, kids in high school are fucked in the brain. They don't think twice before spewing shit. But they say shit because they don't think there will be repercussions. They would not dare say that shit to a girl's face when repercussions are guaranteed. They don't mean half of the shit they say. Those boys in the group chat did not send inappropriate DM to girls. They did not harass any girl. They said horrible shit amongst themselves because they thought it was okay. But as far as I am aware, everything was inside that group chat. I am not sure if they exchanged ""morphed"" photos of underage girls, but if they did, then it probably qualifies as a criminal offence and they are rightfully fucked. But from the screenshots that I saw, they were exchanging fully clothed photos of girls. Why is that a problem? People objectify celebrities, is that okay? Celebrities get paid to be objectified, is that okay?

Also, just for the record, **the separate Snapchat incident where someone said they will ""rape"" someone, was completely wrong**. Conspiring harm upon someone is not okay, and I think legal action has been initiated against him.

We need to understand that thinking and saying are NOT the same as taking action. Having a depraved mentality is not a crime, taking action on it is. Condemn the mentality, but saying something that you find offensive is not a crime. You don't jail a paedophile for being attracted to kids, you jail them for acting on that desire. There are porn subreddits and porn videos where horny people will comment nasty shit, but it's all a fantasy, a desire, and nothing else. If someone likes crime or action movies, it does not mean they are capable of committing that crime or beating people.

Moving on to why a teenager would feel the need to say shit like that, it takes us to the biggest issue at hand‚Äìhow we can change this mentality of objectifying people, especially women, as a society. It didn't start with this group chat nor would it end with them. I used to think good education will solve these fundamental issues, but I am not so sure now. This is what we should be talking about instead of just shaming those pricks.",1588632722.0

0,0,Season 3 Thoughts,22,gmfkcm,girls,https://www.reddit.com/r/girls/comments/gmfkcm/season_3_thoughts/,9,"Hope I'm not spamming, but I'm watching on acceleration because Amazon Prime won't be streaming Girls for much longer so I'm trying to watch a season a day. I've been enjoying reading your opinions!

Some thoughts I jotted down as I watched each episode.

**Episode 1 - Females Only**

* Amy Schumer to Hannah in regards to her appearance - ‚ÄúDid you leave in a rush?‚Äù With Ray‚Äôs chuckling in the background, priceless!
* J‚Äôadored that whole Natalia and Amy Schumer scene! What a rush! I‚Äôm grinning from ear to ear here. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna end up with a baby you don‚Äôt know how to care for.‚Äù Adam deserved ALL of that. Poor baby.
* Mmmkay, so this is the darkest timeline for Shoshanna.
* Mindy: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never worn a scrunchie in my whole life‚Äù Jessa: ‚ÄúYou want to wear them though.‚Äù Jessa was an absolute animal during those group sessions (and I secretly loved it).
* Well, now I want to know what Adam makes out of papier mache. Why so secretive Hannah?
* WOW. Jessa made her own rehab support group turn against her. That‚Äôs a feat. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get her a napkin.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI appreciate your candor Adam I always have.‚Äù - Me, freaking, too, Marnie, me too.
* So Adam and Hannah are a normal couple and Hannah‚Äôs a decent friend. Interesting‚Ä¶

**Episode 2 - Truth or Dare**

* I am really loving these Shoshanna-Adam moments. What‚Äôs your favorite utensil? Is Shoshanna channeling her inner Buddy the Elf or what?
* Adam is such a buzzkill on this road trip. üòÇ I would be so annoyed with him.
* Sad, but not surprised that Jessa‚Äôs British rehab ‚Äúfriend‚Äù wanted to sleep with her. She wants a father figure so bad you can smell it through the TV.
* Aww, Jessa just wanted her friends to come and get her. Manipulative yes, but systemic of her issues.
* Did Lena Dunham get a boob job?

**Episode 3 - She Said OK**

* First, Marriage Story and now Girls, do people just love cutting Adam Driver‚Äôs hair?
* Out of all the characters, I want Ray to find love the most.
* So Adam‚Äôs sister either has rabies or is a zombie. Those are the only plausible reasons for why she bit Ray.
* Hannah‚Äôs parents are so tiny next to Adam. It‚Äôs adorable.
* Aww, Marnie trying to talk all hip and street. Don‚Äôt.
* I can‚Äôt believe that silver elf knocked down my precious Ray. Also, how? Hannah‚Äôs boss is kind of a shrimp.
* Marnie, forcing Hannah to sing on her b-day, was a dick move.
* No, no, no, no, no. Furiously shaking head back and forth. I am NOT down with that tooth necklace. That was creepy AF.
* I miss Elijah.
* Marnie‚Äôs music video‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt even know where to start‚Ä¶
* Laird is back!

**Episode 4 - Dead Inside**

* Jessa talks so much foolish crap sometimes and what‚Äôs hilarious is that she thinks she‚Äôs so wise.
* There you are Hannah! See I thought you had changed, but that same self-involved chick is still in there. Did you really think your ‚Äúe-book‚Äù would be a concern to that office at this time? Their boss just died. üôÑ
* ‚ÄúNo, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm still alive either.‚Äù - Jessa to Susan‚Äôs Mom
* RIP Laird‚Äôs turtle stuck in a pomegranate juice bottle coffin.
* I think Hannah lacks any interest in Adam. I think the reason she didn‚Äôt answer her therapist about the papier mache was because she didn‚Äôt know the answer.
* I was pretty far into this episode before I realized Jessa‚Äôs friend who had to fake her own death to get away from her wasn‚Äôt named Season but Susan.
* Ray, I am not feeling your soul patch. Shave it please!
* I can totally imagine Adam dancing like a princess for hours for his terminally ill cousin. Damn, Caroline‚Äôs a good storyteller. She had me in the first half..
* Sorry Hannah you are not as good of a storyteller as Caroline. You are not believable in your voice.
* I wasn‚Äôt a fan of Hannah making her boss‚Äôs death about her as per usual, but it didn‚Äôt really bother me that it didn‚Äôt affect her much emotionally. Better to be true to yourself than fake sadness.

**Episode 5 - Only Child**

* Only Hannah would harass a widow at her husband‚Äôs funeral.
* Hannah Horvath, family mediator? No. Just no. Not your wheelhouse, babe.
* Caroline and Adam‚Äôs sibling dynamic gives me the willies. But holy crap, can Adam Driver and Gaby Hoffman act.
* Aww, I love Marnie‚Äôs backpack kitten. (Follow Up Note: I guess kitten went bye bye like the puppies that Thomas John got for Jessa.)
* Oh my word, that meeting at the publishing company with all that fake laughing and artifice and butt kissing. I need some Ray as a palate cleanser.
* Ray acting like the magical sitar in Moulin Rouge. He only speaks the truth. Can you handle it Marnie?
* The answer was no. She fished for compliments and then screwed Ray. Which is always a super healthy way to take criticism.

**Episode 6 - Free Snacks**

* Ray, you are a gentleman and a squire and don‚Äôt you let Marnie tell you any different.
* I didn‚Äôt know that there was advertorial and editorial writing staffs at magazine. I thought that people who write ads worked at an advertising agency. This show‚Äôs proving educational.
* Being able to spit out creative ideas and workshop them in a like minded group is fun. I enjoyed that scene at Hannah‚Äôs work.
* I love how Adam‚Äôs just casually making a dreamcatcher while talking about how he purposefully screws up auditions.
* Girls has this habit of making me intrigued with a character and then showing them very little for the rest of the season. In season 1, it was Shoshanna. And now it‚Äôs Jessa.
* I like Kevin. ‚ÄúI hate your face.‚Äù I‚Äôve felt that way about some coworkers.

**Episode 7 - Beach House**

* Elijah‚Äôs BACK!!!
* Old Man Ray - oy, Elijah, don‚Äôt talk about my baby that way.
* Oh, Marnie, I feel really bad for you this episode. Elijah and his crew are being mean and Hannah‚Äôs acting like a jerk.
* That dance scene was pretty awesome.
* ‚ÄúShosh, you‚Äôre a cruel drunk.‚Äù
* Elijah‚Äôs boo can jump off a cliff. What a condescending prick.
* That whole fight scene was hella anti-climactic. We already knew all that crap about y‚Äôall. On top of that, half the actresses in that scene don‚Äôt have enough acting chops to emotionally punch you in the gut.
* This episode was heavily lauded online in reviews and I‚Äôm starting to feel like I don‚Äôt get this show. Like I get it mentally, but I don‚Äôt feel it viscerally.
* I love British shows, Masterpiece Theater, etc. that are chockfull of nuance and subtlety. I don‚Äôt need these episodes to be like Empire or This Is Us where they backhand you in the face with emotion. But I want to feel a little bit of something. Yet Girls particular brand of subtlety is just underwhelming.
* All of this bumbling trying to find my words to express how I feel is just to say everyone thought this episode was good and I thought it was pretty boring.

**Episode 8 - Incidentals**

* I love Adam‚Äôs phone call while waiting for his callback. Everybody looks like I would if I had a nose job.
* Poor Jessa, she just wants to know what you ate for dinner, Rocco!
* Yo, I had to Google Patti LuPone. Like the waitress I didn‚Äôt know what she looked like either.
* I had the biggest grin on my face watching Adam get offered that part along with his bathroom celebration.
* No, Hannah, while you are working, you do not HAVE to take a call from your boyfriend. Especially right in front of the person you‚Äôre interviewing.
* I don‚Äôt know who this Patti LuPone chick is but I‚Äôm loving her warnings about the perils of doing a Broadway show.
* Hannah about Adam ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of funny looking.‚Äù Yet he bagged Natalia so that means diddly squat. What a crappy way to talk about the man you love.
* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not what you would call a One Tree Hill fan but I have seen every episode‚Ä¶‚Äù Elijah
* They‚Äôre all enraptured with the OTH guy and not her. Hannah‚Äôs not gonna like this.
* I don‚Äôt really want to be part of the scene‚Ä¶any scene. Classic Adam.
* ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt come crying to me when Kristin Chenoweth passes out because you forgot to feed her.‚Äù - Elijah üòÇ That‚Äôs got to be the greatest sentence ever uttered.
* Oh, Jessa. You need a passion in life.
* So no one‚Äôs even remotely gonna try to stop Jessa from getting more drugs?That‚Äôs depressing.

**Episode 9 - Flo**

* Like each season‚Äôs Hannah-centric episode, I fast forwarded through most of this.
* ‚ÄúJoe has a plate in his head and you can tell.‚Äù
* I take a lot of umbrage with what Hannah‚Äôs mom said about Adam. Mainly due to her complete lack of awareness. Have you met Hannah, lady? She thought it was socially acceptable to wear a bikini while out shopping. She‚Äôs made date rape jokes in a job interview. She sleeps with teenagers. She has zero awareness of social norms/manners. She ran around a freaking graveyard. Yeah, she‚Äôs more comfortable in her skin than Adam but she‚Äôs freaking WEIRD too.
* Sticking up for Adam gets my respect. Kudos to you Hannah. I‚Äôm sure everything‚Äôs gonna go to hell in a hand basket though. The season finale is nigh and that‚Äôs when crap goes down.
* That said‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think Hannah and Adam are a good match. I‚Äôve never found them believable. Their happy moments just don‚Äôt ring true. What makes them a good fit? Where‚Äôs their connection?

**Episode 10 - Role-Play**

* Favorite Episode of the Season!
* First off, who bathes their coworker?
* How do I feel about Adam in a vest? I‚Äôm not sure.
* Marnie, I know you love to sleep with tortured artists, but please don‚Äôt sleep with Desi.
* Why does no one care about Jessa or what‚Äôs happening to her?!?
* That rehearsal scene was cringe-y and Adam was a jerk for not taking the blame for the misunderstanding. I had to rewind and go back. Adam did invite Hannah to the rehearsal and then totally flaked while she took all the heat.
* ‚ÄúWould you like Jardaniel‚Äôs drink?‚Äù (Hannah licks the rim of the glass.) ‚ÄúOh yes‚Ä¶Is there a straw?‚Äù
* That whole role-play at the bar was legit hilarious.
* That used condom is still on my mind. Did someone pick it up? And sanitize the floor? Marnie was nice enough to let you use her place - it‚Äôd be nice if you didn‚Äôt leave sex juices for her to step in.
* Adam was just playing along the whole time. I don‚Äôt think he was ever really into it. What a tonal shift from the early days. Also, he straight up got hit in the face by a stranger. Not a fun night on the town.
* Nobody likes to be called weird. It‚Äôs something you can say about yourself but stings when it comes from others. I think Hannah‚Äôs mom‚Äôs words about Adam subconsciously got to her.
* And that ending. Wow. I‚Äôve watched it a few times. You can just tell how very tired Adam is of the Hannah show.

**Episode 11 - I Saw You**

* Ray is such a good friend reading lines with Adam. I sincerely enjoy their bromance.
* Why are you showing up to Ray‚Äôs apartment, Hannah? Seriously. Give him some space.
* ‚ÄúGetting old is the pits.‚Äù
* Doesn‚Äôt Desi have rehearsals too? How can he spend so much time with Marnie?
* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all about relaxed and natural.‚Äù Are you really, Marnie? You‚Äôre the character most likely to have a stick surgically removed from her butt.
* The vibe I get from Peter and Patti is very Who‚Äôs Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
* Oh, thank goodness Hannah‚Äôs boss didn‚Äôt just let that whole outburst slide and fired her on the spot.
* ‚ÄúYes, I can alphabetize. Did someone tell you otherwise?‚Äù - Jessa, she really gets some of the best lines
* I was kind of feeling that while girl rapper.
* ‚ÄúPlease stop talking, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù Elijah to Hannah - I just want to pick him up and put him in my pocket.
* Hannah was peak awfulness tonight with the being a fake friend, taking hostage of Adam‚Äôs dinner out with coworkers. And the cherry on top‚Ä¶Who opens the door on someone having sex IN THEIR OWN HOME? Who does that? And then she has the nerve to act outraged?
* I read some comments online that Adam was being an a-hole this episode which he was a bit, but I feel like his douchiness was reactionary. It‚Äôs hard to be kind when someone‚Äôs so aggressively invading your personal space and being too clingy.
* The harder you try to hold on to someone the more they want to get away. Hannah should know this. Does she not remember early season 2, the era of Stalker Adam?
* The one thing Lena Dunham does brilliantly is self-righteousness. Those last two minutes I hated Hannah so much. ‚ÄúEverything is my business.‚Äù No, it ain‚Äôt, ho.
* I think the weirdest moment this episode is Adam wanting to get frisky after Hannah embarrassed him in front of his theater friends. For why, Adam? For. Why.

**Episode 12 - Two Plane Rides**

* Uhh‚Ä¶.I feel like Caroline‚Äôs the last person on the planet that‚Äôs mentally ready for a pregnancy.
* Jessa just gets in the most ludicrous of situations. These people find her. I‚Äôve never once had a boss ask me to help her commit suicide.
* Shoshanna‚Äôs an angry elf about not graduating. I get the desire to throw stuff and knock stuff over but that‚Äôs your stuff and you got to clean it up so‚Ä¶maybe vandalize a place that‚Äôs not your home.
* Also, her screaming I hate you at Marnie was beautiful.
* ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if writing‚Äôs something that can be taught.‚Äù - Honestly, I kind of agree, but I do think abilities can be refined.
* ‚ÄúYou guys sound like you‚Äôre really proud of me.‚Äù Who says that?
* I might need to go see a doctor because my eyes have rolled straight back into my head. Hannah‚Äôs gift is taking a special moment for someone else and making it about herself. Can‚Äôt Adam have this night?
* ‚ÄúAt intermission, you‚Äôre gonna buy me some M&M‚Äôs and we‚Äôre gonna have a chat.‚Äù - Shoshanna to Ray
* Elijah wore shorts! That‚Äôs hilarious particularly after he commented on how Ray needed a blazer.
* Desi and Marnie continues to be gross.
* Aww, Shosh. You‚Äôre breaking my heart with all this sweet vulnerability. You‚Äôre a unicorn on this show because you actually reflect and grow from your past choices.
* Another great guest star, Natalie Morales, I loved the way she shut down Marnie. Chef‚Äôs kiss.
* ‚ÄúCall 911. I don‚Äôt want to die.‚Äù Sigh of relief. I feel like helping this lady die would have just f‚Äôed up Jessa even more.
* Elijah backing dat ass up into the cast photo had me in tears.
* My stomach feels sick for Adam, but I‚Äôm so glad he and Hannah are over. I just wish it didn‚Äôt have to hurt him so. Cuz that trick ain‚Äôt even thinking about him. She‚Äôs at home smelling her acceptance letter.
* Which I think goes to show how her true love is writing‚Ä¶and herself.
* Some people aren‚Äôt meant for long-term relationships and Hannah might be one of those people. Or maybe she needs someone who‚Äôs the Peter to her Patti LuPone.
* I believe this was the episode Adam Driver used for his Emmy consideration. I wish he would have used Role-Play instead. I think that episode better showcased his talents.
* You know if Hannah doesn‚Äôt return season 4 it wouldn‚Äôt break my heart.
* Shosh was the total MVP this episode.

**Stray Thoughts on the Season**

* I find it so astounding that Lena Dunham has an actual Golden Globe for acting and Adam Driver doesn‚Äôt.
* The episodes this season don‚Äôt really relate to one another. Major stuff happens and then the next week it‚Äôs forgotten about. Overall, the season felt very disjointed with the exception of the last 2-3 episodes.
* I think Hannah thinks she‚Äôs better than Adam or at least more gifted/talented. She thinks he‚Äôs weird and calls him under the guise of ‚Äúrole play‚Äù. I think deep down she agrees with a lot of what her mom said. Also, her intimating to Patti LuPone that he wouldn‚Äôt be able to bag any girls because he was funny looking. Her refusal to accept his request for space to me wasn‚Äôt about her fear that he‚Äôd leave her. It was about her fear that he‚Äôd become more successful than her. And to some extent that his world wouldn‚Äôt revolve around her anymore. She can‚Äôt help how she feels, but staying in a relationship when you feel that way is toxic. Fortunately, they broke up, but if they hadn‚Äôt she should have ended things with him regardless.
* Can I just say‚Ä¶I‚Äôm really tired of seeing Lena Dunham‚Äôs boobs? Pull up a bed sheet, girl.
* I love the fashion on this show so much sometimes. Jessa and Shoshonna in particular have some cute outfits.
* I feel like a lot of the relationships on this show originate from ‚Äúoh, you‚Äôre here nearby, let‚Äôs bone.‚Äù There‚Äôs no emotional or mental connection. It‚Äôs all about proximity. And that‚Äôs why I think these relationships fail so spectacularly because they‚Äôre not built on anything real.
* Still have so much love for Adam, Ray, and Elijah (although he can be a mean, naughty minx sometimes). They are the bright spots of the show.
* Shoshanna soared up from the ashes in that finale. She really redeemed her character.
* Jessa - Her past is what makes me feel for her. She does a lot of crappy things but I give her a lot of leeway because she‚Äôs a very wounded person.
* If Marnie hadn‚Äôt gotten into all this Desi mess, she‚Äôd be higher up on my list. I was so excited about the potential for her and Ray, but no, she‚Äôs got to be obsessed with some mediocre artist instead.
* Hannah is the worst of the worst. It‚Äôs not all her fault. It seems she was bred for this as her mom appears to be a huge tool as well. I cannot with her self-righteousness and her self-centeredness. She literally devolved this season. She started off on such a high note and then went right back to being a crap person.
* This season had some really good moments, but I think my ranking of the seasons from best to worst is Season 2, Season 1, and Season 3.",1589882965.0
1,1,Adam is basically like every shitty boyfriend/fling you have in your life,55,fzus2l,girls,https://www.reddit.com/r/girls/comments/fzus2l/adam_is_basically_like_every_shitty/,28,"I always hated Adam. I know, that most people love him and think, that he is the best thing about that show, but imho he is an entitled asshole, but I think, Lena Dunham did a brilliant job by creating the character, because he shows us something important about our love lives / habit of choosing our partners when we are young and why we are better off without guys like Adam.

&#x200B;

I am certain, many of us have had that experience. We stumble into that guy and start dating him, mostly in our twenties. He isn't sucessful, nor especially intelligent or good looking, but he has that certain charm, that makes others and especially women completely starstruck. regular social norms don't seem to apply to him. He treats others like shit, does what he wants, but others don't seem to mind and keep up with his shit because he is oh so quirky and just one of a kind. Adam is exactly that kind of person. 

those guys mostly want to keep the relationship casual, because ""they don't want to give up their freedom"". This is at first also the case with Hannah and Adam, until they hop into a relationship out of a sudden which, when i first watched the series irritated me, because it was so abrupt and not realistic at all, but now i quite like it because it shows, what will happen, if the quirky guy that always keeps you at an arm's length and just wants a fling actually does turn into your boyfriend. That, even if this charismatic bad boy will commit, the relationship with him will still be shitty.

Adam is the epitomy of toxic masculinity. That shows itself with his actions:

\- He yells at his girlfriends

\- Stalks his ex girlfriend 

\- Steals a dog

\- Brags with his hook ups

\- Constantly breaks stuff

\- Date rapes Natalia

\-Is rude af

\- Constantly tries to discipline others

\-Moves in his girlfriend's apartment with the homewrecker he is screwing.

\- Hooks up with his ex girlfriend's best friend, even though she opposes at first, but he doesn't let go until he gets what he wants

\-Kills a goldfish

&#x200B;

Its funny, because at the same time, he comes across as so harmless and unthreatening. But I think, that is part of his appeal. All those around him think of him as this sensitive, intellectual hipster artist, when he's really just a caveman.

Yes yes, i know what you're thinking: ""But Hannah is a unbearable little shot too"" - yes she is, but that doesn't excuse Adam's behaviour nor his actions. I find it really funny, when some people really claim, that the guy is the voice of reason of the show, when he is just an entitled asshole.",1586717957.0

6,6,I think I missed what was so clever in episode 6.4. Fill me in? (Spoilers),21,5woart,girls,https://www.reddit.com/r/girls/comments/5woart/i_think_i_missed_what_was_so_clever_in_episode_64/,59,"When I read about this episode there seemed to be a consensus that the episode deftly handles to idea of coercive sex in a really clever way. That it showed the blurry areas in how a predator charms women and how it isn't so cut and dried as someone saying yes and someone saying no.

Ok, here is what I saw in this episode: Hannah nervously went over to meet a literary hero of hers. She thought his actions were scumbaggy and was disappointed because she loved his writing. He eventually explains his view of the encounter with the girl (in my opinion correctly characterizing it as an interaction where she assumed another man was not interested in knowing her more and in order to avoid grappling with that she assumed he wanted something sexual so she gave it to him.) 

Now that Hannah ""has all the facts"" (what? You don't) she sees why she was wrong, and the guy decides to placate her by pretending to care about her, allegedly as he failed to do with the other girl. 

But then... he goes right back to being a predator and a creep? As SOON as she lets her guard down, he asks her to lie in his bed with him. That's not ok. He unbuttoned his pants and pulled his dick out. That's not ok. Hannah touched his penis, but none of this narrative has shifted at all from the general common sense logic of when you are around a predator he's gonna do some predatory shit.

I feel like that moment where Hannah touched his dick is meant to convey that she had allowed herself to be coerced without realizing it but nothing in this guy's behavior was inconsistent with the way creepy assholes act. There was never any point where she should have shifted her judgment about him. Any woman with any sense would have gone ""I knew it!"" the second he asked her to get in his bed, and went off on a rant about how stupid he would have to think she was that 5 minutes of conversation would suddenly prove he was a good guy that could be trusted. Hannah didn't react as though she had participated in a coercive (but technically consensus) event either, the way she jumped up and started squealing at his dick being out - she reacted, rightfully, as though she had been assaulted.

So, please inform me, what is the clever narrative at work here? Because all I saw was a throwaway remark on ""unless you're an idiot, it's pretty easy to tell when creepers gonna creep.""  If Hannah had been the one to initiate sexual contact, I could see another layer, but she wasn't. I expected to see them showing how he manipulated her so much she thought she wanted it even though she didn't, but I do not think that was what happened. And you can't really make a point about coercion and manipulation when all you're doing is showing a guy being a predator. ",1488321290.0

It made me want to watch more. And it's never disappointed me in terms of showing these characters having very real fights and sex and making bad or stupid decisions. I relate to so much of what happens in this show. 

I'm 30 myself, and this show really helped me process and understand my own early 20s and college years and post college years, gave me new ways to think about my own shit, made me feel a sense of calm and ease with the realization that I am not the only one who doesnt know what the fuck I am doing, or where I'm going, or what my life is going to be like. Helped me forgive myself for some things I was struggling with. Helped me forgive other people for things they have done to me.

Having this show end now at these junctures, when the characters are moving from young adulthood into actual adulthood... It can't. I need it here to help me process the next phase of my life. Process the transition. Not because I look to it to tell me what to do, but because it really helps me feel less bad about things I have or havent done, mistakes I've made, people I've had and lost or hurt. Relationships and friendships that have started and ended. Jobs, strangers, one night stands, boyfriends of my friends, parents, just... everything. ",1490411528.0
9,9,Why Is Hannah the Only Girl Who Uses Condoms?,7,4tnbqe,girls,https://www.reddit.com/r/girls/comments/4tnbqe/why_is_hannah_the_only_girl_who_uses_condoms/,14,"Has anyone else noticed this? The only time I can think of where a condom was used was when Marnie specifically asked Elijah (a gay man) to use one. 

Marnie didn't use condoms with Charlie. She didn't use a condom with Booth Jonathan. Jessa didn't use a condom when she proved she was un-smote-able, and she didn't use them with Adam. I'm not sure about Shosh because I don't pay a lot of attention during her scenes, but I think she was banging some guy after Ray in his apartment and didn't use a condom. 

Particularly when it came to Marnie having unprotected sex with Charlie who turned out to be an IVDU which people did notice and comment on, it makes me wonder why there wasn't more thought put into portrayal of safe sex? Is the show deliberately saying something about this issue, or is the lack of people thinking there should be accountability for safe sex saying more about what's acceptable in our culture? There is obviously a lot of thought put into the portrayal of modern America as written on this show, yet it seems they chose to completely look the other way on this issue.",1468989025.0
10,10,Why this show is so hated on Reddit?,22,39k95r,girls,https://www.reddit.com/r/girls/comments/39k95r/why_this_show_is_so_hated_on_reddit/,39,"Everytime that i post something about ""Girls"" in the ""television"" subreddit,there is a lot of people who downvote the guys who speak good about the show and about Lena Dunham,and a lot of people who upvote the guys who speaks bad about the show and about Lena. For example,there was a guy who said that the show is awful and overrated,and that Lena was a rapist and she faked her rape...i mean,those things are awful to say! (especially the rape part,of course!) but a lot of (insensitive,i guess) people upvoted this guy. Instead,when someone tried to defend her saying that people should not say something like that without any proof,people  downvoted them without any pity. Why people on the web (and on Reddit) hates Lena and the show? Maybe it's because the ""Reddit stereotype"" (that says that Reddit is full of sterotypical sexist men that doesn't care about femminism) is true? Or it's because of the scandal about her book? Or it's simply ignorance? Why people are so mean with Lena and the show? I mean,they love Entourage (good and funny show,but also a sexist show,according to me) and they hate Girls (femminist show)?? It should not be like that. ",1434128037.0

I decided it might be useful to have one post with all sorts of reading on the scene for anyone who is still thinking about it.

Hannah's boss was so high he wasn't offended and probably won't even remember the incident. 

Still, the situation gave me an icky feeling that, when you stripped it all away, what we had here is a straight guy picking a fight with a gay guy, and throwing the first punch. Where I come from, that's gay bashing. Ray calling the guy ""the silver elf"" and ""the poor man's Anderson Cooper"" are wittier than the usual homophobic slur, but it still paints Ray in a bad light. ",1390988849.0

3,3,It's Time I finally told my Story,5,gk0h8g,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/gk0h8g/its_time_i_finally_told_my_story/,0,"Warning: This may get uncomfortable for some people, I wont describe what happened to be in the assault, but I'll go into my sex life after (or lack thereof) and that might be the things people don't want to hear, but it's important for me to say what I do say because I need to get it all off my chest.

All throughout my life I've never felt like I fit in, I was always the loaner kid and thus was also always bullied.

The bullying got worse when I entered high-school, where in gym class I was forced to sit next to this football player who kept telling me he wanted to rape me to ""show me what real love felt like"".

Everyday he and his friends who were all big menacing muscular football players chased me down because I was tiny and weak. Even in class they'd try to sexually harass me and sit next to me to annoy me and make me fear them more. They laughed at my fear, as I tried to survive, it was all a game to them.

Every time they tried to sit next to me I'd change seats and the teachers thought I was the one being mean. When they grabbed my ass in the middle of class the teachers also laughed at me for being upset with a ""friendly gesture"" (for context, I'm a make to female transgender so they thought I was a male and thus saw no problem with them doing this except for me).

I even told the principal what was going on and he did nothing to stop it. So of course the inevitable happened, one day in gym they chased me into the locker rooms and then shoved me into the showers, where they restrained (holding me down with their arms and legs) and gagged me. What I happened next I don't think I need to spell out, at least i shouldn't have to.

That day when I returned home from school, I tried to tell my mother what happened. She didn't even turn her head to look at me as I told her. I stormed off to my room and cried, my own mother didn't care that her only child had gone through hell today.

The years after were still problematic as they continued their game. Once I was in college one of them just so happened to be their too and smiled at me creepily every time they got the chance, once even telling me one day that what they did to me was only a joke.

He graduated from college and became a police officer over this district, which is why I'm not telling this to the police. That said I'm not sure if he was just one of the ones chasing me or one of the ones who did it.

To recover I tried to become more normal, given they raped me because they assumed I was gay I tried to develop a sex life afterward so I'd maybe start dating, but I couldn't. The idea of sex alone just turned me off, I didn't want anything to do with it.

Though I found something I was attracted to, fat fetishism. So I spent a while in their and discovered myself, that I was trans, that I was attracted to multiple genders, that there were multiple genders, ad then finally that I was asexual (I didn't know that word defined me until another event).

Since I saw fat fetishism as my safe haven, I got too comfortable one day and let it slip that I was raped. They first told me not to say that on this server, and I apologized. Though then they came to my DMs, first telling me to get therapy which I assume they meant in a nice way, though then they told me the words that me start to realize the group I was in wasn't good for me:

""What happened to you is perfectly normal and acceptable"", those words I'll never forget, that they told me in response to me saying I was uncomfortable about something because I was raped. To ""go cry elsewhere"" about any issues I may have.

I hope I could tell you that was the end but it wasn't. I was conversing with someone else and once they remembered I was the one who said I was raped they told me ""Do you honestly think people will care about your story"". To answer their question, no, no I don't, hence I haven't told anybody about it for 10 years. Why did I tell them, because I assumed I was in a safe place a place that could understand that I was struggling in other areas and thus came to a fetish to be able to have a somewhat normal existence.

I finally told a moderator who told me that these incidents didn't count as harassment and that eve though they hurt me they ""didn't see a problem."" Maybe with them I seemed whiny and that I wanted the bullies dealt with, but to be honest I just was hoping someone would tell me that their opinions weren't representation of the fetish as a whole, only instead they confirmed they were.

Another person eventually came to me and told me to have empathy for my attackers, to think about they ""had to put up with me"" and thus they too were suffering. That I ""deserved it"".

I tried telling some one who I thought was my friend, only for them to turn on me anzd say that about that previous person ""maybe they were on to something"" (yes they meant that towards the deserving it part and not the empathy part as I hadn't told them about that yet).

I lurked in the community for a while, only finding more messed up posts within. z guy asking how he could fatten up a roommate against her will, another saying that when a woman had a fat body that she was ""clearly asking for"" their sexual advances. Then when COVID-19 hit, they even sexualized the virus saying ""the more people she claims the fatter she gets.""

The one that made me leave as the guy who said he was turned on by a woman saying no and not consenting to nay of it (fat or sex). That her rage and screaming was sexy to him. Other users encouraged each of these and supported their predatory behavior.

I finally left, telling them I felt too uncomfortable to stay here. Though I still had one issue, I was still turned on by this stuff which I was starting to think was messed up. So I came her for help with that and you know how that story went. I am still eternally grateful for your help and still remind myself that what they do doesn't define me, I'm into this fetish for my own reasons and they are different from everyone else and that's okay.

Though I still had this idea I got from the fetish I needed to do something with, a story I had started making but could never get anywhere with because of my discomfort and realizing I was the only one who would be turned on by it. I kept wanting to make a story that could be both normal and a fetish story, something to be appreciated by the world outside of the fetish, but I realized I couldn't.

I decided to ask for help in making this character by other fat fetishists on a different server. After I explained my reason for wanting to make her fit in both in normal and fetish concepts was because ""I felt uncomfortable for a person reason I wont go into and need a break from the fetish from time to time."" they wanted to tell me to go away because ""fat fetishism is not [a] problem"" but that normal people who didn't accept it were.

This farce thrown in my face was the final straw. People in the normal world have tried to help em and seem to be more on my side that rape is WRONG, consent is NOT OPTIONAL, and that people suffering or dying is NOT SEXY. I was being accepted in other places for being ""a little strange"" that was okay to deal with as long as I kept it to myself.

So that's what I'm doing, I'm hanging out in more supportive places that want to help me through things and not hanging out with depraved perverts. I've never been happier, but still I need this chance to vent.

I've been exiled from fat fetishism and I'm proud to be here. In the words of Markiplier ""I don't wanna be free"". Everything so much better when the people you're having to talk to everyday are people who think sex is the only thing in life, and people who want to help you instead of hurt you for their own pleasure.

I feel like I'm in that episode of The Twilight Zone, ""Eye of the Beholder"". I don't see myself as beautiful all that much, but I see myself as having been surrounded by people who seem me as something that needs to be cured or fixed in someway when there is nothing wrong with me, and now they've sent me to live with the outsiders who agree that there is nothing wrong with me and who want to help me see that.

Sorry if the story disturbed you in some details, I understand now why they would be as I've seen the problem in those places. Thank you for hearing me out and if you any further help to provide below I thank you in advance because I'm willing to listen now. Thank you, for being you.",1589537669.0
4,4,What is defined as rape,8,g6ezyx,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/g6ezyx/what_is_defined_as_rape/,4,"A man can rape a woman. A woman can rape a man. A man can rape a man. But a woman can‚Äôt legally rape another woman.   
When you look up ‚Äúlesbian sex‚Äù a multitude of things pop up, like positions and tips, etc.  It has been validated. Heterosexual sex without consent is rape. Homosexual make sex without consent is rape. So why hasn‚Äôt lesbian sex without consent not rape?No matter what  gender the parties involved were, the result is the same. It still breaks you and diminishes your feeling of self worth, it still makes you feel it‚Äôs and used. When a woman is raped by another woman, she might look it up for advice only to find that it hasn‚Äôt been legally acknowledged.   
I‚Äôll give you a scenario. A little girl, only ten, is just going about her day as usual. Then it happens. She doesn‚Äôt do anything for a couple of days. Then she realizes what really happened and that it was not all normal. She feels the pain all rape victims feel, but doesn‚Äôt say anything (like too many rape victims). She learns to live with the memories and emotional agony.  Three years later, she had a flashback. So she decides to look up what could‚Äôve happened if she said something, out of pure curiosity.  Do you know what the then thirteen year old girl finds? That what happened to her, what gave her nightmares for years, what has haunted the back of her mind, isn‚Äôt even a crime.

I was that little girl.

While some might argue that it is recognized as sexual assault in certain cases, it‚Äôs not enough, not even close. So now I‚Äôm speaking out, and not asking, but demanding that woman to woman rape be legally acknowledged. Every year there are more girls old to young you have had to suffer alone with pitiful  support. The sooner we are heard, the less women who are forced to suffer in the dark.",1587639276.0
5,5,Everything is contradictory and nothing makes sense anymore,1,g6ut4e,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/g6ut4e/everything_is_contradictory_and_nothing_makes/,1,"I posted about this before but didn't include everything. I just feel like I need to talk about this somewhere without being judged.

I'm 18, male and I'm sorry if this might be a bit confusing and long but I just kinda need to type all of this out.

When I was 11 I was in the locker room after practice. There was one of the older boys (he often helped with practice) still in the room with me, that was the first time we touched each other. My parents never cared when I was home and our coach trusted him enough to leave right after practice so we often stayed a bit longer after everybody had left already. 

He was at least 18 and had a gf and he asked me a lot about girls I liked and other things. I used to not want to shower with everyone but he convinced me after a few months that it was ok. He said it all was normal but that we had to keep it a secret because his gf would be very sad if she found out and it would make him very sad. He once said that he could see that I liked it and that he would tell everyone if I told them about us and that people would know I was gay and that that's a bad thing. I don't remember everything but I know that I had to touch him and that he touched me as well. It all went on for a long time, at first I thought he was joking when he put his hand down my pants but he would later do that every time we met. There are days that I barely remember what we did but I'm sure that we did more than just touching.

I guess I downplayed most of the things I could remember and I'm not sure if I'm still downplaying them. We were 'dating' - that's at least what he would call it. It all became normal because it was a slow transition and because he always made me think it was. I still don't fully understand what happened.

I started doing drugs when I was 15. It got to the point where I tried downers and by the time I was 17 I was using regularly. I stayed at a friend's flat for a bit because of the situation at my home (my parents were neglecting us and abusive to the point where school involved authorities but they were basically useless). He was 19 (using as well), his gf was 21 or 22. I often watched TV in the living room and usually I fell asleep with the TV still on. She was the one turning it off in the middle of the night. I woke up once because someone was sitting on top of me and touching me. I didn't move because I didn't know what to do but she realised that I was awake and she said a few things to me, that I shouldn't be scared, that she really liked me and that my friend wouldn't have to know. I wasn't really feeling up to it but I don't know if I told her. I was mostly just really¬†tired. I couldn't even move my arms and I felt almost paralysed. I stayed at his place after because I had nowhere else to go. One night she joked that she was pregnant by me (I was in the kitchen eating while she entered it to get food and it came totally surprising). It made me so sick that I just left and once I was standing in front of the house I knew I that I had to find another place to stay.

I went back home eventually. I told myself that I was lucky that she was interested in me, that she didn't know how uncomfortable I was. I feel worse than I ever have and remembering/realising all of this has made it all so much harder and I just kinda don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm in a downward spiral and I hate myself so much for allowing all of this to happen and for allowing this to affect me so much. I kinda blame myself and sometimes it feels like these things didn't even happen. I'm a mess, all my emotions are contradicting themselves and there are so many thoughts. Idk, I'm just overanalyzing all of this without wanting to come to a solution and this has been going on for way too long. Nothing even feels real anymore because I'm rationalizing it too much.",1587704342.0
6,6,Life Years After,4,g9zhqn,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/g9zhqn/life_years_after/,1,"Hi, My name is Mackenzie. I am 14 year old girl, whoever I have gender dysphoria. I have very strong opinion and proud of who I am despite my past. When I was 8 I was diagnosed with Autism, with that came a number of other diagnoses, including, depression, social and generalized anxiety, OCD, and more. Since I was such a young age these titles weighed my mental health down even more but instead of letting someone I trust know I kept it deep down. 5 or so months later my dad got a job offer in Qatar (a small country in the middle east) so we moved. I was starting out a new school with completely different beliefs from my own. When I started at the school I was still nervous but I made a close friend quickly who I am still friends with to this day. The next year my brother was starting school, however the current school I went to was too expensive for both of us to go, so we moved to a much cheaper school. This school was a public school meaning it was very Muslim based rather than western like my previous school. At this new school I was the only white kid, other than my brother who was 4 grades below me. I was bullied constantly for my different religious beliefs, opinion, mental health and even the color of my skin. I devolved my love for acting at the time and auditioned for the school performance. I got a lead role however a girl protested that she hadn't auditioned because she was away the day. The teachers asked her which role she wanted and she said she wanted the role I had received. So naturally, the teachers decided we would both audition for the role (me a second time) in front of the classes and then it would be decided. So we did. Afterwards the other kids where protesting for a vote, I believe to this day just to kick me out of the role. In the end the teachers decided and I kept the role. This made a lot of the kids mad that I had now won a privilege, now moving from verbal to physical abuse. This was a completely different culture so it was very difficult to get the kids to stay away and be punished for there actions. I still have a very nasty bump on my head which has been classified as a dead skin clump due to me being bashed on the back of my head multiple times on the back of my head. Many of the kids had older siblings that went to the school. (the school was from ages 4 to 18) that they would talk to often. I used to always walk home by myself as the younger kids went home earlier. My lived in the opposite direction as most of the other family at the school so I felt safe walking home. One day I was walking home I noticed a boy wearing the same school uniform as me but he was much older than me and didn't know him and kept on walking.  I still had about 15 minutes to go to get home so I just listened to music. 5 minutes later he ran up to me and grabbed me. He then pulled me aside and raped me. Mind you I was 8 and he seemed to be about 15 or 16. As he walked off he said to me ""That's of my brother"". That's when I remembered seeing him talking to one of the boys who bullied me. I went straight home and cried. I told my parents later that day but none of us could do anything. This is because in Qatar it is illegal to have sex before you are married, so I would been the one punished. Even with minor is was a minimum of 1 year in detention. It has been 6 years since then. I am now living back in my hometown. Proud of who I am and stand up for my self. I am a proud lesbian and have been in a healthy relationship. I am still quiet nervous to get touched in a sensual way and my girlfriend completely understands. A lot of people ask me why I don't just forget it and move on. I tell them I don't want to move on. I wear it proudly like badge. It is part of who I am. I am not ashamed or embarrassed instead I stand up for those who are in the same situation I am. I hope others who have managed to read the whole way through this I hope you help other like this and if you have been assaulted by anyone in your past, it is OK to be nervous, scared, angry or upset but please move on. Don't let it stop you from being who you are. Instead be proud of how it has shaped you and how you dealt with.",1588149828.0

These men would ask me to create a Kik or add them on it. Being the naive kid I was, I did. They would send me dick pics, videos, and would ask for some in return. To me, it felt like they loved me, like they gave me attention that I longed for because they would compliment me and tell me what they wanted to do to me. 

Even though it‚Äôs been two years, I regret sending them pictures. I regret it and I wish I knew better because you always hear about sexual assault stories and someone gets physically touched but because I wasn‚Äôt touched at all, I believe I wasn‚Äôt assaulted because I should have know better than to go on that website and talk to those men and fall into their trap. And I hated how they knew my age and I hated even being there...

I can‚Äôt say how I feel. I find disgust in anything sexual, but sometimes I act sexual in my room alone because I just need to and I hate it. I hate it so much and I wish it would go away and I constantly think about it and question if it really was assault

Only two people in my life know about it and they‚Äôre my two friends. I told one because I was having a breakdown over a comment a guy told me on tumblr and the other was when I was trying my costume on for drama and the cleavage was too low(not like I have any) and I almost cried over the amount of skin there was",1578315129.0

I met him when I was 11, I started experiencing gender dysphoria at its fullest at the time, so I was really anxious about my body, my face, everything about me, I started talking with my ex online because he seemed nice and he said he can ""rate"" my body, if I send him pics, I sent him pictures because I was a stupid child.  
When I met him in person everything seemed surreal, I don't think I even felt like it was happening to me, he gave me women's clothing, was pretty nice, but then he raped me and beat me, I don't even remember what I felt, but think thats for the better.  


He blackmailed me with my pictures and CP he took of me, I live in Russia, the fear of my parents knowing who I am felt horrible and he liked how I begged for him not to ruin my life even more. I started seeing him few times a month, and everything was like it was the first time we met, he'd be nice, then beat me and rape, sometimes he didn't even feel the need to be nice in the beginning.  


My life was pretty much in his hands, and he adored it, he fed my anorexia, telling me how cute I am because of my weight (I was 150cm in height and around 40kg in weight), pretty sure thats because it made me even more helpless.  


He did have other relationships, during the 4 years I have been with him he had 3 partners besides me.  
1. Nick- another kid, he got raped by his father continuously and my ex decided to make his life even worse, he killed himself.  
2. I don't remember his name, but he had a bf, I don't remember anything about him besides that he taught me how to work out to make my body look better.  
3. Alice- a pretty nice gal, she encouraged me to eat, get more sleep, it was pretty nice but she also did stuff to me, just touching mostly, so it wasn't that bad.  


My ex shaped my whole personality, I feel warm thinking about him, even when its the memories of him making fun of me, beating me, raping me. I want him to call me his little princess again, his anorexic, his pet and slave, and I hate myself for wanting that.  
The worst part are the tactile hallucinations, I feel him touching me from time to time, I can't function when I feel that.  
I just want back, I know I won't be happy, but I want to feel that warmth again, I know he doesn't need me anymore.",1572759682.0

I‚Äôve been in a relationship for 5 years and I still haven‚Äôt been able to talk about some of my past trauma. My partner is beyond amazing and more than I could ever ask for, but self doubt has led me to think that I can‚Äôt be open about certain occurrences I‚Äôve left out and have had trouble bringing up. I was molested by a neighbor as a child, a friends brother not long after, assaulted in high school before a class started when I was 14, raped two years later at a party at age 16. I‚Äôve never been fully honest about this to anyone. 

I know this is a pretty normal feeling, and it used to never bother me or be an issue. I just recently started trying to take a more sober turn in my life, while not completely (still smoke weed and microdose occasionally, working on cutting out alcohol), but I‚Äôve been trying to live a more healthy lifestyle. I‚Äôm 24, almost 25, and I haven‚Äôt lived without numbing myself or trauma by self-medicating since I was 14. I know I can be honest with him, he‚Äôs told me plenty of times and we‚Äôve always been pretty open, I‚Äôm just not sure the best way of opening up without immediately making the conversation weird. It has caused issues in our relationship, namely because my issues have caused me to act out on unhealthy urges that stem from my trauma.

My biggest concern, which I just started feeling within the last year, is my immense guilt and that I won‚Äôt be believed or it seems ‚Äúmade up‚Äù that someone could be assaulted multiple times. I know I believe other women/men/any other genders when I hear stories about multiple assaults/rapes over the course of years, but I still feel like my personal story won‚Äôt be believed. I‚Äôm so ungodly stubborn it‚Äôs already hard for me to admit that I was raped, and I still have trouble saying it, which leaves me in this predicament.

Not asking for much, maybe if anyone has had some similar problems within their relationships, or maybe just some suggestions on broaching the issues? I don‚Äôt want to keep this bottled up for much longer.",1580644466.0

(I don‚Äôt currently use language like sexual assault or violence to describe this and prefer that others don‚Äôt as well.) This happened like twelve years ago at this  point. We both eventually came out as trans (she‚Äôs a trans woman and I am trans masculine non-binary), so there are definitely some interesting gender dynamics at play (namely, when this happened, she was presenting as a cisgender man and I was presenting as a cisgender woman). This entire thing basically ruined my life when I was in high school.

We recently ended up in the same group chat together due having similar careers and mutual interests. It took us a few days to figure out who the other was, but we both figured it out on Wednesday. She privately messaged me sort of taking responsibility (but not really) and also offering space to hear my experience or whatever. She also said something along the lines that she‚Äôd be open to helping me heal or something.

I‚Äôve been thinking about this and the idea of restorative justice came to mind. But I have no idea what to expect from that kind of thing. Has anyone here ever done anything like that?",1579356670.0

Me and my gf met in high school and immediately became close friends and then a couple. I think she's the one for me. Things have been chaotic in our relationship mostly because of her insecurities, but never thought that it was this serious. Her parents are divorced and she lives with her mom and her stepfather which is a really cool guy and I admire him a lot. After 6 years of knowing each other, our families have a pretty good and solid relationship. Everything seemed cool. We were 16 at the time, young and in love. I need to mention out I'm bipolar so that adds to the chaos inside the relationship, but you know it's true love because we've helped each other even in our darkest times and never ever let the ship sink. Yes we had arguments, yes we had split up but we keep fighting against the world.

I've met her biological dad after two years of being a couple. He's fat, disgusting, misogynistic, but I tolerated him because I loved her. 

She would have signs of physical abuse Everytime she and her little sis went to his house so I tried to talk this with her but she said it wasn't that of a big deal. I didn't think anything more was involved

We broke up a year ago for like three months and I went on a full manic episode; being promiscuous, workaholic, alcoholic, almost unstoppable. Maybe it was a way to prevent being depressed, I don't really know why it happened. The thing is, she became really depressed and started binge drinking, drug abusing, being into anorexia, and went on dates with almost 40 different dudes (and some other Genders too). She got diagnosed with depression and anxiety and started taking pills.
She had a meltdown in which we started talking as friends and became intimate quickly after soon. We talked about what we did those days and she revealed while in a crisis that guys would always tried to abuse her, rape her or groped her and call her misogynistic stuff so she developed some hate towards men
We started hanging out and at times she got badly drunk and go to her place she would drop tiny hints that she was abused but wouldn't tell me directly. Next morning I would confront her trying to be the most empathic human being I could and ask her about what she told me while drunk but she would reply with ""forget it, I was drunk and talking nonsense""

I tried to stop her from drinking too much but found out it was her way to tell me things she couldn't. I helped her get out of drugs, get back to college and be sociable again, so I'm really proud of her.

Everytime she got drunk with me she would drop some hints. The hints were as they follow (every night was a different one):
1. ""I hate men. They always try to take advantage of me. Please just use me and leave me, I don't care, I don't want anyone else touching me if it ain't you.""
2. ""I have some memories that I have suppressed, but they keep coming back and I'm afraid that someone would hurt me again"" (She became real paranoid at this point of her life)
2. ""My father is a bastard! I hate him so much for making me miserable!""

(Things started to get creepy after this. To put you in context, we both like doing some Dom/sub, light bdsm, role-play and fun stuff while im bed and we have a safeword for when we want to stop)

3. ""I'm scared of my dad, I don't want my little sister to suffer what he did to me before"" (I got the chills)

4. (This is really creepy and I cried a lot, because I knew what I was thinking was real) ""I hate my dad so much. My mother was always working and he was a pathetic lazy good for nothing bastard. He was always punishing me for every single thing and hit me, kicked me, and humiliated me... (Pause, and she started crying) He had this weird look in his eyes, the same state all those guys who tried to touch me had. He didn't see me as her daughter but as a woman"" (She fell asleep in my arms).

After some weeks of crying and feeling terrible I decided I had to do something with it and started talking with her, I would her I supported her and will always do it, I would die for her and wouldn't let anyone hurt her. I told her what she told me, she seemed confused and told me it was drunk gibberish and that she had things mixed up. I didn't believe her but still cuddled with her and tried to be the cutest and nicest guy ever.

The sixth time she got drunk, we were having some rough sex play and I was Dom and sexually humiliating her (lightly, nothing we haven't done before and nothing she didn't like or enjoyed). She bursted in tears, screamed at me I'm a rapist, just like everyone else, just like her father when he made her do things she didn't want. She said she was so little, and accepted to do it because she didn't want him to do these things to her little sis. He would use physical abuse with fists, kicks, hair pulling, humiliation, broomsticks, stones, even hot glue pistols (she has scars) and cigarettes and I snapped. I hugged her and let her cry. I told her that she could have said the safeword but say that it's not my fault.

Next day I tried to talk this with her but she said that she just didn't want to talk about it (this happened yesterday) so I just hugged her, told her I'll be there for her whenever she needs me just as she has been there for me, that whatever she chooses I will support her and that when I have a little more income (maybe two months) I'll pay her some therapy.

I love her guys, and she is suffering and it breaks my heart Knowing these things. i'm confused, I feel some guilt for not recognizing the symptoms before and always getting mad because of her insecurities and all the problems this brings up on the table. She has been suicidal before. Her anxiety is getting worse and worse. She never told this to anyone, not even her mom, not even her therapists
What should I do? What would you do? I don't wanna lose her. I wanna help her and be the best guy she could ever imagine.

Please help me, please, don't do it for me, but you can help me help her get through this

We were together for almost five years and I ended it back in February. I (F 24) left my soulmate. And now we're so estranged. She's (Non-binary/AMAB 23) literally a new gender now. Of course I still love her and I'm so happy that she is living her best life. But I don't even know her anymore. It's like I'm literally talking to a different person. She is literally a completely new person. And it's not even just the gender transition. Her personality. I mean everything has changed. Even her sense of style, taste in music, friend group. When I say everything, I mean EVERYTHING.

We see each other on and off but whatever we had for those five years is gone now. It's just this awkwardness. I can't explain it. Like we just met and we don't really know how to act around each other. And this was my soulmate for 5 years! I used to know her inside and out and now I'm just so confused.

I feel lonely all the time and I reach out to her always thinking it will help. But I'll lay next to her and feel even lonelier. The sex is really weird and different and just disconnected.

Oh, I want to make it clear I did NOT leave her because of her transition. I supported that 100%. We had some other issues. She was slightly jealous and possessive but I also was starting to drift away and want to explore relationships with other people so the jealousy and fear she had obviously weren't out of the question. Things were getting toxic and I felt the need to ""be free"" from our relationship. I haven't felt free since. I've just felt sad and heartbroken and like there is something missing from my life and whatever is missing is something that she used to provide for me.

It is probably worth mentioning that since our breakup, we have both experienced rape (separately). I know you're thinking what are the odds, but we are both LGBT and sexual assault is too god damn common in our community, we were also both in vulnerable spots after this breakup. Part of me wonders if this broke us and now we can't be repaired. In the past, we would have at least had each other to lean on had this sort of thing happened. But we were both alone at the time. It just sucks. I literally can't stop crying right now.

Tl;dr I broke up with my ex back in February and I miss her like crazy. We've tried reconnecting but due to her gender transition, and just complete change in personality, I feel like I don't know her at all anymore and it makes me feel even lonelier. We both have been victims of sexual assault since our breakup and I believe it could have broken us in a way that we can't mend.",1576200740.0

Because I am so unsure I am going to be including a bunch of other info just in case it helps people to gleam something about whether I have just tricked myself into thinking it was or not.

&#x200B;

I was born with multiple conditions, autism, dyslexia, ADHD, and Kleinfelters (one of the symptoms of which is an extremely low libido).

I am also Bisexual and Trans Female.

Since I was very young I have had depression and anxiety due to bullying from a young age and dysphoria.

At some point when I was at the youngest 6 and at the oldest 8, I began what I now know in hindsight to be highly sexual behaviour such as roleplaying sex between my toys, between me and my toys, and (for want of a better word) masturbating.

When I was between 6 and 10 I remember something happening in a toilet at a church that felt sexual and wrong and I remember lying on the baby changing table but that's all I remember.

When I was between 8 and 10 my older sister (she was 4 1/2 years older then me and I am certain she was in secondary school at the time) went through a period of excessive violence towards me and around when she stopped we engaged in a sexual act which was effectively dry humping but I don't recall why we did but I think it was her idea.

After that, I began acting even more sexual and began to be fascinated but also disgusted by the subject of rape to the extent that I went out of my way to find stories and discussions about it.

For about 4 years in secondary school, I was regularly sexually assaulted by the boys in my class and one particular older girl (she was the worst).

After that nothing happened except my fascination/disgust with the subject of rape continued and I began to realise just how overtly-sexual I was as a kid.

I also experienced a number of deaths from close family members and friends including my older sister who not long before she died (from mysterious circumstances surround her medication and her husband) she admitted that her husband had raped and abused her and around the time she had been violent towards me and stuff she had recently been raped and sexually assaulted.

About a year ago now I and my best friend were hanging out and drinking. We had already been drinking quite a bit mixing Beers, Shots, Cider, and Mojitos. I was feeling particularly introspective and lonely at the time and when it was suggested that we stop I said we should keep drinking. I did, however, find that contrary to usual I was getting far drunker than usual (I'm tall, overweight, and an alcoholic so my ability to hold my booze was very strong especially compared to my best friend).

Whilst we were sat down alone at one point at their place I was feeling depressed about my Gender Identity and made a statement along the lines of ‚ÄúIf things had been different I would have been your girlfriend‚Äù.

Upon hearing this the person I was with suggested that I engage in a sexual act with them and I decided that yes I would because I was feeling off and wanting some validation and I felt like this would provide it. After some time off that I began to feel ill but not wanting to upset them and because I was still feeling like I needed to prove myself, rather than request to stop I asked if they wanted to stop to which they said no so I pushed through and continued. After a while, I requested more clearly that I wanted to stop and they again said no but once again I didn‚Äôt feel like I had a choice, so we continued. At a further point when I went to stop again he grabbed hold of me on my head forcefully so as to make me keep going, I pushed him off and stood up.

I was shaken but decided that I would continue because I thought I might as well try to make it work and suggested another slightly different but more invasive sexual act. I recognised that it wasn‚Äôt working too well so I left to collect some stuff to help. However after trying again it didn‚Äôt work so we tried a different position and around this time I became aware that I was not enjoying myself at all so I requested to stop but they said no and kept going, after a while I was feeling upset so I then pushed them off and sat down next to them saying I wanted to stop, at which point they roughly grabbed at my genitals, and  thigh and then began to molest my genitals even though I said no but I was too tired and feeling too queasy from the alcohol by now to push them off I was starting to feel rather distressed and in the end I didn‚Äôt even fight because I thought if I let them continue they would finish and we could stop, they then grabbed at my breast.

After an indeterminate amount of time, they stopped and I left the room though I can‚Äôt remember where or to do what. Upon my return, they were passed out and I redressed myself and them, then I went to sleep, in the morning they claimed to not remember anything about the encounter at all.

After that I felt off all day and the ‚ÄúR‚Äù word kept coming into my mind but I kept rejecting it because I had gone to get that stuff and I am fairly strong and could of pushed them off so obviously I must've wanted it on some level. However as the days went on I found myself having flashbacks and nightmares about the event and found that I could barely look at myself or interact with my body without a flashback and a feeling of revulsion and nausea.

The feeling I couldn‚Äôt escape was that feeling of violation like something had been done that should never be done and that‚Äôs why it hurt my heart and made me feel gross and broken.

&#x200B;

The three events I am questioning is the event in the church bathroom, the event with my sister, and this final event with my best friend.

&#x200B;

After detailing most of this my therapists only suggestion of her opinion was that my best friend might of put something in my drink.

&#x200B;

The most fucked up thing though is that I kind of want to put myself in a situation where I would be raped just so that I can feel valid for these emotions and feelings I am having which feels horribly offensive to me and if anything it would just add more confusion to my mind but I still feel that way (not that I would ever be that reckless).",1575108958.0
18,18,I need advice about reporting rape,19,bdjpox,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/bdjpox/i_need_advice_about_reporting_rape/,20,"Hi I'm new to Reddit and Id thought I'd ask for some advice. 

For some context at the time I was 12 years old and a fairly extroverted dude. I live in the UK. I was in my last year of primary school when this happened. 

I was friends with a classmate called Ryan Douglas, he was an okay person I had first met him 2 years ago when he moved into my kids club I used to be in, he just happened to be in the same street as him. He was the same age as me.

His personality was very sexual in nature especially in the last year of primary school he would  very hands on with boys making sexual remarks and groping me and other people in my friendship circle. He also claimed  a corner of the play group as his ""sex corner"" where said groping would usually occur.

I dont remember how he managed to coerce me into doing this but i remember him raping me in the toilets at school, this happened twice. Although at the time I didn't recognise it as anything bad, most likely due to me not ever being exposed to sex or taught about sexual assault/exploitation in school.  This happened near the beginning of year 6.

The incident that was known by others was one time when I was playing tag with some friends and I had tripped in the back corner of the play ground in a sexualish position, he took this opportunity to take advantage of me and I can remember all the strength being drained from my arms from shock and fear. Usually id be able to fight someone like him off but i couldn't now it was so frightening. Luckily my friend and witness shoved him off of me.

On the day this happened it was some day were we had to decorate eggs (I forgot what purpose this was for) and I was so emotionally shaken I kept lashing out at him crying and having outbursts afterwards. My teacher threw away my egg and thats when I told her. She told the head mistress at the time and my parents were contacted and the police were called although they only knew about that one situation and not the previous groping and rape. The police came over and nothing really came of it due to my mother ""not wanting me to get into the legal stuff"" or something which I hate her for saying that.

**Heres some bonus info:** 

* He got banned from our year 6 final week long trip because of the incident but the school refused to get rid of him even though I was screaming in the middle of class because he was right behind me in class and mocking me. I also though basketballs at him to get him away from me because I was terrified . The head mistress was acting like i was crazy for reacting like this.
* Another incident contributed to his banning, he humped girls on the school fences, im surprised he wasn't expelled from the school.
* Since the incident I have become a very reserved anxious, depressed, introverted and paranoid person. I had also developed (I have managed to stop about 3 years after) a lot of weird behaviours such as soiling myself for no reason and not caring about my well being, I was told this could be a symptom of PTSD but im not a professional so im not sure. He lives down my street and I keep seeing his and his appearances are becoming more frequent and im becoming increasingly scared to leave the house. He once was walking behind me and called my name but i pretended the music was to loud to here him and walked into the local gas station till he left.
* I was also informed by a friend that he was sexual with her in an Xbox live party chat. That friend recently texted him and I was fucking terrified and told her to stop but she did it anyway, I wish i could of told her but im to scared to tell her.
* He was caught with the upper half of a knife which me and my 2 friends witnessed him cutting himself with recently after the rape incident and i was able to locate and give to a teacher.

I moved a lot, I remember my life, I just don't remember which order it all takes place in. With few exceptions, it was mostly me, my mother and my older sibling. (I have other siblings, around 6 or 7,  but I don't live with them. also fun fact, they are all the opposite gender of me, you'd expect at least one to be the same gender). I was mainly beaten up, scared and alone by my elder sibling(who'll ill call rapist for simple terms ) who would manipulate. I would never tell on Rapist, due to a mix of fear, pity and because of rapists Previously mentions manipulations. but as to the molestation, It started when I was pretty young. I don't remember the age due to me not knowing which order my life took place in, but I know it was really young. Rapists would Force me To do things. If I failed to comply, then rapists would hit and abuse me. not going to go into Further detail, but it got worse and worse. lets fast forward to today.  lots of people know of the abuse I went through. unfortunately, I have a lot of people who don't believe I've been raped and some even mock me. there are some who have given their condolences. The biggest reason they believe I wasn't raped is that I'm a male, who was raped by a female. sadly, a lot of people don't believe males can be raped. if you noticed, I was ambiguous when mentioning my abuser. I did it because I wanted to know how many people assumed That I was female(just a small experiment, I believe the members are more open then the world, so I doubt the number will be high, please be honest if you thought I was female ). anyways, today, I noticed some things. I have no desire to have sexual intercourse. I was given an opportunity to have sexual intercourse with my girlfriend(we broke up) and then realized that I didn't wish to Have sexual intercourse. I didn't even enjoy when she sent me nudes. I'm not saying I have no sexual urges, I do. I look at porn and such. generally, I don't like sexual body parts(penis, vagina, and stuff). I'm not a psychotherapist so I can't say, but it could be because of my abuse. I also have trouble expressing emotion. I'm done writing this.

21,21,Sensitively Portraying Sexual Violence in Creative Project,3,ckm6mv,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/ckm6mv/sensitively_portraying_sexual_violence_in/,6,"Hi all, I am new to Reddit and have specifically made this account to do some research for my final year creative project.

My  animation project is about sexual violence and the PTSD that comes with  it. The aim of this project is to establish that sexual violence does  not discriminate against gender, ethnicity and sexuality. In my attempt  to create a piece of socio-politcal art, I would like to sensitively  portray people who have become victimized by sexual violence.

Within  my project I would like to use nude images of people who have been  sexually violated. The nudes would then be turned into a changing  collage of torsos, to show that rape does not discriminate. I do know  that I would need to write up a NDA (non-disclosure agreement) to  protect the people whose images I would use.

Now  for my question... Is this appropriate? I understand that one of the  last things someone would want to do after being sexually violated is to  send nudes to a total stranger. The intention of this part of the  project is to give people authority of their bodies again, much like the  work of Jenny Saville.

Any  thoughts on this would be appreciated as the last thing I would like to  to is misrepresent or create something that could be misunderstood.",1564681357.0
22,22,The first of three rape encounters I experienced in my life and a great regret.,5,d0j5lc,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/d0j5lc/the_first_of_three_rape_encounters_i_experienced/,1,"My second biggest regret is when I was 10 I failed to protect a friend from being raped.  This happened on the New Orleans Naval Base in the residential area.

She was 14. It was a group of 6 boys who were all much bigger than me, all around 14. My brothers were at her place playing.  My bothers were 9, 7, 6.

I had been having gender issues for awhile now.  I suspected she knew.  As I a male like my brothers was the only one not curious about female anatomy or trying to see parts of her.  She played my brothers off as little boys being little boys.  Especially since we didn't have a sister. I suspected she knew something was different about me as we would have more emotional conversations but she never outright asked anything and I didn't understand myself.

I had been home playing Nintendo.  Mom ordered me to go get my brothers and bring them home for lunch.  I went over and we talked a bit while they all started picking up to leave.  Then a guy came over who said he was her boyfriend.  I knew of him in the neighborhood and hated him cause he was a bully.  

Me and him had fought a couple times.  I lost each time simply cause he was much bigger and stronger, but he walked away hurt every time.  I was a military brat that moved a lot so I had a lot of fight experience from bullies going back to second grade. So now he only bullied me when he had his friends.  Which wasn't easy as I only left my Nintendo to hang out with my friends.

When he showed up I noticed my friend get fidgety.  We both stopped talking.  I was upset he was there also.  She took him in her home and had him sit down then went back to cleaning up the toys with my brothers.  I was on sever guard and ready for a fight.

Not long after more of his buddies showed.  Two more came over and just walked into the house to chat with their ringleader.  I moved over near the wiffle ball bat and just stood glaring at them.  They looked and smirked at me.  I told my brothers to hurry up mom was waiting.  The last three of his group trickled in.  I put my hand on the bat and told my brothers again to hurry up.

My friend was keeping the peace for now.  I walked over and asked if she was ok.  She said she was fine.  The toys were nearly picked up and she saw the tension and bat in my hand.  She took the bat and put it away.  Then asked my brothers to finish up and took her boy friend upstairs to her room. The others guys followed them up the stairs.

My brothers finished cleaning up and I took them outside to leave.  But I felt things were bad.  I told my brothers to stay put and went back inside and up the stairs.  There I saw two boys outside of her bedroom and the door open.  I took a deep breath and stormed forward.  When one tried to stop me I side stepped and shoved him over into his friend.  Then walked right into the room.  I saw two boys holding her down while those two and her boyfriend took her clothes off. They turned to me furious.  I demanded to know what was going on.  

Physical sex was still very much an alien concept for me.  So I truly didn't understand what was going on.  Only they seemed to be hurting her. 

 Two boys holding down my friend and another standing to the side and the two behind me came walking to me.  My friend called out and they paused and stood up.  She told me nothing was happening and I should go home right away.  I could see she was scared.  I got into a fight stance.  I knew this was bad. And I was really scared.  Any one them could physically over power me.  My skills were better but not by a lot.  

I suggested she come home with me.  My mom was cooking a good meal.  The boys started moving at me again and her boyfriend forced her to sit back on the bed.  They all five came at me.  I  got into a fight stance and prepared.  Then the two behind me grabbed me both arms.  I was surrounded after all.  Then all five grabbed me.  I weighted 65 pounds.  Barely anything.  They dragged me out of the room.  Where they then picked me up off the ground.  They tossed me down the stairs case.  I hit the floor and they laughed from above.  

My brothers had come back inside and ran to my side asking what was going on.  They were getting scared.  I stood up and started climbing back up the stairs when my brothers called out.  Even they knew this was bad.  The boys at the top said I should take my brothers home before they get hurt too. I froze.  I looked down at my brothers and back at the boys.  I was torn between protecting my brothers and my friend.
I was smaller and younger than them but I was full of rage from my gender issues.  I knew if I released it all I could eventually take them cause once I let go it didn't matter how many times I was knocked down I would always get back up.  But I knew I also wouldn't be able to keep my brothers out of it.  They didn't have my experience or rage.  I had put down the bullies at the schools who messed with them and kept me as their target.  My choice was the allow my brothers to get dragged in to save my friend or squash the rage and take them home abandoning my friend.

I was truly terrified by both prospects.
In the end I chose family.  I glared at the boys with absolute hate.  I was going to make them suffer.  I then descended the staircase.  I herded my brothers out of the house and took them home.  My mom never listened to me so I told her nothing.  I went to my room and played on my Nintendo and didn't eat that night.

I stayed shut until the next day when she game over to visit me.  She came and sat beside me and told me what happened.  At the time I didn't know what the word rape meant.  All I knew is they hurt my friend.  We talked and we both cried.  A couple weeks later she was sent away.  I never got a chance to see her again or say goodbye.  I found out later her father had sent her away to protect her.  He tried to do something about the rape.  But the boys father's were powerful people on the base so it was covered up.  I had tried hunting down the boys to make them pay for hurting my friend but they were all on permanent grounding and never left their homes.  The boys families were all relocated within a month after the incident away from the base.

I regret not protecting my friend.  That my inaction lead her being hurt.  That action left a deep wound that hurts to this day and has let me to never abandon a friend again.",1567817038.0
23,23,My (AMAB) rapist transitioned to female and I'm conflicted,0,bo6n0g,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/bo6n0g/my_amab_rapist_transitioned_to_female_and_im/,6,"So anyway, long story short. I lost my virginity at 15. I was raped. It was in a very unspectacular fashion, so in general, people are pretty dismissive of it. Because of that, it took me a long time to really acknowledge what happened as rape, despite the undeniable ways it impacted me for a long time. This person was widely regarded as a complete asshole at the time. I haven't seen them since high school, before they came out. The popular opinion on them has changed to be more favorable since they began their transition, and I'm not sure if it's because of that or if they've really drastically changed as a person (I've heard that they are less of a shit human being now, but having not interacted with them in years, I have no idea if this is true or not).

Anyway. I am a very serious feminist (intersectional, ofc) which is really what led me to finally be honest with myself about what happened. I'm very politically radical. I am generally open-minded and tolerant. I am also bisexual, so familiar with LGBTQ issues. I guess I am technically cis, however, I admit that I don't really ""get"" gender as a concept (despite my attempts to). I don't feel that my lack of understanding is an excuse or barrier to being supportive of this particular community, so I do my best to be a respectful advocate and I have even dated several NB folks (nobody who is actually trans, though as far as I know).

I guess I'm having a really hard time reconciling pieces of my identity in light of the fact that my rapist is MtF. Like, it makes me pretty angry that someone who cared so little about me as a person now gets to identify as a woman, like they somehow have something, anything in common with me. I guess what bothers me most is they get this unquestionable pass to shed this identity as a rapist, because that wasn't really the ""real"" them. That's a dead person, a dead identity. So it feels like they don't have to be accountable anymore, it's an out. I also don't feel like I can talk about my rape (particularly with people who also know my rapist) because it's acknowledging this ""past self"" which makes me come off as some sort of bigot. And I feel really ashamed of myself and guilty for having these feelings, anyway, like it makes me feel hypocritical and transphobic even though I have nothing against trans folks in general. And then that just makes me feel even worse about the rape and the initial emotional conflict, because I just have to pretend it didn't happen or else I'm the asshole. It just feels really unfair, and I have no idea how I'm supposed to come to terms with these feelings because it's apparently such an uncommon scenario. I cannot find any similar accounts so I can't even reassure myself that it's reasonable and rational to feel this way, or alternatively convince myself why it's not. I feel like there's no one it's okay to talk to about it, and definitely not anyone who can empathize.",1557798170.0

I'm just saying, go ahead and bury it. But I'm guessing, not sure, has to be much harder for a man to perform physically under some situations. Not pretending to enjoy it, actually perform. They have to lie to themselves and cry inside. And be physically able to ""do the deed"" and pretend. I could go into the gender differences, but I'm gonna say, it has to be much more difficult for a guy to convince a part of his body under the threat of repeat violence... to be aroused.
 
It's a real thing, and it's totally screwed up because of the mental part. Men can't just, well, you get the clue. 
 
A guy has to pretend he likes the situation in order to perform vs. be hurt. He's up, maybe he didn't ""finish"", but he was erect so he enjoyed it. Weird, isn't it? I could call it out, but I won't.
 
That leads to all sorts of mind issues. I'm not looking for an argument or anything. Ain't gonna go there.

Okay. Something you need to know before this is that I have depression, schizophrenia, gender dysphoria, and bipolar disorder. 

I had just got into the car after I went to a therapy session and he told me I looked sexy when he started driving. I was sobbing and having severe hallucinations, so I told him not now. He said I was a fucking bitch and not to have that tone with him, so I didn't say anything. When we got home he beat me and afterwards I made him dinner and went to bed and he got on top of me and tried to strip me. I pushed him off and he started cussing me out and trying to convince me I was in the wrong and he deserved my body. I told him I just wasn't doing it tonight and he held me down and.... 
I can't leave him because I feel in debt to him. I feel like I shouldn't leave him because he will just do this to other innocent people. I don't want anyone else to get hurt. I just want everyone to be okay.

This isn't a throwaway account. He sees everything I do on my emails, so I can't make a new reddit account.

I'm scared.

Edit; thank you for all of your help, but he's done this to every single girl/boy he dates. He torments them and forces them to mold into what he wants and manipulates them. I need to save someone, even if they don't know I'm doing it. I don't have enough money to leave him anyway, since he took me in when I got kicked out. He says I shouldn't have a job because I'm supposed to be, quote unquote, ""You're a housewife. You were born a girl and you are a girl. Get your head out of your ass and stop with this illness bullshit"". I'm going to try and get money myself-- please don't try to give me some in the comments-- so I can get into a college away from him.

I feel like I just paid to be forced to relive it all.,4,bnz5xw,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/bnz5xw/feeling_triggered_by_a_movie_i_feel_like_i_just/,1,"I‚Äôm real upset tonight. My mother sexually abused me so Mother‚Äôs Day comes with very mixed feelings. I still miss her even though she abused me. And I‚Äôm married with a son ‚Äî I can‚Äôt let my trauma interfere with my wife having a good Mother‚Äôs Day. But it‚Äôs still already a triggering day because the word ‚ÄúMother‚Äù is constantly in my face everywhere. But I managed to have a good day with my Wife and Son. 

Today part of our outing involved shopping and I bought a new movie. I take movies seriously. My degree is in film. I‚Äôm not exactly a ‚Äúfilm snob‚Äù I just take my entertainment seriously.  I picked out a movie I knew next to nothing about but it‚Äôs billed as an experiment in real time and meant to appear as a single unbroken shot just like Alfred Hitchcock‚Äôs ‚ÄúRope.‚Äù  It is also billed as being based on a true story. It‚Äôs a horror film and I‚Äôve been on a huge horror kick lately. It felt exactly like what I wanted/needed to end my day with a distraction. 

So, I sat transfixed on this for approximately 80 minutes. Then the huge plot twist cones out of nowhere. The main character is a victim of childhood sexual abuse, including that abuse being photographed. She finds a locked box containing all the Polaroids. Everything in the movie happened because she is experiencing flashbacks of her abuse. The whole point of her fear is her abuse. My own story of being abused was being exploited for child porn. I quite literally feel like I just watched a mirror of my own abuse, just genders reversed.  This movie claimed to be based on a true story. It sure feels like parts of it were based on mine. 

I don‚Äôt recall ever feeling this upset after a movie. As I look at the clock I realize that after the movie ended I stared at a blank screen for at least an hour before coming here tonight. I don‚Äôt normally rely on trigger warnings for films. But this time I wish I had some clue.  It would have ruined the ending to know in advance. But in this case I think I would prefer just not have seen it. I don‚Äôt like having endings ruined, but I wish I could have known to not see this one.

It started when I was 11. Me being a younger boy I hung out with every other guy in the neighborhood, even though they were older than me. The bastard, whom I‚Äôll call G from now on, and I were basically brothers. We played together everyday till it started, he was there from my birth till that point. Just side by side.

It started with him showing me porn, it made me feel icky. Like I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be seeing people like that, especially since it was violent shit. I‚Äôm talking hardcore stuff. I‚Äôm talking BestGore level. Stuff I‚Äôll never get out of my head. Stuff that really haunts me. That was my first introduction into anything sexual, he convinced me it was normal. I hate him for it. 

We were in the woods a lot during this time. I look back now, and it was clear no one could‚Äôve heard me if I had called for help when he had started touching me. I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt scream or anything. That‚Äôs what a real man would do, right?

It went sour quickly, I see now that my friend ‚Äúdied‚Äù the second he started doing those things to me. He‚Äôd strip off his shirt, give me five seconds to hide in the woods, then find me and do the thing these bastards do. (Forgive me for my language, I am just so mad).

This all stopped when I was 13, he outed me (I‚Äôm queer, sure go ahead and make fun of me all you want but I‚Äôm my sexuality is not caused by G. I discovered my gender and sexuality long before him) to my family through his texts. 

That‚Äôs when the ptsd started. The maladaptive daydreaming as well. Along with the rapid growth of my other mental illnesses. I‚Äôm lucky to have supportive parents and a good therapist, but still. I never got my Justice, it makes me so mad. 

It got worse when I entered Highschool. I still lived next to him and then I saw him every day. Everyday I relived the shit that had happened to me when I saw G‚Äôs stupid face. It got too much after awhile. I started to legitimately shut down. My boyfriend at the time (ex now sadly) noticed it and held me, he let me cry for a real long time. The school did nothing for me, they didn‚Äôt even move him away from me.

We‚Äôve moved now, I‚Äôm in a new school. I‚Äôm 15 years old now, an age G swore I‚Äôd never reach. It feels...indescribable. I want to share this all, I don‚Äôt know why.

For obvious reasons, a throwaway. I live in a small place, so it‚Äôs not like I got anyone to talk about this where I live. 

It came as a surprise but not too much- we worked closely together before on projects. I was our student director of our music program, and one of the more well-versed students. It wasn‚Äôt out of the ordinary for her to drive me home or us to meet up and grab coffee and discuss music and shoot the shit. The conversations started to steer towards relationships, but it seemed innocent. She was the first adult I ever came out to. 

One night during my junior year, I was at my high school for a stayover band camp. On a whim, we hooked up after everyone else fell asleep. I still remember her pulling me by my hand towards her office and locking the door. 

The next two years were a rollercoaster. For the first eight months, she seemed like everything sixteen-year-old me wanted. She was funny, good at sex, financially stable, and our chemistry was insane. I fell in love, quickly, and so did she. We discussed running away together after I graduated. Everything seemed alright. I am still screaming at myself for thinking this would all be okay. 

After this, things started to go downhill very fast. She became much more controlling- demanding to know where I was at all times, and accusing me of lying on several fronts (when I was exactly where I said I was). Everything I said was ‚Äúimmature‚Äù and ‚Äúnaive‚Äù and even when I knew what I was talking about, I didn‚Äôt. It started to get dark. We had our ups and downs, but the ups were more up and the downs were more down. I found myself crying most nights after we hung up and wondering what I said wrong to warrant yelling at me. We broke up once, because I accepted a ride home (I didn‚Äôt drive and the bus system where I lived sucks) from someone she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt approve of.‚Äù She ghosted me, then decided a few months later she wanted to be with me again. I didn‚Äôt say no. I was ill. Additionally, during these few months, someone found out about our relationship blackmailed me for about $500- but that‚Äôs beside the point. 

In addition to that, she *hated* the word no. Every fight ended in ‚Äúcome on, let me fuck you, you‚Äôll feel better.‚Äù She handled me with rough and unrelenting hands. She pushed my head down, she fucked me even when I was crying and staring blankly at the ceiling. She told me over and over and over ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt really love me if you don‚Äôt fuck me.‚Äù She choked me until I had bruises around my neck, slapped me until my cheeks were red, deliberately went against things I said no to. It was sheer, horrific hell. 

We officially broke up in November of last year. I found out she had been cheating on me for essentially the entirety of our relationship with multiple people. When I moved to NY for school, we dwindled up and died. She continues to attempt to contact me to this day. New numbers, new accounts. She also just got married to one of the women who she was cheating on me with....but hey. Auxiliary points.

Everyone I‚Äôve opened up to about this (read: all four of them) has responded with things like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a fantasy for some people, you should be stoked!‚Äù or try to tell me that I knew what I was doing and shouldn‚Äôt have expected it to turn out good. I just don‚Äôt talk about it anymore. One of the most supportive people with my healing process has been my current gf (shoutout to you Manu, you‚Äôre the best!)

I just want some advice on how to start healing. I feel like this is my fault but I also feel like it isn‚Äôt. Anyone with similar experiences wanna share?

I am a male to female transgender person and in order to tell my story to a perhaps wider portion to explain how I know I am.

Third of all this story inculudes graphic detail and an unfiltered version, if you are bothered by rape, abuse, or violence dont read, and i mean it.

When i am more perciveved as a female, just in normal life, and trust me i dont do much and im post everything. I am blessed by my looks. You wouldnt honestly know by looking at me until I spoke. Minus the tits.

Anyway, in the beginning of the relationship i presented as he, my life was such a hell it sucked even breathing. I had been through an abusive relationship before this one from a family who was abusive and i thought i could save them. Bro... that shit was intense too.

We met in a local shop i worked at. My friends were kinda there it was the end of the day, i had just broken up with another one i wanted to save but didnt have the will to do it anymore. So they were in there cheering me up.

Xie or... however you spell it. Look im from the south and this is how i write. I honestly dont understand the gender they tried to explain it just didnt say and they made up their own. For easier to understand they will be known as they now. As to hopefully not offend anyone.

They walked into the store with a friend. They asked me out and i was thinking not sure... and all of em just said say yes. So... i did.

It was fine at first until they stoped taking their medications... then everything went to hell. I never was on medication for anything before a few months ago before this. 

Boy we went for a ride. I mean they completely took me in for a fool, that i am because im diagnosed with bi-polar myself. I went on a few drug benders with them that was pretty stupid in the long run.

The first time i got hurt, it was christmas and we were fucked up on alchol, im usually a pretty huggy person when i get drunk. Its never sexual because honestly, i couldnt care less for it, but it also got really freaky fast...

I even expressed my discomfort with it, as a male known only, trump supportin ass, internet goblin i was. Also entirely depressed, until the night they forced me into anal, but at the same time was the worst, but the way they made me feel after words because the thing about rapists you know is rape is how you feel afterwords unless you are emotionally manipulated afterwords.

I had been exploring my gender... outside of the bedroom, because i couldnt keep it up otherwise tbh. They had told me they feed off sex for energy, um... i know its hard to believe when you also havent been manipulated for months. Also used the times i was manipulated by a mini cult when i was younger.

As in by another abuser, who was around my age. They were very similar to him, i think thats probably what got me so hooked so quickly.

Things turned physical  before that event too. I was choked, hit and bitten before all of that too. I took all of that too and im not sure why..

One time they had me in a chokehold but im pretty chill tbh, i kissed them on the cheek to get them to release me, because im also nonconfortationable at least at the time.

Then i got kicked from the apartment for attempting to kill myself after they broke up with me after all that.

This really bothers me and that is honestly only the first time i was with them. I wasnt that bothered at the time because im pretty forgetable of past mistakes, and im also pretty gullable after a few hours of my heroic nature. Not for them, but for someone else... they were just there.

32,32,Taking off condoms midway,4,aa91s8,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/aa91s8/taking_off_condoms_midway/,2,"It happened about over a year ago with someone who I mostly hooked up with consistently for at least 6 months. Let's call him Chris. Anyway, the sexual relationship with him wasn't the most healthy, since I did not have birth control at the time and was taking Plan B almost every two weeks...sometimes within just 2-3 days. I was in a bad place in my life and thought taking Plan B wasn't a big deal. Eventually, I was able to get out of this once my long distance boyfriend moved in and was able to slowly pull out the ""we were never serious card and this had an expiration date"" card. Ever since, I have not had sex with Chris, but I always wondered about one particular representative sexual encounter was actually rape. I would love feedback on this, since I often feel that I am overreacting or I am like those women who get accused of sleeping with someone and accuse them of rape due to ""regret"". I want to stop feeling crazy....

Sex would typically start out with a condom. Every single time I would think to myself that, this time, he will have the condom on throughout. I always had some pressure from him about going raw, he would always say that he would pull out. He never did every time and we would rush to get Plan B that day. I was in a bad spot mentally and always had hope. I enjoyed to be wanted as well, so I always wanted to please. When he asked me about what I thought about rape role play, I expressed that I am not into it, but, my aim to please failed to raise any red flag about Chris. He would also blame me for not being the person to make him snap out of it when he decided to go raw. This habit had led to an unwanted pregnancy with Chris, which resulted in an abortion where he paid half but also accused me of lying and not having acted fast enough. He also did not support me with his presence throughout the whole abortion process. I had no friends in this small college town. I essentially went through the whole process alone. 

There was one representative day which I tend to think about frequently. It has changed my sexuality as it was the last time I had sex with anyone. One day, me, Chris, and my boyfriend decided to meet up a month after my boyfriend moved in. I had thought that maybe it would be good for Chris to see the reality of the situation. I thought that maybe we can move onto a new chapter of having him be my friend. We had not had sex for a while before my boyfriend moved in as well. I felt hopeful that he maybe found someone else to have sex with. 

We had drinks, quite a lot of them, that day. We all took a taxi back to my apartment at 2am after a long night. We let Chris use our couch to crash. My boyfriend and I went to the bedroom to sleep. However, when my boyfriend went into the bedroom first, Chris made sexual comments to me and tried to grab onto me when my boyfriend was not looking. I felt bad somehow. It was like rejecting a puppy desperately wanting a pet. When I entered the bedroom and left Chris on the couch, I, like the sad, drunk, mentally deranged puppy that I use to be, said to my boyfriend, ""I feel bad for Chris because of this new dynamic"". Meaning, I was feeling bad that the thing I had with Chris was finished while I was drunk. I knew very well that my sober self wanted this to be over. I was scared of sex and I still am, but I was addicted to fulfill whatever sexual need Chris wanted me to fulfill. My boyfriend thought that maybe spending the night with Chris would be something that I wanted. I don't blame him. I said all the things I said to make him believe that I wanted that. We were both drunk still too. He strategically removed himself from the bedroom by going to the restroom and allowed for Chris to come into the bedroom when Chris saw the opportunity. My boyfriend ended up passing out in the living room. I use to blame him for this situation and I had later voiced my regret about that night. I don't blame him now. He thought he did something that would make me happy. 

Chris came into the room and shut the door. I tried to let him know that I didn't want to do it. He blocked the door and said he knows that I wanted him. He began to touch my crotch and I pushed back a bit but not hard enough. My mind knew that I wanted to do it with him again, but this time I was firm in telling him that I need him to not take off his condom like always. I told him that I was over being came into and reminded him about how recent the abortion was (just 2 months ago). I reminded him that this was the last time. Frustrated and conflicted, I gave in. He put the condom on. As always, I had hope. However, I noticed that he was reaching to take it off. I quickly grab his hand and told him to keep it on. I never did that. He kept it on the first time. He reached again. I restrained him again but it was tough. He took it off and then I reached for another unopened condom to put it on. He puts it on. I remember feeling temporarily relieved that he knows I'm serious until he was inside me again trying to take it off again. We did this for 4 more times. I gave up after the 6th attempt to get him to keep it on. It was a long time being on my back and having him on top of me while also trying to drunkenly fight for him to keep the condom on. He went raw and said to me that he thought it was funny that I thought I could ever be fucked with a condom ever. I had a hint that he had feelings for me when he was still going at it and asked me to continuously say ""I love you"" and ""I am your wife"" over and over again. I did it because I felt a lot of pressure. I didn't cry...I didn't restrain after I gave up...but I was disturbed by my mental state to have been able to go far as saying the things he wanted me to say. Once he was done, he wanted to cuddle. I was done and asked him to get out and sleep on the couch. I wanted to bring in my boyfriend back into the room. Still no sobbing...but I felt guilty, ashamed to have said all those things to him. I feel like a scumbag girlfriend to this day about it. 

I don't cry about the event, but I cry about what it had done with my sexuality. For a long time, I had felt the need to go back to Chris. With trouble, I had resisted all sexual advances he's tried to pull on me which would include exploiting my emotions to ""help him"" with work but really luring me into a gender neutral bathroom, groping me when my boyfriend isn't looking, and engaging in sexually explicit texts. Since that night, I managed to dodge and reject any sexual advances before I became pressured to have sex. Very recently, when I realized that it was destroying my sex life and intimacy with my current boyfriend, I started to snap out of it. I always felt guilty, but the feeling of knowing how it was affecting my boyfriend, I knew I was self sabotaging something I wanted to keep. Chris is not what I wanted. I started to align my actions against that intention. I have stopped hanging out with Chris. I actively avoid areas where I am likely to see Chris. I very seldom talk to Chris via text or social media. However, I still have my occasional run ins with him where I try to be friendly and platonic towards him. 

That night was the last time I have had sex in the typical sense. My boyfriend doesn't mind as he is not into it, but I feel like I have completely erased the option for the both of us anyway. I have a hard time with self pleasure as well and things that use to arouse me do not anymore as a result of that night. My sexuality has always been a part of my identity. Although I project my sexual life to deviate from the typical penetration sex due to boyfriend's preferences, seeing myself as a sexual being has been hard for a variety of reason that are connected to that night with Chris as well as unhealthy sexual habits I use to have which I feel guitly about. Not knowing if it should be considered rape or not as also made me feel guilty about my sexuality as well. 

I would love any feedback on this situation. It eats me up inside when I try to be intimate with my boyfriend at times or when I try to feel like a sane person in general. 

TL;DR : I am not sure whether a person I use to have sex with raped me. He took off condoms and put on condoms 6 times while I tried to restrain him. I gave up and did whatever he wanted me to do or say. My sexual life has been on a standstill because of it since I have not had sex and orgasm is hard to reach when I feel guilty all the time. It had also affected my relationship with current boyfriend. I would like feedback, because I feel crazy.

33,33,"Is this considered ""rape"" or something else or is it just in my head?",6,8his0y,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/8his0y/is_this_considered_rape_or_something_else_or_is/,15,"I'm sorry this is going to be long, but I really need to get it off my chest somehow.

I've been going out of control and acting completely out of character since the relationship with my toxic ex has ended. I'm a woman, and was dating another woman, who turned out to be very toxic and definitely emotionally and mentally abusive (very covert, and playing herself as a victim of her past/moods).

I was a virgin. She was my first sexual partner, and I was 24 when we first had sex. I've had a pretty abusive past emotionally, mentally, and physically growing up in my parents' house, hence very low self-esteem, undiagnosed (at the time) depression/anxiety/ptsd, and very fearful of sex and intimacy in general (my dad was creepy growing up, and I grew up fearing that he was sexually attracted to me and could do bad things to me...). I didn't go on my first date and have my first kiss until I was 23, and was convinced to be so horrendous physically that I didn't deserve love. 

I might have mood issues (?), because when I met her, I was in a very ""high"" phase, which made me more likely to act out, drink, dabble in drugs (just weed, but I was a very straight-edge person, while she was addicted to it and would offer it to me every time she wanted to have sex I now realize), go out, and have sex with her. At first, it was just oral sex, and I made it clear I didn't want to be penetrated. The first time we had oral sex, I didn't feel like a person just like a toy, she was just focused on my genitals, and the only thing I liked from our sexual relationship was the fact that I felt desired. That first time, I was almost a bit frightened, because she had just smoked and her eyes were dark and bloodied, she seemed different and a bit scary. I convinced myself it was good and tried to enjoy it (I've never orgasmed with her), especially because she was experienced and I learnt later that she had 100+ sex partners indiscriminate of gender (trying not to be judgmental here but this is the kind of info you wish to know before getting involved with someone and shouldn't be withheld. I got tested, everything came back negative thank God...).

After about 4 months, the relationship wasn't going well, she kept on going hot and cold and not communicating properly. It turns out her ex was still in the picture. She cheated on me with her. (I have reasons to think she was never faithful, and could have been sleeping with other people including men) I was devastated, especially since I learnt about it on my birthday by looking through her phone. We didn't talk for a whole month, and then for some reason, I just felt the need to have her back. I convinced myself I was to blame for the cheating, I wasn't a good girlfriend, I was selfish, I wasn't good enough in bed, I had been a narcissist (my fear since my parents are like that). I'm the one who went back to her, even though she didn't treat me well. She would even spit on me during sex, and made me feel used even though I'd convince myself otherwise. I was so ashamed and I couldn't find a voice to raise my concerns, I kept quiet and dissociated the memories away (something I now realize I was conditioned to do from my upbringing).

I went back to her, and it lasted about a month. I was so happy to be back with her, she might actually have loved me, I really wanted to believe it. But during that time period, the trust was broken and I needed to know for sure if it was just a game. I came across texts to her friend she had sent around the time we were breaking up in which she was saying the only thing she liked about me was the fact I was a virgin. That I was such a virgin... Using sentences like: ""That chick was from France"", bla bla bla, sending a picture of me to show off the fact that I was pretty. I read in her diary that she blew up her chances to be with that ex to ""claim a virgin, how fucked up is that?"".

I felt so ashamed, and I actually made excuses and explained it with the fact that she might have been angry or sad about the break-up (Idk what I was thinking... she probably didn't care at all). Even though I had read all that, I kept it to myself, and acted as if everything was fine.

During that last month, she would more blatantly make me feel like she thought of me as her property: she woke me up several nights just to have sex. I didn't say anything, but I definitely didn't like it. She would just wake me up in the middle of the night, and do whatever she needed to do. It happened at least twice. 

The one time that I'm confused about is that time we spent the weekend at her parents' house out of state. I made the mistake of saying that my mom would probably still consider me a virgin since I'd never been penetrated. I saw her face turn very serious, almost gloomy. That night, we were just relaxing on the porch, we ended up smoking some pot, she was wearing a strap-on. After a while, she was on top of me, and started teasing me with it. At one point, I knew she was in me, I asked her and she played dumb and surprised being like ""Oh, really?"", and then we had penetrative sex. I'm really conflicted because I didn't stop it, and I actually enjoyed it, but the next day, I felt like she tricked me into it and that my judgment was clouded by the weed I'd smoked. I didn't feel good about it.

It's been months since I've last seen or talked to her. The whole relationship hurt deeply. I've done a few regrettable things in desperation, especially after she decided to dump me after a month because I wasn't comfortable that she was still in contact with exes... I tried to convince myself that I didn't care about my virginity anyways, and that sex wasn't that serious overall. I've had one-night stands with complete strangers since then to make it more convincing, as if multiplying sexual partners would make sex with her also meaningless. I have been going out to bars, making out with strangers, rapidly cycling through mini dating-relationships. I've been very depressed, and can't make sense of why I feel so ashamed. I think I was in love with that person, that's the reason I stayed that long, but Idk if I'm changing the narrative into ""rape"", just because it turns out they probably didn't love me ever and were just playing me.

34,34,"My Husband [29 M] of 1.5 years forced me [23 N/A] to have sex, don't know how to stop blaming myself?",3,7yskyz,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/7yskyz/my_husband_29_m_of_15_years_forced_me_23_na_to/,12,"I've been lurking on Reddit in general for a while, made a throwaway to post this. I don't really have a gender, hence the N/A in the title.

Basically, a couple months after we got married, I asked him if he wanted to have sex. He said no he was too full and I said okay thats fine, went back to my phone. He then changed his mind a few minutes later and said actually let's do it, come on. I'm asexual so I didn't and don't have any urges for sex 98% of the time, it was just an offering because we hadn't had sex in a while.

I said no and he pressed me a couple times and I was afraid of upsetting him and gave up. It was terrible, I didn't move and I cried afterwards. He asked me what was wrong and I told him I didn't actually want to have sex. He obviously got very upset and asked me why I let him and I told him I was anxious about actually refusing. All this happened over a year ago.

Since then, we've talked a lot. He was angry at me for a short while immediately after without me knowing and then realized it was victim blaming. He is extremely remorseful and would take it back if he could. We were in a DD/Lo (daddy dom/little one) type of relationship before this happened so he explained that he thought at the time I was just being bratty/playful.

I've told 2 people. one didn't say anything. The other said that I ""have communication issues"". Obviously not very conducive to making me feel better. 

I can't tell anyone else IRL, we share friend groups. I don't want to jeopardize his or my relationships with people. I feel like if they knew, they would hate him for what he did and also me for not leaving him.

Also, the entire time since, we've had sex a handful of times and I cried every single time except the very last time. I don't want to leave him; I'm very dependent on him, he helped save me from a slow painful death at my abusive mom's house. And besides this really shitty thing, we are great. We have fights but work them out. We encourage each other to be better versions of ourselves.

So I guess I'm asking for advice on how to work through this for myself. I want to feel like I can move past this and stop feeling that I didn't really get raped because I'm still with him. I want to trust my best friend again.

36,36,I was raped by women,1,89xmh8,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/89xmh8/i_was_raped_by_women/,9,"I know people like to believe that men rape and that when and if a woman does rape or even molest that its not the same. That is true its not the same its actually worse. Its like when you see a ghost, because its not something everyone can say theyve experienced or even believe in so its basically more abstract than true. Even some of the stories ive heard from so called victims sound fabricated. Like reverse of what happens when guys rape someone, physical and dominating. I can tell you because it bothers me and affected me far beyond just sex but how i see sexuality and gender as a whole. Its not a joke and its not a fantasy. If its your fantasy then its not really rape, because u want it. When a woman rapes, and i can only speak for myself because its happened to me many times in my childhood and thats a fundamental part of it being a child, but when they do they do it in a way thats very clever and makes u confused if you were even violated. An older boy who is naturally interested in sex will be eager to do anything sexual, therefor the woman doesnt need to be predatory so its not the same i would say, after a boy starts to mature. Because women are usually more sensual they use your own senses against you (the predatory ones i mean). in my case, i was younger and the women were older of course. but what stuck with me the most was how much more colder and evil the process felt. It goes beyond being able to resist them physically. They cripple you emotionally and mentally in ways a man could never. Its just different. And being a guy, bwing raped by a true woman who knows what shes doing is wrong but doesnt care, its not just about sex. To me, it was more about how she could dominate and control me in everyway. Sometimes it would feel like hours of just perversion, forcing me not only to do things that werent always entirely sexual, but also trying to force me to feel certain things and a certaim way as well. And being a guy, well a boy, i knew it wasnt right for me to be experiencing some of the sensations and concepts she made me indulge in, but a woman is usually more thorough and less sloppy than a guy, typically. For these reasons i can never easily trust a woman again no matter who it is, because its hard to distinguish now between a normal woman and a predatory one, because they can hide their perversions in plain sight. nobody really thinks twice about a perverted woman as much as a perverted man. But i will add that women also usually have a deeper conscious, so to avoid the obvious feelings of guilt they invert the whole rape process. making me feel, subconsciously, that its my perversion thats making her want do these things. I didnt realize alot of this until years later when i truly realized that i was actually traumatized. Before that, i thought it was normal, in fact that i was lucky because i believed, despite how i actually felt, that i was priveledged to get those experiences sooner rather than later. She made me believe that. And its like what shes done to me left a stain on me somehow that other women can pick up on. Naturally, other women gravitate towards me its as of they can sense that ive been basically trained to know what to do and how to do it the way they want it. It makes me so anxious whenever im around a girl alone and i feel vulnerable all over again. I cant even focus on what i want or feel because im just expecting every girl will want what they wanted from me in the past, because thats what they told me too to fool me into believing it was all normal, that when i got older all the girls will appreciate me more. The actual sex is something i actually didnt really mind because obviously it felt good. But she told me why she let me do that and that it was more for me than for her, and i only got to do it after i satisfied her with other things she enjoyed alot more. This is all very weird and strange but its true this is my experience in life. Its not a game or a joke. And because of my pride i refuse to give them the satisfaction but i realize that its my own dysfunction and im projecting it outwards in defense. I know all women dont want to rape, but i feel like that and i know its wrong. i cant even hug my own mom or aunt or whatever without feeling a little weird and ive isolated myself from so many women because of it. My own mom for christs sake...and thats why im typing this so i can take the next step in trying to reverse the dysfunction in my own mind.

P.S. (read this after the comments) Once again you like the other before you are focusing on the word ""worse"". Its not about the word worse as i clarified what i meant by worse. Its ok to feel you need to protect people (if thats really what your trying to do) but real sufferers are not going to read my post and focus on one word and blow it out of proportion, picking on the semantics with little empathy or compassion. And i realize i shouldnt have asked for help from an internet thread  and i wasnt really looking for it either to be honest. Actually, im disappointed how negative you people are really, but thats your problem and not mine. My experience is my own and i do not try to pretend to know someone elses experience nor tell them how to feel about it. And i clarified very plainly what i meant about my experience is worse, is that it has been more difficult for me and other guys i know and heard from to actually get substantial help than girls sometimes. again these people have twisted the words into meaning something negative and thats ok really. I am not so weak to just as easily condemn them for voicing there opinions. The true sufferers will read my words and find the light in them. Alot of people do not like to hear the truth but the truth does not care about feelings it is only true. My female cousin was raped as well as some girls i know just from life and they have told me themselves they find it easier to gain support from other people and sympathy, numerous public help groups, etc than me, who is a guy which they rarely see if at all. And more guys come forward about being raped by other men than those bring raped by women and are being truthful. Ive heard from other sites some guys wishing and hoping to be raped by a woman, and although it offends me because of what i went through i understand where they are coming from. Its a fantasy many guys have. Again, i do not condemn them for it. There are even studies done dealing with this very topic as i am not the first guy to come forward with stuff like this. Whether you want to accept this truth or not is really not my problem.

To the real people who come across this you will see how quick they are to band together and silence the truth. Why disable comments on an innocent post when u can simply ignore it, (assuming there is some maturity in them). Instead they decide its more appropriate to take away my voice after slandering my words, to what good purpose does that serve?  Never have i in any post ""belittled"" or warranted extra ""sympathy"" from anyone. In fact i said to one commenter to not feel sorry me for it gives me no joy to make others feel sorry for me. But now i will say these people locked comments on MY own post because they feel offended. To them Its more about them, when all i tried to do was uplift ppl who dont really get any support from other avenues, like i havent. The very first person i told didnt believe me at all, and many after made jokes about it thinking that i was joking. All i was trying to say was that trying to get help from people emasculated me even further, and it wasnt until i threw away my pride and ego (easier said than done) and turned to god (my personal choice) that i was able to find little success with my problems almost 15 years and later and begin leading a better life. Perhaps i shouldnt say better as to belittle others people life, thats the argument they have presented to me, which is beside the point really. In fact they belittle me its really sad the immaturity on here. What i envisioned was a post reaching hundreds of comments with healthy discussions for people to feel empowered and speak freely without judgement. i wanted to hear other people describe there healing processes and what they went through in hopes to find common ground and unity...now this post has been killed with only 9 comments and most of them more combative than supportive. And it really was my fault for expecting maturity from trolls lol. Walk in truth people not deception and false sympathy. 
And i do have to show some sort of validation and give reasons and examples of how i suffered, because i know i got tired of trying to engage with other victims only to find out they were a troll in the end, and all i would feel after that was despair as if my suffering was a joke to the world. So in the end of this all, im sorry for saying anything. I will never post about this again, lesson to learn from this: the internet is not a healthy place to look for honest help and compassion.

As a teenager I was sleeping away from home for a summer program when I woke up to my roommate raping me. (To clarify, my rapist and I are the same gender.)

I spend over an hour trying to get to sleep and if they so much as breathe differently or get up for the bathroom I wake up panicking.

Problem: I got the opportunity to go to a training session this summer. It's a truly amazing and once in a lifetime kind of thing, very specialized and very expensive. But I will have to spend 5 nights sleeping around 1-3 strangers. I can't request a room to myself because there is not enough space.

Ned and Bill have a very on-off relationship; at times Ive heard they were dating, at times Ive heard they were just friends, other times Ive heard that Bill cheated on Ned, often Ned refuses to talk about Bill, often Ive seen them together chatting and hugging. So I'm quite confused at the situation at hand. My best friend stated that Bill ""pinned Ned down."" She refused to say any more on the topic. The way she said it made it seem . . . very unconsensual? Im not sure, so I asked another one of my friends, who also didn't want to talk about the matter. Previously, Bill had been pressuring Ned into experimenting. I also know that some girls find Bill quite off putting as he is too touchy feeling with them, and that recently Ned poured glue in Bill's locker, stating that he had cheated on him 3 times. Ned suffers from depression, and cuts. I've also heard Bill call ned a ""worthless cunt"" before. Everything seems to point to Ned being raped by Bill, but I still see them together and talking? 

I guess I want advice, really. I dont know how to bring up the matter with Ned, and me and Bill arent close. Im not sure if I should do anything untill someone says something for certain. Also, Ive talked to a friend of Bill's that said he was basically outed by his family for being gay, and that Bill has hardly anyone who actually likes him at school. Said friend also didnt seem to think that ned and bill were in a relationship at all, and that no cheating of the kind occurred. I think I need to get this off my chest, cause everything has been making me feel very upset for the past few days, and I dont know how to handle the situation - or if there really is a situation.

I also don't feel comfortable being vulnerable enough to tell someone about the experience and I'm scared I might have flashbacks and freak out while hooking up so I just avoid it to save myself an embarrassing experience. I just graduated college and every guy in Greek Life thought I was the biggest tease because I guess I'm pretty but never put out at parties or engaged in hookup culture. 


2) I live in a big city (NYC/LA/Chicago) and I spend a large portion of my income on an apartment in a nicer neighborhood to avoid street harassment. I've lived in other neighborhoods in the city and the constant catcalling and, at times, being followed makes me feel so exposed/uncomfortable that I can't handle it. The remarks are always about my physical appearance/body so I feel so uncomfortable. I know other neighborhoods are safe but I hate dealing with the loitering and constant derogatory and sexual comments.


3) I have such a twisted view of beauty, which is basically emaciated. I naturally had a hourglass figure and defined butt and I feel like that it has made me a target for unwanted attention so I have gone back and forth between these phases of binging to be overweight and super unattractive and underweight and, again, super unattractive. My ideal body would be the figure of a 14 year old, long distance runner, which wouldn't be attractive to most men (especially since I'm mixed ethnicity and there's an expectation on women that are Latina/Black/Middle Eastern to have curves). 


4) I'm always trying to be invisible, unnoticed. I don't take accolades or positive feedback well. I always say that I got lucky or a mistake was made acknowledging me. I'm always trying to minimize myself in hopes that it makes others more comfortable. This might be because my father was really abusive and when I was acknowledged it was b/c I did something ""wrong."" The good things I accomplished never were noticed so I've always walked on egg shells growing up.

-- I feel like the first three/four points don't seem super uncharacteristic of someone that has been sexually assaulted but this last one is one I am ashamed to share. --

5) I feel like being sexually assaulted has made me a bit racist. I was raped by two black guys (one was technically half black/half white) and I have an internal belief that I could never date/hookup with a black guy. It's so bad that I don't even entertain flirtation from or drink at parties where there's a large number of men of color. I feel so unsafe around men of color (especially in non-group settings). I feel like a hypocrite because I am a huge advocate for diversity (both gender and racial) in the workplace and I'm also half black (my parents are from Eritrea). I feel like recognizing this behavior and feeling like it's wrong and unfounded (obviously what happened to me isn't representative of a whole segment of the population's sentiments towards women) makes me feel like I'm maybe prejudice and not truly racist, but not sure and, still, I don't like the way this makes me feel and I want to get over it. 

Is that possible? Doesn't this rationalization make any sense from an outside perspective or does it seem totally bizarre? I've never talked to anyone about the assault and, tbh, I'm thinking of seeing a therapist about this but I'm afraid to share this. 

I've always been the studious, hardworking, accomplished person. Got all the ""right"" grades, had all the ""right"" internships/jobs but the fact that this happened to me makes me feel horrible. I never flirted, I never dressed promiscuously, or acted like I wanted it (not that these things make it okay) but I feel like it was my fault somehow. I also feel ashamed to talk about it because people see me in this super accomplished light and this diminishes from all of that and makes me feel like a victim of sorts, idrk. I feel like people would have less respect for me if they found out. I also feel like this makes me feel so unwomanly -- whenever I get hit on I say stop, I refer to myself as a child, etc. I feel like not having had consensual sex makes me feel like I'm not a real woman. 

I feel like this became a freewriting so apologies that this isn't very organized -- I just wanted to get some outside perspectives.",1523103365.0

Nobody knows.,3,7ltgrn,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/7ltgrn/i_was_raped_on_a_recent_special_occasion_right/,5,"Using a throwaway, I will be keeping some details intentionally vague in order to maintain anonymity. Warning: MAY BE GRAPHIC

I have a close friend who I have known for almost two years now, we have always had a platonic relationship and we have many mutual friends of all genders.

A couple of nights ago we went out to the bar together to celebrate certain recent/upcoming events. It was a normal night and everything was good. At the night's end I went to call an uber and saw it was outrageously expensive and asked how my friend was getting home, he said he would uber back with me to my apartment and then catch one from there back to his. I thought it was strange because my place was 20 minutes in the opposite direction of his and that would have been wildly inconvenient. I told him he could just crash on my couch and call it in the morning if he felt like he needed to.

Long story short back at my place I am very drunk and tired and he moves in to hold me and kiss me. I did not do anything to stop it but I told him I didn't want to have sex at all, he said okay. At one point he moved down to lick my pussy and I started saying no repeatedly even as he kept going and went through with it, when he stopped I asked why he did that and he said he ""wanted to do something fun"" and proceeded to start having sex with me until he came and when he stopped I was shaking and breathing heavily i was very upset. I got up and took a shower and slept on the couch.

I've been so afraid to say anything or tell anyone for days, I cried so much to next day and I feel broken and devastated, because i feel like I lost someone I trusted, but what's more is that I'm in a relationship with someone who I love with all my heart and it makes me sick to my stomach to think of him finding this out. It would destroy him and I would be absolutely devastated to lose him. I've been raped twice and sexually assaulted 4 times, my SO doesn't know about any of it. I don't want him to see me differently or think that I wanted to cheat on him, I feel so guilty that i didn't do anything to stop it and I feel like I am worthless and nothing. I just want to be normal for my family for the holidays but I feel sick every hour and I wish I was dead.

I have no idea what the first step is and I am falling apart inside. The day that all this happened was supposed to be a special and good day but instead it completely took the wind out of my sails. I don't want to go on if the one most important person in my life would stop loving me over this. And I'm devastated at the loss of a friend that both my SO and I trusted so well.

tl;dr: friend took it upon himself to overrule my explicit ""no"" when trying to hook up. my SO doesn't know and I feel broken and dead inside, terrified at the idea of losing my relationship and mourning the loss of a friendship.",1514121343.0
41,41,My father was accused.,7,6av6kq,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/6av6kq/my_father_was_accused/,5,"About a year ago my cousins found me on Facebook and messaged me. They claimed my father molested them, and wanted to know if I was ok. They apologized for never trying to talk to me or establish a relationship with me before and that this was the reason why.

I asked him straight up about this. He started crying and said it wasn't real. But I mean the more I think of it, some things are just really weird. When I was in high school I was doing a report, and went to open a file I saved my paper in and found child porn. He got my mom pregnant when she was 15 and he was 27. He's always been very fond of little girls, always trying to pick them up whenever he is near them and showering then with compliments, even strangers. I have an infant son. When we found out it was a boy he was so disappointed in the gender. One when I was pregnant night he got drunk and texted me how he wanted to be there when I gave birth and witness it which creeped me out.

As for myself, I mean I'm not sure if anything happened to me or not. I grew up not wanting to ever be touched by my parents and would run away screaming. But with my friends or grandparents or anyone else I knew and was close to I welcomed them. I would refuse to wear short sleeves or dresses or anything revealing my skin around them. I have fuzzy memories of being in a bathroom with a naked man but I just can't remember.

My mother in law is throwing my son his first birthday party later this year and I don't want to invite my dad cause there's gonna be lots of little girls there. I don't know if any of this is real or not!! I just want to protect them just in case, but I feel bad thinking about this and whether or not it's true.

Sorry. This is a really weird post. I don't usually post online about things. My hands are shaking as I type this. But I have no one to talk to about this or get advice from.

42,42,Perspective from a different view (this is a throwaway),7,6qa5y2,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/6qa5y2/perspective_from_a_different_view_this_is_a/,3,"It's been 7 months since the big incident happened. I'm told it will take years to overcome, but that is based on the ""average"".

Some background.
I am a man. I am an NCO. He was a non-military private civilian.  I am straight.

You may ask why the background is important.  Well, all four have to play into my experience over the last 7 months.

First, I am a Man.
Let's face it. When a lot, not all (this means you), think of this sub the first thing they think of is woman overpowered, often by a man. So when I try to talk to those in this community or others I either am first seen as someone who witnessed/supported a victim or am seen as the perpetrator until I explicitly say what happened, sometimes having to prove myself innocent to those close to me. The ones on here are often quick to offer support such as, ""I am so sorry that ____"".  It seems as though as the majority of people still think it can only happen to women, much like a lot of laws are sill written.  So I often find advocates for this community (people meaning well but not a part of this community so often have a bias) (I'm still not wanting to say victim/s,  see the end of the post for the reason, so I say community) will disregard men.  Thankfully, the people who do recognize men are the ones who are in the community and realize that community members are members regardless of age, race, gender, sex, orientation, or whatever else (Some don't, but most do). tl;dr for this para is that a lot don't consider men capable of being part of this community.

Second, I am an NCO.
Being a man plays into this.  There is a lot of ""hub-bub"" about sexual assault in the military, but the majority of the commotion is about women even though the majority of assault is against men.  This may be because of the hyper-masculine mindset of the military man and the lack of a comparison to women.  If a man comes forward, he is seen as different and weak, but if a woman comes forward, she is seen as normal and strong.  Now, I have never heard of a close-to Senior NCO coming forward, which is tough, since most are E-3 and below who come forward (Yes, O-3 and below may have come forward, but those are officers, the enlisted and officer world are two vastly different communities to compare).  This puts pressure on me to come forward to at least provide those at my rank and below the morale to come forward, especially when certain people say it is the duty of the experienced (see below for why I don't use synonym for affected party).  Every time I always ask my self, ""is this how I want my career to be?"".  Because even though they say it won't affect my career, I would probably be put into billets where I would have more interaction with SAPR (sexual assault, prevention, response) as opposed to what I am trying to do. At least this is the impression I get. To add on to this, how do I tell my men (ambiguous, as are terms, some interchanged from other services, to negate attribution to one service)?  I think I should try to do it as a father with this experience to a child. (not a father but what I would try to my child if I had one). tl;dr how do I act as an NCO, soon-to-be SNCO, despite this fact?

Third, he was a civilian.
To those outside the military, this may not seem like much, so I'll educate you.  The military is heavily drilled on not to commit sexual assault and about a tenth of that is what to do if you experience it.  The training only consists of you're the witness/rarely the one experiencing it.  And when it covers you experiencing it, about 95 percent of that considers it perpetrated by another service member.  So the last five percent is never covered in the training.  The training covers how to brings UCMJ charges against military perpetrators, how to report government civilians, but never how to report the random civilian.  Within in the military community I met that has a similar experience, all the perpetrators are military, not civilian.  Another thing I want non-military readers to know is that the military has a hierarchy of physical prowess, with civilians at the bottom and certain groups considering themselves at the top.  So this causes me to feel inadequate when I talk about it since I know ""the hierarchy"" and I know that he was weaker than me, even though when it happened I was in a weakened state.  It's a thing of Pride. Pride goes a looooong way in the military.

Fourth, not finally but all I can write right now, I am straight.
I obviously live in a pro-masculine,straight world where deviation is not uncommon but it is not normal.  There is one statistic that people like to tout,""One of the myths is that the perpetrators identify as gay, which is by and large not the case,"" but this is not true for me.  This guy identified himself at the beginning of the night as gay, which I didn't care as I have multiple friend that way, but after that I night I questioned all friends that were that way.  It ruined some of my friendships for a few months.  So when I here that ""fact"" it discourages me to come forward.  It's as if it's telling me not to come forward and get help.  It also makes me question myself.  Did I like it? Did I, because we ""act gay"" in the military, invite because he didn't understand that?

This is it.  I just want to give some perspective.  I may be back, I may not.  Good night.",1501350645.0

Also super long text ahead be aware

So a year ago my life pretty much got ruined. I think about the event pretty much every single day, dont think ive gone more than 3 without it popping up right before bed, on the bus, at work etc. 

Im sure in this sub gender equality is extremely reinforced and the thought train that both men and women can be taken advantage of but cmon, the real world isnt reddit. Any time i bring up my incident i get a ""oh damn, my buddy had something like that happen too"" followed with a wry smile and a subject change, and its all i can do to laugh and play along because i dont want to ruin this guys day with my story. 

So i guess i should get along with my experience: like i said, about a year ago my life changed. Im 20 years and a high functioning alcoholic. My best friend since highschool has this incredibly toxic girlfriend, just a terrible person. They were that on-and-off-just-call-it type that seems to just enjoy the drama. But i knew. I knew he just had an extreme fear of being alone. So he grabbed whatever girl said yes first and paused life with her. 

This girl (im gonna call her L) she had a crush on me, since she first me me i suspect, but really only ever advanced in college. L had my best friend approach me a couple times about a potential 3-way, i knew he wasnt remotely into that type of thing and neither am i. Obviously i said no every time. Few weeks pass by and the two get into their usual shit and break up. But this one seems different. He took it hard and i had this perverse hope that maybe, finally he had escaped her grasp. He and i go out to the bars looking for some distraction sex. Of course she's there but we cant leave, that'd mean she wins. So he proceeds to get very very drunk. At one point slips away to get a round or two. L jumps on this opportunity. She comes up to me and starts trying to seduce me. Its no secret to the two of them i do not like her as a person. But when i get drunk basically a hole is a hole. Im very dissenting and shut down all of her advances. But my buddy comes back and is a bit upset were conversing, also does not like that he has to talk to L. I ensure to him nothing is going on but idk something happens and he leaves. I assumed to get more drunk.

L didnt get any less persuasive. She continues trying to seduce me, saying things like, ""i cant help who im attracted to"" and, ""he and i arent togerther, whats wrong""? To attempt to curb my persistent dissent. 

I think like 2 or 3 days after that me and some other buddies go out drinking. L is out. I see her and tell my friends to not leave me alone with her, but fraternity brothers being what they are, we all want to get laid and we want our brothers to get laid. So as soon as she comes up to me they dip to leave us alone. 

Now she knows ive said no. She also knows how i am blackout drunk. I had like $20 for the night. So once that ran out she opened a tab. Continuing to buy me drinks. I mean i lost count after 14 but it was clear she had no intentions of stopping there...

Next thing i know im in her dorm and she's bent over. Drunkenly i ask who are you, laughning, she replies, ""L, cmon i just sucked your cock and you dont even remember my name hahaha"". I immediately go flaccid as i sober back up a bit, and lay down and pass out. Next thing i know my best friend is barging in screaming about what were doing and how fucked in the head i am, and we start fighting. Cops get called and he talks to them about how its really a domestic thing and were working it out. He starts berating me about how could i do this and im a terrible person and i just take it... because i just fucked his girlfriend. What the fuck is wrong with me i fucked my best friends girlfriend. Our relationship is mended but its not the same. I dont think it really can be. And i dont know what to do

44,44,"My story, my 8 year relationship and repeated abuse.",5,6pt7cv,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/6pt7cv/my_story_my_8_year_relationship_and_repeated_abuse/,1,"I was with my previous partner for 8 years until 4 months ago. The last 4 years he was emotionally abusive to me and for the last two years he repeatedly sexually assaulted me. I'm realizing now he used several years of our relationship to make me feel like nothing. He would frequently insult my intellect and my confidence. If I didn't do something 'just right' or his way I was screamed at until I was curled up in a ball on the floor. When I went into therapy for suicidal tendencies he insisted I tell him what I had said about him. Because of this, the 8 months I was in therapy I never spoke about him. He got me into the kink community and taught me the ettiquette (most folks I met in the community were wonderful people, this is not a comment on kink). After participating in kinky acts for a few months he told me his fantasy was to make me cry during sex. I didn't want to put him down for it, but I said I didn't really want to do that. The next time we were intimate he hit my harder than before and ignored my safe word cries, my 'stop's and 'no's. After he was done he just cuddled me like nothing happened. I was sobbing and he just said, ""Thanks for letting me do that."" I didn't let him. He overpowered me, hurt me, and violated my consent.


But before this he was repeatedly gaslighting me. He would talk about how bad my memory was- he made me not trust myself. After the first sexual assault I felt like I must be crazy. I had such a poor opinion of myself that I doubted my actual experience and memory more than his words. After this it seemed like every other intimate encounter involved him hurting me to get off. I tried to break up with him twice over the next few years, but each time he said he'd kill himself if I left.


About 6 months ago he invited a new person into our relationship. It was made very clear in the beginning that this new addition is just for him, not just because of him, but the new partner wasn't attracted to women. But when I met them they were a wonderful human being. We hung out together and became fast friends. I did love them, but didn't pursue it because I knew they wouldn't want me in that way. Two weeks into them living with us, he manipulated us into having a threesome. Telling each of us separately that the other would be crushed if we didn't participate. After this, the new partner explained that they loved me and my body, they had just had bad experiences with women before. We slept together and had rough, consensual sex. When my partner saw the light bruises from that encounter he said, ""If he can mark you up then so can I."" This was the worst he ever hurt me. I had deep, painful bruises that he was careful to leave only in places that would be covered by clothing. In my head I still didn't see it as rape, but rather as him losing control.


I was afraid of telling the new partner about it, so I didn't. A few days later they approached me about how emotionally abusive he was towards me. They had seen first hand how he treated me at home and how I let him walk all over me. On top of the emotional abuse, they pointed out how I worked full-time, went to school, and took care of chores while he worked a part-time job. We talked for hours about how he had emotionally abused me over the years. This conversation led me to the realization I needed to break up with him. The new partner was with me when I broke up with him, they broke up with him too. He acted calm at first, but over the next few weeks he would fly into fits of rage beating the furniture and walls- at one point hacking up a laundry basket with a machete. After the break-up I tried to talk to one of my friends about the emotional abuse but she just said, ""But he's so nice?"" as if he wasn't capable of hurting me.


My new partner and I had to live there while we searched for a new place. After a month of no luck in the town we were in and him growing increasingly hostile, we had to moved 18 hours away. I left him with most of my possessions and $400 (I felt financially responsible for him, I didn't want him to become financially unstable, I regret this decision).


I moved to a better place, landed my dream job in a month, and live happily and comfortably with my new partner. Last week I slipped up when telling him about the last thing my ex said before assaulting me. I originally made it sound consensual but I told him the truth. He asked me if I felt violated, if I had said 'no'. I told him yes but my ex probably felt like he had access to my body in whatever circumstances. My new partner then asked me what I would say to someone in my situation. I'm a class, race, gender, and sexuality studies major- it hit me very suddenly that I was actually assaulted. A few days later I realized he had been doing it for years, just the last time it happened it was the worst.


Since I've realized this I've felt extremely empty. I feel like I just let it happen. I never told anyone, I never went to the police. I know I can't get any justice because I was with him for years and there is no evidence. I feel broken and ashamed. Shame from the experience but also from having so little value in myself that I'd let it happen for so long. My new partner is very supportive, they are also a survivor of sexual assault. I don't really know where to start on healing. For the first time in a while I've thought suicide again. I'm torn between not wanting to deal with any of this and and not wanting to let him win.


I am looking for advice, I don't know where to go from here.


I've also pasted this on r/rapecounseling. I don't know if that's against the rules but I really need help.

I was sexually molested by a familiar of the same age and gender when I was a child. I honestly dont know how to describe it, maybe it was rape, maybe it was assault. I was to week to do anything and to scared to fight back or argue against it. I eventually did and it stopped for a while. At the time this was happening(maybe around 6) I did not start to develop sexually yet. A couple years later(maybe 8 or 9 years old) I was starting to develop sexually and started to become interested in girls and also straight porn. I had never even considered having sex with other male. Thats my cousin also being at the same age and im assuming also developing came back to me and sadly I was more willing to do it. He was one of my best friends and I guess I didnt mind doing it this time. This continued on for another year or two and eventually that stopped when my parents caught us. Ever since then I cant help but blame my attraction to the same sex on him? Gradually over the years I became more and more attracted to guys and its gotten to the point that I'm probably bisexual and I hate that this is happening. I'm currently 19 now and im hoping that this is just a phase that I can grow out of.

46,46,"""Do I have to rape you?""",7,4h6kpu,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/4h6kpu/do_i_have_to_rape_you/,1,"I'd just like to start with a general trigger warning for any one who's ever experienced sexual assault, and apologies for the long text. I'm writing this mainly as a way for me to process and be able to gather my thoughts around this, which is hard to do, even eight years after it happened.

I was assaulted and raped in 2008. At that time I was 13 years old, and assaulted by a stranger on a construction site right near my house. I won't go into any detail about this, mainly because I don't remember much, even with intensive therapy. What I do remember is that I had been hanging out on a lot of pages I wasn't supposed to, talking to a lot of guys that were older than me, and one in particular came to mind when I was asked who did this. He lived just two minutes away from my house, and was 21 at the time. We never met, and to this day I still don't know exactly what he looks like. I never disclosed this to the police. I was far too scared to wrongfully accuse a stranger I'd only talked to a few times online of something he didn't do. 

This experience completely ruined me. I used to be the kind of kid that would quite literally jump around in the streets, singing. That awkward kid that had no social skills at all, but still was pretty damn close to normal. After this I broke up with my boyfriend (who was 16 - which tells you a great deal about what kind of crowd I was hanging in) because I felt guilty. I couldn't concentrate in class, and everything was going to shit. Two months after it happened, I broke. I'll never forget what it feels like to watch your parents cry about something that happened to you. I've never felt more guilty in my entire life. 

So I was sent to therapy. My therapist was kind, but not very good. She kept focusing on different things that had nothing to do with the assault. In retrospect I honestly think she didn't believe that I was raped. I can see why, as I was withholding information from everyone with me having been online on pages that I shouldn't have, etc. So with all those holes, there is no wonder my story didn't seem very credible.

The day after I finished therapy my friend and I were hanging out, when an old childhood friend of mine showed up all of a sudden. He was two years older than me (which made him 15), and we decided to hang out with him. We went to my room, talked and had fun. I even flirted with him a little, since he seemed interested. The thought of physical contact scared me, though. So I tried to avoid it, but it turned out to be difficult. He was clingy, and I was scared that if I said no, he would just continue. So instead of saying no, I just let him. It was harmless. 

Eventually my best friend had to go. We walked her home, and sat down on a bench behind a building. He started kissing me, and though I tried to pull back, I realized kissing wasn't as scary as I thought. Actually, I almost kind of liked it. Up until one point. He kept touching me in places I didn't want him to, so I pulled away and said no. I didn't laugh, and I communicated that I was uncomfortable very firmly. 

But he didn't stop. He kept trying, and got very vocal about it. Told me that he knew I wanted to, and that he could tell that I liked it. At this point I was really scared. He'd always been weird, and had a anger management issue that I had been subject to before, and I didn't want to experience again. By this point his hands were down my pants, and I tried again to communicate that I didn't want to. I said no to every advance he made, but as I had been afraid of previously, that didn't stop him. Eventually I told him I had to go home, as I had promised my parents I'd be home for dinner. 

He stopped for a second, and said something along the lines of: ""Just once? I have a condom, it doesn't last very long."" Again I said no, and he was obviously getting irritated. By this point I was so scared that my only way of describing it is that it felt as if I was out of my body just observing the situation. I kept looking for ways to get out, but there was none. Then he mouthed the words that I probably will never forget. ""Do I have to rape you?"" 

I froze. I didn't respond or say anything the rest of the time. He did what he needed. Then he left, kissing my cheek as if we were all good. I went home, had dinner and went to bed as if nothing remotely important had happened. 

This is what sticks with me. While experiencing the first rape was horrible (there are no words to describe), and there still isn't a day that go by that I don't think of it, it's so much harder to feel like a victim when it comes to the second one. I even struggle with calling it a rape to this day, even though it so clearly is. Being a feminist, these feelings are especially difficult. Mostly because I know I was assaulted, I know that it was not my fault and that I did what most other girls my age would have done in that very situation given my experience only 6 months earlier. 

I had to move three times because of this. The first time because I couldn't stand sleeping in the house knowing very well that I had been raped twice within a mile of it. Both spots are visible from my parents house. Mind you, I used to live in a very small town. The second time as an adult because his dad moved into the apartment over me and my (now ex)boyfriend. Finally I decided to just leave the town all together. 

Every time I go to see my parents, I'm terrified. I rarely leave the house when I'm there except to get in a car. This is after years of therapy, and even without any more extreme PTSD-symptoms. I had nightmares for 6 years about both the assaults, generally several times a night. I've been in and out of hospitals, I've self harmed for eight years and I'm still uncomfortable whenever I walk alone or hang out with someone I don't know very well - no matter what gender they are. These experiences has come pretty damn close to ruining my life. 

But then there is always the small feeling. I can feel it right now. The need to justify his actions. Both of their actions. I've probably already done it in the text without noticing. Every time I talk about rape I try and justify what they did. What if this wasn't rape? Have I gone around my entire adult life accusing an innocent man? Did I ruin his life? I wish there was some way to shut those thoughts up forever, but I'm getting scared there isn't. I really don't know what to do about it anymore. I've learned to live with it. But I know very damn well that I shouldn't have to. ",1462084948.0

It was deleted and this sub was recommended instead. I didn't know about this sub at the time so if some of my post goes a bit off topic, I am sorry.
 
Anyway on to the subject. I'll try and be direct as possible. I'm a 28 male and I have a seemingly endless list of problems both internally and externally (I know, join the club right?). I don't really know where to begin...
Pretty much since as long as I can remember I've been incredibly anxious and easily upset. When I was a child I'd cry pretty much constantly at the smallest thing, I'd hide if I had to meet or to someone new, I'd go from the happiest child to inconsolable within seconds. That is somewhat true even now.

Well I think that's true anyway. There are so many holes in my childhood memories. I don't remember any of the happy things we all had as a family, I only remember feeling sad, feeling alone, feeling anxious. I have a very vivid memory of being around 10 and watching Austin Powers repeatedly on VHS, remember the scene with the steamroller? The henchman dies comically and it cuts to a super melodramatic scene with a child who is told his stepdad dies. I remember being so mad at that kid, I'd shout at the screen ""at least you have something! You have a reason! I'm crying and I don't know why!"".

I have always had...problems with my anus. God I cringe at saying this but I to this day have problems with poo...staying in. I'll wipe and wipe and wipe until it bleeds. Then 30 minutes later I feel as if I'm...leaking. I've had to back out of social events when I was young (try explaining that to your parents) literally for that reason, I was so sore down there I couldn't compete in whatever physical activity it was at the time. I still do to this day, though not quite as severe. It's only recently I've begun to realise how not normal that is.

I live in the same city as my parents and my sister, they're all quite close and see each other a few times a week. I speak to them maybe once twice a month and see them a few times a year. They're a 10 minute drive away. They used to try and get in touch but have just over time accepted that I don't want to be in contact with them. From what I can objectively tell they're loving, caring parents -  not perfect, far from it, but I know they care and do their best. My sister is outgoing and close to my parents. I feel so detached from all of it.

That feeling I have for my family reflect how I feel about everyone. I sit at my computer, I drink and I smoke weed whenever I can (when I don't need to go to work), I'm twitchy, uncomfortable, can't breathe properly. I seem to have this habit of exhaling in quick bursts. I'm never fully relaxed, always slightly on edge, I never feel safe, occasionally I get an eerie feeling like someone is behind me, looking over me.

I have a messed up sex life. I am pretty much exclusively attracted pre-op transexuals, best sex as I've ever had is to experience domination with a tgirl. I've had a few female girlfriends, the sex is good. I've been with a few guys, the sex was...odd. Tgirls though seems to be the only gender I'm truly attracted to. I don't know why or when but I've come to accept it.

Anyway, I have an appointment with my Doctor next week, I'm going to ask/beg to be referred to a psychiatrist. I was also considering maybe going to an STD clinic on the off chance they'll be able to look for signs of uh...damage? I'm sorry I'm not sure how to word it. I'm also currently scared to google it.

I don't know what I'm looking to gain by writing this out, I guess I just wanted someone to hear it, because I have nobody I can tell this to right now, so if you read all the way through, thank you very much.
If I can't fix how I feel, I fully expect to find a quiet way to kill myself at some point down the line. I don't mean that so sound dramatic, I just  know I can't keep living the way I do, constantly feeling live I'm on hot coal. I guess I'll trudge along for a few more years to see if it get's better.

TL;DR Realised recently I may have been raped as a young boy and have blocked it out, suffered pretty severe emotional trauma all of my life, only just now realising that it isn't normal. Some minor physical issues also. Or it could all be in my head.

I've only told a couple people (including my boyfriend) because I know I can't handle the ""well I know it's not your fault, but you shouldn't have been hanging around those people"" kind of comments; especially because I still have feelings of guilt and shame. I went to a support group a couple times, but other than that I've only tried to deal with it on my own. Most of the time I feel fine but then something will happen and a panic attack/flashback will hit me like a ton of bricks. After something like that I will be a mess for a few weeks--irritable, random breakdowns, dissociation and a lot of lashing out. 

My biggest issue, though, is my subconscious anger toward men. I have two or three girlfriends who I'm not that close with, but about 15 good male friends. I love men and tend to connect with them much more than women; however, any girl who hangs out with guys the majority of the time knows about those ignorant comments and conversations that come up now and then. I just get so mad and get into heated arguments about really small shit if it is the tiniest bit sexist. No one knows about my rapes so I just come across as another irrational, raving feminist. I don't hate men, I just want the good ones to understand the unfairness that does exist instead of pretending that everything's all rainbows and butterflies because it's 2014. I know it's not my job to educate everyone and I don't want to because it only makes their uncaring worse. I also have dated much older men and know that as men age they tend to sympathize with women more. 

I just don't know how to separate myself from these conversations (they are unavoidable), I just want to hide in a hole where there is no gender. I want to look at people as individuals and stop thinking in terms of ""men vs. women"" but I just can't stop. I hate it and I can't stand myself and I just want to chill out and be likable again and know I can get drunk without going on a rant.

49,49,I was raped. It strained my relationship. (sorta X-Post from /r/MenCanGetRapedToo,3,2nqyug,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/2nqyug/i_was_raped_it_strained_my_relationship_sorta/,3,"I was in a relationship with someone who I loved very much. I still love her to this day. Although, it was not my rape that ended the relationship, it put a whole lot of strain on it.

I was looking for more friends in my area. I was in college and all of my high school friends had either joined the military or had moved out of state/country for college. My girlfriend lived in a town not too far away (But far enough for us that relocating would be difficult). Neither of us could move together because jobs were scarce, so we kept a relationship without living with each other. At the time, we had been together for 2 years, and happily so. I found a group of people through meetup, who played Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, and a few other table top role playing games. My girlfriend went to these games, too. Or at least she tried to, we both had weird work schedules, and the games happened to fall into my favor. There was this one woman there, who was... 5'4"" and Morbidly obese. 300 pounds or so. I didn't know anything about her, other than her name (Who I like to refer to as ""The bitch"" or ""the thing"") the whole circle of people was new to us.

My girlfriend at the time said that she was... Weird. There was something about her that she just could not get over. She didn't like her. I'm the kind of person who likes to give the benefit of the doubt and try to see good in others, give people a chance. All of that cliche stuff. This bitch was jealous of my girlfriend. The woman wanted me more than anything. I have no idea why, I was just being as friendly to her as I was everyone else. I had no idea what she saw in me other than an acquaintance that played table top role playing games in her group. However, she was respectable enough to not approach me. But I can tell with how she looked at me... and how she acted around my girlfriend. I did stand up for her, and told her to cut that shit out, but she only threw a fit.


One time, my girlfriend wasn't there for a game, she had to work. The person who often gave the bitch a ride to and from the games had to leave early because something came up with his son, and the bitch wanted to stay. I opted to give the bitch a ride back home, since it was only about 5 minutes from where I lived, anyway (Quite literally around the corner).

That's when she lured me into her apartment. ""Let's hang out for a while."" I thought she was being just a friend. I was desperate for friendship and because of her proximity and despite her attraction to me, I thought she would be a good friend. Especially when (and if) she got the hint that I was never, ever going to be with her. Ever.

I TRUSTED that she was being just a friend.
I remember leaving afterwards, in a haze. I don't even remember making it home. It was like I snapped out of it in the shower. When I got out, I realized my girlfriend had blown up my phone. She left messages, begging me to come over. I don't even remember making it to her house. But I do know we made love that night.

I hid it from her for about 2 months, because I was so scared of how she would react. She knew something as up when I shirked away from intimacy.... I was afraid it would affect or ultimately ruin our relationship. I was afraid that she would think I was lying. That what happened was consensual.

It wasn't. [WARNING. IT'S EXPLICIT FROM HERE] The bitch used her weight against me. She stimulated me. She MADE me hard whether I wanted to be or not. I didn't want it. I wasn't sexually attracted to her. I was loyal to my beautiful, loving girlfriend, soon to be wife who was the whole entire world to me. Eventually, I told my girlfriend about the rape. I put the blame on myself. I STILL do. ""I shouldn't have been in her apartment"" I said ""It's all my fault, I should have done more to protect myself."" She was angry, in a sort of told-you-so way for like .5 seconds. But soon she was embracing me and sobbing. I was sobbing, too. I sobbed like a fucking baby. I felt vulnerable and raw. It was the most horrible thing I've ever felt in my life. It made me wish I had told her earlier. It made me wish I had never met the thing.

From then on, it was a slow healing process. I could not get intimate with my lover for the longest time. For some reason, I would panic every time I was touched... It took a long time before I could get intimate with her again. It took a long time before I could even put that trust in MY OWN LOVER again. Not only that, but it made me so distant... It put a strain in our relationship; even though it did not end it. (That is another very long story.)

I still have a very hard time making new friends. I have a hard time going back to the group (who knows what she did, and banned her from future games) and entrusting either of them. I have developed a social anxiety.

I hate how people look at rape for any gender. ""If you got hard/got wet, you obviously wanted it."" Bullshit. When was the last time you got (physically) aroused when you didn't want to? When you knew it was wrong? When it was inappropriate? When was the last time you could 100% control your anatomy?

When your seat vibrates in the car or airplane. When your boxers rub against your junk. When shit -just happens- when you don't want it to. You -obviously- want sex then, right? No? Then move the fuck on.

That woman. That thing made me ejaculate whether I wanted to or not. People say ""there is no such thing as a bad orgasm."" Yes. Yes there is. A bad orgasm is an orgasm you know you're not supposed to have. A bad orgasm is an orgasm that makes you feel rotten inside. Violated. Taken advantage of. Ashamed. That one bad orgasm reroutes everything you feel about future orgasms. You have to retrain yourself to NOT feel that way ever again. It took even longer to enjoy sex, it took even longer to not have depression or shame after I ejaculated.


Then there's the fear I endured. ""Did I get an STD? Did I impregnate her?"" If I impregnated the thing (since a condom wasn't used), I would have honest to god killed myself. If I got an STD... I don't know what I would have done. I don't know if I could have lived with that sort of constant, visceral reminder of what the bitch had done to me. The rest of that year alone was the worst hell I had ever been in.

""But you came. You obviously enjoyed it."" This is all a natural, physical response to excess stimuli. This happens whether or not the stimulation is enjoyable. We are animals. We have EVOLVED to BREED. We are SEXUAL BEINGS. Of course we are going to get aroused when stimulated. Of course we're going to orgasm when stimulated enough. It's a biological FUCKING RESPONSE. The difference is the CONSENT and the psychological enjoyment thereof.
And this is where I don't understand why people think others lie about being raped. Why people blame the victim. Sure, they chose to trust that person. They CHOSE to go into that house or apartment. They CHOSE to get intoxicated. They CHOSE to wear that thing and they were ""asking for it"". They CHOSE to go out with that creepy guy, or ""she's way too into me"" girl.

But that predator chose their prey. and the prey doesn't know that they ARE prey until it's too late.

You shouldn't have to put your trust in someone, only to have your trust in them and more importantly, in future persons destroyed, shattered, violated, killed. Raped...

50,50,Was this sexual assault or rape or something else?,1,4mcl1b,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/4mcl1b/was_this_sexual_assault_or_rape_or_something_else/,1,"Long story. I'm a 26 year old male. I've been in a healthy relationship for 7 years. 

About 4 years ago I met Sally (not real name). We hit it off almost immediately. I really liked her a lot and had a bit of a crush on her but I didn't want to cheat on my gf [I found out much later that my GF had cheated on me with Sally's BF but that's another story].

One night Sally and I went out for drinks. We were flirting all night long and I had way to much to drink. I started vomiting at the bar we were at. I had to be carried around by Sally and other friends. I stumbled back to Sally's house with her and offered to get a cab back to my place but said I was being silly and that I should just crash with her.

She took me into her bedroom and I kinda just fell over onto the bed. She told me to take my pants off but I was still so out of it that I couldn't (you know how it is when your really drunk and you fall into your bed with your clothes on) so she did it for me.

I don't really remember everything that happened after. I know we started off by just cuddling which turned into grinding against each other. I was into it for a bit but really didn't want it to go to far because I didn't want to cheat on my GF. [back then I saw myself as the kind of person who keeps his promises and so the idea of having an full blown affair was anathema to me - although My GF and I were starting to experiment with being open about stuff. Sally and I had made out at parties before with my GF's blessing so I figured I could do some stuff with her but I didn't want to go to far. These days I don't have any moral prohibitions against infidelity]

I remember thinking that i should stop this, I remember trying to think of ways to make it stop. I remember thinking that I should just try and think of something else - in my head I tried to imagine being elsewhere and doing other things.

I know that if I asked her to stop she probably would have. But simply asking never really occurred to me. 

When she climbed on-top of me and started grinding against my leg I figured that she wasn't going to stop until she came so I took her hand and put it down into her panties and inside of her to help her masturbate until she came.

As I walked home the next morning I asked myself if I had the capacity to consent. I never answered that question for myself. Sally was a huge feminist and had gotten me into feminism. She was a advocate against sexual violence and was a rape victim herself. I trusted he judgement implicitly and figured that she must have known that I had capacity to consent otherwise she wouldn't have done it.

I got home and immediately told my GF what had happened (I didn't tell her about how drunk I was, just what I did). She wasn't annoyed at me and told me that she figured something like this might happen and she was okay with it.

Years later I saw Sally abusing her GF, then I realized that Sally was being abusive to me. When Sally became violent to me I ended the friendship. Since then every time I here about her she's done something else to make me loose respect for her (she has done some truly nasty things: once she pretended to me that she was dying just to fuck with my head and attempt to seduce my GF who was just made really uncomfortable by her drunken advances)

I don't know when it happened but at some point a few months ago it kinda hit me that maybe I didn't have capacity to consent that night all those years ago! Maybe she took advantage of me!

I want to know;

Did I have capacity to consent?
If not, was this rape or sexual assault?
Was I to blame for this - was I partially culpable?
Am I being utterly ridiculous and is me even asking this question an insult to 'real' rape victims (one of my friends said that me accusing her of being domestically violent was an insult to 'real victims' of domestic violence)
- Does gender or politics matter at all here? I'm a man and she's a woman. Also she is a pretty hardcore feminist (doing MA in Gender Studies). Does this impact on how I should see this?",1464984960.0

Also how do I comfort my guy friend about his potential sexual assault? 


I previously posted to /r/twoxchromosomes but found my question deleted before I could get any real advice. I feel lost, deeply disturbed and clueless.


My friend K was having her 21st birthday. As per tradition she proceeds to get obliterated. My friend K is known for enjoying one night stands (which is totally fine!). She was sharing a hotel room with my other friend J. This next part is an account from J.
K decided to bring C, the male friend in question, back to the hotel room and they proceed to have what J thinks is loud rough sex. J said there was a lot of dirty talk exchanged like ""Mm do you want my dick in you"", etc.


However when the act is over and K passes out from being drunk, J finds C and is surprised to see him weeping.
C is not incredibly intoxicated, maybe tipsy at best. He is a fairly sturdy guy, typical kind of ""bro-ish"" dude. And he is sobbing like a little baby. In between crying, he's saying ""I didn't want to do that."" over and over again.


My friend K, has a reputation for being aggressive with her lovers. The next morning she shows us the bruises on her chest while laughing them off as hickies. However, the bruises on her chest are very obviously handmarks. Like someone grabbed her really hard... maybe to throw her off...


I don't know what to do or say to either one of them. Mostly, to K. How do you even approach this? Like, Hey K! You raped C this weekend!


C has pretty much seemed to repress it, he seems normal now but I kind of wonder. I'm in a part of America that is pretty conservative and I don't even think male rape is something that is on people's radars here. I feel bothered that no one is doing anything but kind of talking about this in hushed voices. I feel like if the genders were switched, things would be different.


EDIT: I'm getting a lot of messages and comments saying I should not use the words ""sexual assault"" because it is not correct and I could be skewing what this whole situation is. You're right, I don't know a lot of what went down because I am not K or C. I am only asking this question because I am trying to find out more info but don't know HOW to approach either or them because it's a topic I am unfamiliar with and because of how unclear everything is. Believe me, if it was a clear cut sexual assault I would've gone to the police YESTERDAY regardless of gender. But I cannot take action until I know more about what happened. J only told me about this because I am good mutual friends with both parties involved while she is not.

Update: Don't know if anyone will actually be able to see this but... I talked to C
C told me that the bruises on K's chest were from him repeatedly try to shove her off. She is a lot bigger than him and he told me that at one point she passed out on top of him and he had to shove her off, snoring, with great effort to get free. He told me he was scared as hell because of how blunt she was about the sex. He tried dirty talking to get into it because it kind of never occurred to him he had the option to say no or stop it. He went soft and was unable to finish.... Furthermore she lied to him and said she was on birth control when she isn't. He doesn't want police to be involved but he certainly doesn't want to talk to K anymore.
So my suspicions were correct.

But now I'm at a bigger loss at what to do.
