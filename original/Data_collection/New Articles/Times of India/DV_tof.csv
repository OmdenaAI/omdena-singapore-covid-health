",Delhi third in domestic violence cases: Study,"NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded the highest number of domestic violence cases during the nearly two-months-long lockdown period, lagging behind only Uttarakhand and Haryana. In a first of its kind effort to document who needed legal aid during the lockdown, the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) has documented cases till May 15 under various categories, including domestic violence, in which Delhi saw 63 cases where distraught women reached out to counsellors seeking immediate help. NALSA, that reports to its executive chairman, Supreme Court Justice N V Ramana, compiled the paper after collecting data from 28 different State Legal Services Authorities (SLSAs). On domestic violence, the report shows only Uttarakhand (144) and Haryana (79) are the two full fledged states that witnessed more cases of domestic violence than the capital during lockdown. Detailing the break up of legal help extended, the report says NALSA units reached out to tenants facing eviction, migrants, labourers denied wages and prisoners. For instance, around 60,000 inmates (under trial prisoners and convicts) were released on bail or parole during the lockdown, in a bid to decongest jails to lower coronavirus threat where NALSA and state units played an active role. As per the report, a total of 42,259 undertrial prisoners were released from jails across the country during the lockdown period where Uttar Pradesh released highest number of 9,977. Delhi’s legal aid services worked to secure release of 2,177 UTPs and 1,010 convicts, apart from deputing legal aid lawyers for 250 newly arrested persons at remand stage.

DGP, Himachal Pradesh, S R Mardi said that cases of domestic violence have increased during the lockdown and curfew period. He said that people should try to adjust with each other at this critical juncture and should maintain balance by exercising restrain. “Many cases of domestic violence/abuse are being reported during the period of lockdown since the abuser/perpetrator and the victim may have been confined within the same physical space due to the imposition of curfew,” said the order issued on Sunday by Kangra District Magistrate Rakesh Kumar Prajapati.

",Raipur police's 'Chuppitod' campaign to deal with domestic violence survivors,"RAIPUR: Raipur police's unique ‘Chuppitod’ campaign to deal with domestic violence during the lockdown has disposed of over 995 cases, including 128 cases from men. The viral toll-free numbers of the campaign on social media has also given assistance to people in other states to call up and inform the crime to police. Team of cops is trying to contact all complainants in past three years to check about their well-being during the lockdown. Launched on April 24, the campaign is gearing up people to approach the Chuppitod desk on its helpline numbers. According to Raipur SSP Arif Sheikh, ""The uniqueness of the campaign is that the records of the last three years related to domestic violence are checked and police are tapping on each survivor to know about their well-being. The period of lockdown has triggered a lot of disappointment on human psychology and suppressed anger is coming to the surface, leading to domestic violence and quarrels in families."" ""So, it is important to know if other survivors are doing well. Of the previously registered 1,500 cases, police have contacted 995 survivors of the domestic violence in the past few days and the victims ensure they are doing well. Besides the calls, we are receiving there are complaints received from the previous cases as well when tapped on them,"" Sheikh said. Over 55 cases have been reported via WhatsApp and calls since the launch of campaign and were dealt by the team of cops and experts by visiting their homes and counselling to settle the matter. Nearly two FIRs were lodged and preventive action was taken against five. It came as a surprise when the team received calls from Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan also. Complainants told that they came to learn about the campaign and helpline number through the social media. They were counselled over phone and their cases were forwarded to their respective police stations in their towns. There are cases where landlady or neighbours called up the police team to inform about the domestic violence incidents on a woman by in-laws or husband and action was taken against them. The SSP said, ""As we receive complaint, we first try to counsel over phone, then we go to the spot and initiate counselling and decipher the seriousness of situation. If the case is very serious and it seems it's a threat to the safety of survivor, a case is registered and further action is taken."" When men contact with complaints, it majorly covers the quarrel over frustration of being locked at home. When the wives threaten of committing suicide or behave strange, men contact police in hurry. They have been contacting the Chuppitod desk on its helpline numbers--0771-4247110, 9479190167 or Whatsapp on 9479191250. "

This was not the case earlier She said apart from calls to the police helpline numbers, she was also receiving at least one call daily on her mobile number. In view of the increasing domestic violence cases, the state women commission has now launched a domestic violence helpline-cum-WhatsApp number i.e. 7814103253. Those in need of help can also send email on punjabwomencommission@gmail.com. Gulati said she is making arrangements for at least one or two staff members of the commission to start going to the office from Wednesday. ""The major problem is that all the male members of the family are stuck in their homes. A little stress in the relationship can now take a toll which can lead to depression, anxiety, physical violence or even suicide,"" said the chairperson. Such a situation has made it difficult for victims to stay at home. She said most of the complaints being received by the commission are from well educated women. ""Imagine the condition of women living in villages and who do not have access to mobile or email since they cannot even send a letter to the commission's address because of the curfew,"" says Gulati. The commission used to receive an average of 50 complaints per day through letters from various parts of the state before the curfew was imposed.

",Odisha police to call up victims of domestic violence to know their well-being,"BHUBANESWAR: The Odisha police have decided to launch a ‘phone-up’ programme where cops will call up women, who were earlier subjected to domestic violence, and verify their well-being during the lockdown period. The novel initiative was conceptualized after chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Tuesday expressed concern over rising incidents of domestic violence in the country and asked police to take stringent action against the culprits. DGP Abhay said the “phone-up programme” will be implemented through the state level call centre of state crime records bureau (SCRB). Notably, the call centre was set up at SCRB here last year under the state government’s Mo Sarkar (my government) initiative to receive feedback from complainants about police conduct and service in police stations across the state. Police sources said the SCRB call centre has already retrieved FIRs, related to domestic violence of 2018, 2019 and 2020 (till now). “We will make telephone calls to the victims of domestic violence and find out their well-being. If we find that they continue to undergo torture or harassment in houses, we will send police officers of the concerned areas for verification. SCRB call centre will intimate such matters to deputy superintendents of police or additional superintendents of police of investigation unit for crime against women (IUCAW) for follow-up action,” another senior police officer said. After Naveen’s concern, Odisha police have started providing services to victims of domestic violence at doorstep. Police personnel have been collecting complaints from the victims from their homes and delivering FIR copies to them at doorstep. The state women and child development department on Wednesday launched a WhatsApp number (7205006039) to report domestic violence cases. The state commission for women (SCW) too on Thursday came up with its helpline number (8763543013) to address the issues of women facing domestic violence. "

",Steep increase in domestic violence cases,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Figures from multiple women facilitation centres dealing with domestic violence and sexual harassment show that there has been a steep increase in the number of reported incidents during the lockdown period. The calls and complaints received in the toll-free numbers of Mitra, Sakhi one-stop centre, women’s commission, and Mahila Samakhya, reporting domestic violence, have shown a substantial increase as per figures compiled by the women and child development department. In 181 Mitra, which is the national toll-free number, the calls made and cases registered have doubled since March. While 220 calls were made to the number in March and 56 cases registered, the figures for April are 507 and 132 respectively. In Sakhi one-stop centre, 60 cases of domestic violence were reported between March 24 and April 21. In the next eight days, it shot up by 37 cases taking the total figure to 97. The cases that came to women’s commission also shows that domestic violence has been on the rise during this period. Of the 321 cases that came before the commission in April, 57 were domestic violence cases. According to Biju Prabhakar, secretary of social justice and women and child development, the main reason for such an increase, mostly in rural pockets, is the improper functioning of the 129 women service centres and district women protection offices that offer psycho-social counselling, legal advice, during the lockdown. However, a detailed study from the Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA) suggests there are other reasons too. KILA analysed complaints received from March 23 to April 18 and has found financial insecurity during the lockdown to be a reason. Based on 'field-level verification', the study also states that several cases were not reported to helpline numbers. The KILA study says due to curbs on movement during the lockdown, women who faced such violence could not take shelter elsewhere. Also, as they were constantly monitored at home, they could not call the helpline. A dip in cases registered under section 498A IPC for cruelty by husband or relatives substantiate these findings. Only 17 such cases were registered between March 24 and April 14. It was 155 during the same period last year. "

",Tamil Nadu to check on victims of domestic violence,"CHENNAI: The state commission for women has directed the social welfare department to keep tabs during the lockdown on women in the city who had earlier complained about domestic violence. The commission and social workers are on alert as the exclusive helpline for women, 181, has received only four calls in the last 12 days from women in the city, when it normally gets 15-20 calls a day. The commission has asked the department to ensure that social workers provide shelter, medical aid or counselling to victims of violence and also to ensure that all one-stop centres are well equipped to take care of those in need. “We don’t know how many women are comfortable seeking help since they are stuck with their families all day inside their homes and don’t know how to seek help during these times,” said Kannagi Packianathan, chairperson of the commission.  “We are now following up on women who had previously complained of abuse, just to ensure they are alright,” said a social welfare department source. Women’s organisations said they too have not received any complaints from women since the shutdown. “They usually come to us when their spouses or families are away from home or when they are alone. But now they are not,” said R Geeta, an adviser to the unorganised workers federation. “And this is also a time when lack of money or unemployment can create more tensions and conflicts in a household and usually it’s the woman who bears the brunt,” said Geeta. Top Commentif domestic violence has reduced that is because TASMAC is closed.KSee All CommentsAdd comment“Or maybe women are not seeking help because they are happy that their spouses are standing by them during these turbulent times. This is another possibility,” said Sujata Mody, president of Penn Thozhilalargal Sangam. She too did not receive any complaint but pointed to cases where women said that their spouses were now sober and more responsible at home. “Low reporting does not necessarily indicate more violence. It’s high time that we stop thinking that only men from the working-class are capable of inflicting violence on their women,” she said. "

",Kerala: Counsellors witness spike in domestic violence cases,"KOCHI: Around 5,000 persons were given counselling by staff of district mental health programme since Covid-19 cases started to report from the state. In the beginning, counselling was limited to those under quarantine. Now, authorities plan to give counselling to many groups, including guest workers, as well. As part of the move, authorities are recruiting those who are fluent in Hindi. The number of cases handled by the staff of district mental health programme was just two or three in the initial days of February. Now, the number has increased to around 700 per day. At least two cases of domestic violence are reported every day at the control centre run by district mental health programme staff. ""Domestic abuse cases are mainly induced by alcohol. So, we have to treat the alcoholic and also sort out the domestic abuse issues,"" said district mental health programme (Ernakulam) nodal officer Dr Soumya Raj. ""Cases of those with withdrawal symptoms also are reported on a daily basis. Many such persons are approaching nearest public health centres and they are given drugs from there. In certain cases, it will require consultation of psychiatrist. Some of them will have to be admitted with Vimukthi centres, which are deaddiction centres run by us. There are around 20 persons admitted with these centres with alcoholism,"" she said. There are counsellors to take care of the cases of children with special needs and those who are already under psychiatric treatment. ""The children with special needs are being taken care of by those who have experience in handling such cases. Now, there is telemedicine facilities.

","Delhi: Now, visit Mother Dairy booth to report domestic abuse","NEW DELHI: Mother Dairy outlets and chemist shops, which have remained open throughout the Covid-19 lockdown in the capital, are now also serving as centres for women to silently report domestic abuse. With the domestic abuse cases in Delhi nearing 100 during the lockdown, Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) has chosen these places among others to spread awareness about its helpline number and also to allow a victim of domestic violence to pass on the information discreetly. National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) had recently come out with a report which revealed that Delhi had the third highest number of domestic violence cases in the country till mid-May. “In the pre-lockdown period, the victims would come to us to report. But now, we are trying to reach out to them at their doorstep. Once we receive a complaint or a call on our helpline number, our counsellors speak to both the victim and the abuser. But if the abuser is not willing to speak or is evasive, we depute a lawyer who files a petition in court on behalf of the victim,” said DSLSA member secretary Kanwal Jeet Arora. According to DSLSA, Mother Dairy booths and chemist shops are present in every locality of the city. Women frequent milk booths and pharmacy shops which have remained functional during the lockdown and hence these were chosen as centres to report domestic abuse. A similar tie-up with anganwadi and ASHA workers to report local domestic violence cases has yielded positive results. DSLSA chairperson Justice Hima Kohli last week made the reporting mechanism more robust by starting a mobile application that is available for download on android platform. Termed ‘Vidhik Sewa,’ the app intends to provide free legal aid to domestic violence victims among others. “Once the app is downloaded, the woman can register her details and write to us about the alleged abuse or violence. We will reach out to her through telecounselling,” Arora told TOI. Last month, the authority had informed the high court that it had started a toll-free helpline number 1516 with a view to help vulnerable sections of society and another WhatsApp number 9667992802 wherein any victim of domestic violence could approach it through SMS or by just giving a missed call. The victim would be contacted and provided legal aid and advice. "

",Least Covid affected state reports highest domestic violence and eviction cases,"NEW DELHI: Defying lockdown logic, least Covid affected state of Uttarakhand reported highest number of domestic violence cases while worst affected Maharashtra was among the states which reported lowest incidents of domestic violence. Uttarakhand with just 88 Covid positive cases topped the list accounting for 144 of 727 cases of domestic violence reported during the pandemic caused lockdown, as per the statistics compiled by National Legal Services Authority (NALSA). In contrast, Maharashtra with one 30k Covid positive cases, reported just 12 instances of domestic violence. NALSA chairman Justice N V Ramana held extensive meetings with heads of State Legal Services Authorities and had asked them to provide urgent legal help for relief to harassed women, evicted tenants in violation of the government directive and ensuring release of inmates of crowded prisons to decongest and prevent spread of the virus. Justice Ramana, the senior-most judge in Supreme Court, said, ""Legal Services Authorities through the Para Legal Volunteers are also bridging the gap between the needy and the government authorities, NGOs. They are connecting the people in need of food, medicines, shelter, etc. and migrant workers stranded in other places with the relevant Government authorities. In this connection, more than 90 lakh people have been assisted with their needs thus, successfully redressing their woes caused by the pandemic."" Compiling data provided by state legal services authorities, NALSA said, ""a total of 727 domestic violence cases were reported to Legal Services Authorities in different states/UTs where legal aid and assistance was sought. The cases reported in various states were: Uttarakhand 144, Haryana 79, Delhi 63, Chandigarh 50, Tamil Nadu 48, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh - 47 each, West Bengal 46, Odisha 37, Chhattisgarh 31, Bihar 21, Kerala 18, Jammu and Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram - 17 each, Maharashtra 12, Himachal Pradesh 10, Madhya Pradesh 8, Tripura 7, Rajasthan 4, Manipur 3 and Andhra Pradesh 1."" Legal assistance was provided in over 90% cases (658), it said. As a strange coincidence, it was Uttarakhand which reported highest number of cases relating to eviction of tenants by landlords despite a clear pan-India direction by the Union government that no tenant should be asked to vacate rented premises during the tough lockdown period. NALSA said country-wide it provided legal assistance to 310 tenants illegally attempted to be evicted by landlords.

The high court on December 18 last year had set aside six eviction decrees of trial courts against similarly placed women and said the women had a right to residence till their matrimonial ties subsisted. Appearing for an elderly parent-in-law, affected by the December 18 order, advocate Prabhjit Jauhar told a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and M R Shah that the HC exceeded the jurisdiction under the DV Act, which provided that a complaint could be made only against the husband and not against the in-laws. “Can the liability for alternative accommodation for estranged daughter-in-law be fastened on the in-laws’ self-acquired property?” he asked. The bench stayed the HC order and issued notice to the respondent daughter-in-law. Jauhar asked, “Can it be said that merely by residing for some period in the self-acquired and absolute property of the in-laws, the daughter-in-law acquires a statutory right to reside in the same and can the in-laws be fastened with a liability to provide alternative residence to the daughter-in-law?” "

Sonia and her two-year-old son Krishna had spent two nights on the road trying to reach Delhi from her husband’s home near Mathura in Uttar Pradesh. Unlike the thousands of migrant workers on the march, it was not hunger that forced Sonia to hit the road, but domestic violence. “My husband who has a small shop used to get drunk and then beat me every night. He would beat me with anything he could lay his hands on,” she said. “In the wee hours of Thursday, I ran out of patience and left my husband’s home with my son and started walking towards the highway,” said Sonia. Fortunately, an ambulance destined for Delhi, which also had a woman doctor in it, spotted her on the highway. “The doctor said she could drop me till Delhi’s Anand Vihar area, from where I could get a bus or train to Jharkhand. She also gave me some money,” Sonia said. Sonia met another good Samaritan at the railway station – social worker Shahin Hussain (35). “I saw Sonia and her son while distributing food to the migrants. After much struggle, I managed to find a place for them to take shelter. Officials at Yamuna Sports Complex in Vivek Vihar agreed to accommodate her.

","Domestic violence on the rise in Kolkata, women fail to reach out for help","KOLKATA: A woman living in a high profile highrise off Ballygunge Phanri filed an FIR at Ballygunge police station on May 7, alleging torture and abuse by her husband. In another instance, a women’s rights organisation called the police and rescued a woman who was being physically abused by her husband and relocated her to a friend’s place. Yet another woman has been forced to continue living with her tormentor because she cannot return to her parents’ house in Delhi due to the lockdown. These three instances are among hundreds of complaints that women’s rights advocacy groups and police have received since the lockdown. According to Swayam, a women’s rights organization committed to ending violence against women and children, the number of complaints received over telephone has shot up by 60% since the lockdown. “As soon as the lockdown happened, the calls at our centres went up dramatically. We believe the number of women who are suffering are much higher because only a fraction of women who face domestic violence can actually reach out for help. Fewer still can do so during this unprecedented lockdown scenario when they don’t have any respite from the tormetor and at times no opportunity to even make a call in private,” said Swayam founder Anuradha Kapoor. Cases of domestic violence has always been an issue in India with over 8,000 women killed by family members annually. While they are classified as dowry deaths, there are more deaths that are classified as unnatural deaths. “Everyday domestic violence, both at parental home and marital home is a huge problem. Women are emotionally, sexually, physically and financially abused all year round. But this lockdown is the worst time they may have ever faced because they cannot get away from the abuse,” said Kakoli Bhattacharya, a women’s rights crusader. Volunteers manning the helplines said they have received calls from both married and unmarried women. While husbands and in-laws were the perpetrators in the case of the former, in the latter, there were reports of violence by brothers against sisters and fathers against daughters. “Women could earlier run away or spend some time away from the violence. But the lockdown has robbed them of the opportunity,” Bhattacharya said. NGO All India Council of Human Rights, Liberties and Social Justice had moved Delhi HC last month, claiming there were increasing number of domestic violence incidents since the lockdown. The court had thereafter directed the Centre to deliberate on measures to curb domestic violence during the lockdown. "

",Pune Zilla Parishad to quarantine hubbies for domestic violence,"PUNE: Hubbies beware! Anybody found indulging in domestic violence would be sent to institutional quarantine. The Pune Zilla Parishad would send men to institutional quarantine for domestic violence if they do not mend their ways even after counselling. The decision was taken in view of rising complaints of domestic violence from the rural parts of the district during the lockdown. “We have come up with this order after consulting the Pune rural police. This step is required to curb complaints of domestic violence,” Ayush Prasad, the chief executive officer of Zilla Parishad (ZP), said. He said, “We have set up a women’s vigilance team comprising women members of the gram panchayat, self-help groups, Anganwadi helpers and workers, among others to keep a watch on these complaints. The committee will counsel men against whom complaints of domestic violence are made. If they do not mend their ways even after that, they will be put under institutional quarantine with the help of local police station in-charge,” said. According to the order of the ZP, the vigilance committee would be headed by the seniormost member of the gram panchayat. The committee is also supposed to take care of pregnant and lactating women, and children till the age of six. “We have also told the team members to focus on malnourished children and provide uninterrupted supply of essential goods to the villages,” Prasad said. Sandeep Patil, superintendent of police, Pune rural, said the ZP and the police were working in tandem. “We haven’t recorded a staggering increase in domestic violence cases, but we are getting four to five cases in a week. This kind of action is needed to send a stern message to the society,” he said. Vaishali Ranade, senior marriage counsellor of the special cell for women and children, Pune rural, said, “We have been getting at least eight to 10 calls related to domestic violence daily. These complaints are from all sections of the society. Some of the issues have emerged because of the lockdown, too. Since there is financial instability in the lower income class of the society, the men have become frustrated and they are venting out the frustration on their wives. So, some deterrence and out-of-the-box solution is required at the moment to address the problem.” "

",Karnataka high court quashes woman's domestic violence complaint against mother and brother,"BENGALURU: The high court has quashed a lower court's proceedings in a case registered against an elderly woman and her son by her daughter.  The daughter, Dr Ayesha, converted to Islam in 2002 and currently resides with her husband Dr Zubair Khan in Dubai. In 2018, she reportedly filed a complaint under the provisions of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, after her parents and brother refused to give into her demands over a property in Seshadripuram. After both 4th Metropolitan Magistrate Court and 60th City Civil and Sessions Court refused to quash Ayesha's complaint, NS Leelavathi and her son R Shiva Prathap moved the high court. The petitioners claimed Ayesha didn't share any kind of domestic relationship with them as she was residing with her husband. They also claimed that Ayesha was a permanent resident of Dubai and the very complaint under domestic violence (DV) act is an abuse of the process of law. When Ayesha came to India in October 2018, she demanded the property at Sheshadripuram, which was gifted to Shiva Prathap by Savithramma, Leelavathi's grandmother, be given to her, the petitioners said. When they refused to give in to her demands, she physically assaulted them. A case and a counter-case were registered after the incident. Soon after, Ayesha registered a complaint under the DV Act, they added. Agreeing with their contentions, Justice BA Patil said when a family member leaves the shared household to establish her own household, she cannot claim to have a right to move an application under section 12 of DV Act. The judge further noted that the property in question is absolute and exclusive property of Savithramma and the same was gifted to Shiva Prathap by a registered gift deed. It is neither a joint family property, nor does it belong to Savithramma's husband.  The judge, however, observed that if Ayesha wants to exercise her right over the property, she may file a suit for partition. "

",CP warns of strict action against domestic violence,"NASHIK: Commissioner of Police Vishwas Nangare-Patil has uploaded a video on social media warning Nashik residents of strict action if they are found indulging in domestic violence. In the 4.30 minute-long video, the city police have delineated how the lockdown is increasing frustration among people at the domestic level while women and children are finding themselves at the receiving end. Addressing citizens of the city, Nangare-Patil explained that the lockdown has now been a month old and it may continue even in the future, following which everyone will have to still stay indoors to stay safe from Covid-19. In the video, he said that if everyone observes patience, we all can come out of this problem soon. “While the lockdown is essential to prevent the spread of Covid-19, this lockdown is also getting on the nerves of many people, following which they are heated arguments among family members which, at times, also lead to physical assaults. Women, children and elders are facing maximum problems. However, such offences fall under domestic violence category and there is a provision of strict punishment to people who indulge in domestic violence,” he said. Nangare-Patil has appealed to the women to contact police immediately if they are facing harassment at domestic level. While cases of domestic violence are registered regularly, women may not be able to step out during lockdown to lodge complaint against their family members. However, the CP has asked women to immediately contact police if they need help. On Saturday, a 30-year-old woman from the Indiranagar area was seen waiting outside the Nashik Road railway station to take a train for Madhya Pradesh. She also had two children with her below five years of age. When asked, the woman said that she had left her husband’s house as she was being harassed. She said that her husband sold household articles to buy liquor on Friday and later beat her up. He also drove her out of the house. She said that she has also lodged a complaint against him with the Indiranagar police station. Since she could not take any more harassment, she decided to call it quits and leave Nashik by whatever means possible. "

",Counsellors busy resolving domestic violence cases in Trichy,"TRICHY: While the state government grapples with increasing cases of Covid-19, counsellors at government and non-government organisations (NGOs) have been coming across complaints of domestic violence over financial and other issues during the lockdown. Earlier, Trichy range police had launched a programme to check on 14,930 victims of domestic violence in the past four years in Trichy rural, Karur, Pudkukottai, Ariyalur and Perambalur following news of women suffering harassment during the lockdown. The district social welfare offices (DSWO) across the state have also offered to help such victims if any. In Trichy, the efforts of DSWO started yielding result in the first week itself with five women complaining against their husbands. While three of them concerned financials issues, the other two were related to illicit affairs. Enquiries revealed that the loss of income of the male head of the family had triggered such issues. Despite dip in the income under lockdown, the expenditure on essential things could not be avoided. “When money becomes the cause of concern, some men force their wives to get financial help from their parents. If the women confront their husbands, it will turn into domestic violence,” said Trichy DSWO A Thamimmunisha. The protection officer, family welfare counsellor and other staff attached to DSWO would attend to the complaints either by providing counselling over phone or visiting them. The officials claimed that their intervention helped the couple sort out the issues between them. A family counsellor, T Rosy, attached to Kajamalai Ladies Association, visited some houses in the district to settle the dispute over a trivial issue between a couple. “Besides issues over financial problems, people are getting angry over petty issues like use of TV remote control, watching a favourite channel and handling children. We intervene and provide counselling to them,” said Rosy. On illicit affairs, the officials said that either the husband or wife was exposed to their partners while flirting over the phone at home during the lockdown. Some of the women embroiled in the issue even decided to leave their family and stay in the working women hostel run by the social welfare department.

","In isolation, crime rates dip but domestic violence rises","Vijayawada: It has been just over a month since the Prime Minister declared a lockdown across the nation. Krishna district has witnessed a drastic decrease in crime rate in the last 29 days. According to District Crime Records Bureau (DCRB) data, major crimes in April is 71% lesser than in March. Not surprisingly, the district witnessed an 88% decrease in road accidents and a 72% decrease in fatalities associated with it. With barely any traffic on the highways, the police point out that the number of mishaps this month could be among the lowest in history. However, women harassment cases and domestic violence cases continue to stand as the second most frequently-occurring crimes in the district. The graver crimes against woman such as rape and crimes that fall under POCSO, saw more than a 50% decrease in the current month. Naturally, cases of the lockdown being violated are the biggest crime with 1,809 cases registered during April alone. Experts suggest that the decrease in crime rate could also be attributed to the fact that people are reluctant to commit offences due to the certainty in which they could get caught during the lockdown. Nevertheless, some desperate thefts were committed by alcoholics who tried to steal from local liquor stores in the district. Overall, the first 20 days of April saw only 15 theft cases while the whole month of March saw 30. Speaking to TOI, Krishna district SP M Ravindranath Babu explained that the decreasing trend began during March itself prior to the lockdown. “The more common crimes like theft, robberies and other property offences saw a huge decrease due to the lack of business activity in the district. This trend may not continue after the lockdown, but it surely gives a clear indication as to what can deter it,” Babu told TOI. Officials said that since restrictions are in place across district borders, it is practically impossible for anyone to give a slip and escape somewhere outside the state. "

",Mumbai women facing domestic violence email for help,"MUMBAI: More women in the city are using email over phone calls to communicate their distress due to domestic violence (DV), show case files piling up with NGOs. Women are finding it difficult to call NGOs, especially because an abusive family member is at home, sharing the same confines. A voluntary organization working with women has witnessed an almost four-fold rise in “crisis emails” from women in the past month. Another, which works for the homeless, saw a spike in complaints via direct text messages or tagged posts on social media, and not conventionally through phone calls. “Texting or emailing which is discreet, is the way out, said Ankita Kohirkar, project coordinator at URJA. She said the NGO has received 10 texts since March 15 and nine calls. Before the lockdown, texts were almost negligible and referrals were on phone or police helplines for URJA. “The change in the mode of complaints also reflects a change in the demographics of DV survivors,” said Nayreen Daruwala, director at SNEHA. “During the lockdown, women are finding it easier to seek help through email or texting. On an average, our counselling centres receive 10 crisis emails and 100 calls on helpline numbers monthly. But the trend has changed during the Covid-19 lockdown. From March 15 to April 15, we received 49 crisis mails (33 emails from Mumbai and 16 from different parts of India) where survivors wrote to us for help but prevented us from making phone calls to them. The number of helpline calls reduced to 69 in this period.” URJA, which works for the homeless, saw a spike in direct text messages on WhatsApp or tagged posts on its social media platform, and not conventionally through phone calls. “Women from marginalized sections prefer to call or meet local counsellor-volunteers. Some community volunteers are still out and registered 187 DV complaints in the lockdown,” said Daruwala. The rise in emails, she said, reflects that while such abuse spawns across societal strata, the middle or upper middle class and the educated survivors are now reaching out more against either fresh outbreak of violence or old abuse that the lockdown has exacerbated. In one case, a Powai building resident facing violence at home emailed her plight. The police, when contacted by an NGO, said they were busy minding lockdown violators, but when persuaded by SNEHA counsellors, relented to mediate in the case. The Powai woman is now safe with a relative. Not just wives, daughters too are at receiving end of abuse, physical and mental or emotional, but daughters too, especially those who want to pursue education. A 21-year old, second year BA student from a Bandra-Khar area, on Thursday wrote to say her father was constantly abusing her and asking her to leave home or go to the village where her four other siblings were. Another, a 34-year-old with an infant and five-year-old texted that her husband wanted them out and was harassing them daily during the lockdown. In an email from a high-rise township, a teen wrote of her father “punching’’ her “in the face’’ and beating and twisting her fingers and even breaking her nails. She wanted to leave home. Another teen said she saw her mother suffer her father’s beatings and he was not giving them money to even buy groceries. The problem with courts being practically at a standstill was an added problem, said activists. Protection officers do work.There are only 35 for Mumbai and Thane. Former chairperson of Maharashtra Women’s Commission,Susieben Shah, said “counselling centres were established in every district and the state should ensure they are made active now during the lockdown buy having e-counselling available.” “I urge governments to put women and girls at the centre oftheir efforts to recover from Covid-19,’’ said United Nations Secretary General Antonio Gutteres ten days ago alarmed at the “horrifying global surge in domestic violence against women and girls’’ during the lockdown. In Mumbai, meanwhile, advocates have started showing theirconcern with lockdown phase 2 having begun are eager to help. Advocates Anita Castellino and Saloni Ghule on behalf of group of lawyers largely practicing at Bombay high court wrote to union law minister for women and child development, Smriti Irani to offer their services towards legal aid for victims of domestic violence given its rise during the lockdown. In another letter, advocate Sejal Pawar suggested the development and use of ‘silent solution system’ based on the one in the United Kingdom to help children who cannot speak up. “The child just has to dial a dedicated number and keep phone on, the domestic abuse would get recorded,’’ she said. Different factors have led to the increase in domestic violence across the city. “Factors that contribute, we found, include withdrawal symptoms of addicted family members and stress and frustration of losing income,’’ said Kohirkar. For many, the lockdown, said activists, has still not led to shared domestic chores, but instead heightened a woman’s role as a mother, wife, daughter, a care-giver with no outlet against barbs or brute violence.

They were admitted to Kasturba hospital, while four staff from the centre have been quarantined. The woman in her 40s was referred to the centre after she came to hospital seeking psychiatric help around 10 days back. She confided in counsellors about ill-treatment of her and the daughters aged five and 15. But she wanted to be reunited with family and tried returning home, only to be turned away again. That’s when One-stop volunteers started looking for alternative accommodation. Dr Nayreen Daruwalla of Sneha NGO, instrumental in starting the centre, said Manav Seva Sangh in Matunga, which runs an orphanage and shelter for women, agreed to accommodate her. “But as she would be taking care of children at the orphanage, they said she should be tested for Covid-19,” Daruwalla said, adding that the institute promised to accept her once she recovers. After their reports came two days back, the centre got three counsellors and a nurse tested as they had interacted with and counselled the woman. They were awaiting test reports on Wednesday. The woman and daughters are asymptomatic. Dr Daruwalla said even if the staff test positive, they would try to keep the centre functional by mobilising counsellors from other centres. “Such a centre comes under essential services.

Naveen asked the director general of police Abhay to punish the habitual offenders of domestic violence. “DGP should keep an eye on domestic violence. You (DGP) know who the habitual offenders are. Strict action should be taken,” Naveen said in a video message after reviewing the state’s Covid-19 management with senior officials through a video conference from his home Naveen Niwas. Soon after Naveen’s directive, the state police headquarters drew the plan of action and issued a circular to the commissionerate police and superintendents of police (SPs) in districts for strict enforcement. “During the lockdown period many countries/states have seen rise in domestic violence. Possibility of same occurring in Odisha cannot be ruled out. In compliance to instructions of the chief minister, we have issued directions to police stations,” DGP Abhay said. According to the circular, domestic violence cases should be given high priority. Though, there is no noticeable increase in reporting of such cases so far, police stations have been asked to remain alert. The circular said victims of domestic violence need not visit police stations to lodge complaints. “On receipt of complaint over telephone, the police will reach the spot/home to collect complaints/FIR and take necessary action. Victims can also approach police through Odisha Police citizen portal and Sahayata mobile App,” the circular said. State police headquarters asked SPs to widely publicize helpline numbers of police stations and police control room numbers for the convenience of women facing domestic abuse. “We have already strengthened our telephonic grievance mechanism in view of the lockdown and people’s inconvenience in making movements outside. Over 600 phones lines are active in police stations across the state. Women in distress can use the telephone helplines,” the circular said. All cases of the domestic violence during lockdown period should be investigated by officer not below the rank of sub-inspector. “Such cases should be supervised by an officer of DSP rank or above. The investigation unit for crime against women (IUCAW) of the districts should remain more alert during the lockdown period,” the circular said. "

The commissionerate police are planning to receive complaints from, and deliver FIR copies to, women’s homes. Though the city police have not yet compiled any data on whether cases related to domestic violence are on the rise, they said they are prepared to deal with such cases, if reported. “We realise that women in distress are unable to visit police stations during the lockdown. After receiving their complaints over telephone, our personnel will visit their houses and extend help. We will ensure that proper social distancing protocol is maintained by our personnel during counselling and interaction with the complainants in their houses. The women facing domestic violence will receive all police-related services on their doorstep,” additional commissioner of police Anup Kumar Sahoo said. Some states have reportedly witnessed a rise in domestic violence cases during the lockdown. The National Commission for Women (NCW) recently spoke to all state commissions and asked them to address the issues of the needy women. The state commission for women (SCW) said it is planning to issue a helpline number to address issues relating to atrocities against women during the lockdown. At present, the SCW office is closed as it is located in Satya Nagar that was declared a containment zone following detection of four positive cases recently. “We are only receiving complaints through email (oscw.od@nic.in). Since not many are conversant with technology, we are receiving fewer complaints through email. Efforts are on to launch a helpline number. After receiving complaints through email, we coordinate with police across the state for giving justice to the women. Our counsellors have been providing tele-counselling to the women in distress,” said Arabinda Pattanaik, SCW’s legal assistant. While the SCW used to receive at least 30 complaints related to domestic violence daily before the lockdown, they have received only two cases in the past 20 days. “We are also in touch with government’s Sakhi or One Stop Help Centres for women in districts. Women in distress can also seek help from the government’s 181 helpline number,” Pattanaik said. "

She cannot, said the Gujarat high court on the ground that the woman cannot be termed as an aggrieved person under the concerned act in such a case. In an important judgment, Justice Umesh Trivedi said, ""Once the marital tie is severed by way of divorce between the parties the relationship between them is snapped... the wife would be aggrieved person so long as domestic relationship survives. As soon as it is snapped, it is an end to the domestic relationship and she would not be aggrieved person then."" The court further said, ""After divorce between two persons, neither the domestic relationship survives nor any person would be termed as an aggrieved person for the purpose of this (DV) Act. Hence, after divorce takes place between husband and wife, the provisions under the Act cannot be invoked."" The case is from Surendranagar town. Kanji Parmar and Urmila had wed in 1984. Parmar filed for divorce in 1989. The couple settled their dispute and formally divorced in 1990. Later, Urmila wed one Premji Tundiya. Twenty-seven years later, Urmila slapped two cases on Parmar when he was on the verge of retirement from BSNL. Parmar's advocate Ashvin Gateshaniya said that the woman sought maintenance from Parmar with an eye on his retirement benefits. She filed for maintenance in Surendranagar family court under Section 125 of CrPC as well as under the DV act by claiming herself to be an aggrieved person due to the domestic relationship that once existed. The family court rejected Urmila's application for maintenance after Parmar showed proof of her second marriage. However, a magisterial court took cognizance of her complaint under the DV act and started proceedings after accepting her claim to be an aggrieved person in a domestic relationship. After hearing the case, the HC said, ""There is irresistible conclusion that divorced wife who has remarried cannot invoke provisions of ""the Act"" against her erstwhile husband."" "

","Govt sets fare range for flights, 40% tickets to be sold below mid-point","NEW DELHI: The government has fixed minimum and maximum fares, effective till 11.59pm on August 24, for domestic flights that will resume from Monday. Airlines will need to sell 40% seats below midpoint of the fare band on each flight. Based on flying time, there are seven categories: starting at flights below 40 minutes having a range of Rs 2,000-6,000 and going upto those with flying time of 3-3.5 hours with a range of Rs 6,500-18,600 (see graphic). With air services set to resume from May 25, most airlines have started taking bookings. Aviation minister H S Puri said there may not be any requirement to quarantine domestic passengers. “The rules of different states will need to be followed. It does not seem domestic flyers will need to be quarantined,” Puri said. The new protocol for flying has also been finalised that, among other things, prohibits eating on board (except on health ground), advises pregnant women, aged and people with health issues not to fly for now and check-in bag tags that passengers used to get being replaced by SMSs. People staying in containment zones and those who have been detected corona positive in the last two months can’t fly. And if they do so, penal action will be taken against them. Meanwhile, the economy one-way fares fixed by the government, that do not include user development fee of airports, passenger security fees (Rs 150 for domestic) and GST, will be in force till 11.59 pm of August 24, 2020. Delhi-Mumbai, one of the world’s busiest domestic air routes, falls in a category with fare range of Rs 3,500-10,000. Airlines will need to sell 40% seats at below the mid point of Rs 6,750. This sector had about 100 daily flights and now having about 33 could have meant sky-high fares — with a sneak peak being provided by a low-cost airline, which opened bookings for some time on Wednesday night. Delhi-Mumbai one-way was going for over Rs 17,000. “It is important to open up (the skies) now… to strike a balance between life and livelihood. So we are beginning with about one-third (of approved DGCA summer schedule) domestic flights in a calibrated manner. Based on the experience, we will increase domestic flights,” aviation minister H S Puri said. In Video:Govt sets airfare range for flights, 40% tickets to be sold below mid-point"

","Crime rate drops, domestic violence spikes as Bhopal stays indoors","BHOPAL: The lockdown in the wake of Covid-19 has put habitual offenders and criminals out of action, say Bhopal police, citing data that shows a dip in the most categories. Take for example, crime against women. As per police data, there has been an 85% decline in cases of crime against women — rape, abduction and molestation — during lockdown as compared to that during previous months, and previous year. Other serious offences like attempt to murder, loot, theft, vehicle theft have also declined by over 50%. Police said, theft cases have seen the most drastic drop. The number of thefts reported declined by 90% in April 2020 as compared to April 2019. Strict enforcement of lockdown and constant monitoring of movement has led to a reduction in crimes, said police. Senior police officials, on the condition of anonymity, however said, although there has been a decline in serious offence with everyone confined indoors, but it is also important to note that there are a few cases whicsh were not reported as the victims were not able to reach the police station to file a complaint. The side-effect of staying indoors was that there was an increase in the number of cases reported for domestic violence, assault, dispute among neighbours Psychiatrists and social activists believe that many of these cases are a result of withdrawal symptoms of those addicted to alcohol and other psychotropic substances. In addition, the city also saw rise in supply of illegal liquor. On an average around a dozen cases were registered against bootleggers daily. Even cases of online fraud and online sexual harassment are also on the rise, but cyber cops say they are not being reported as much Cyber cops said, police have been releasing advisories to make residents aware of online fraud and how to keep themselves safe. DIG Irshad Wali said, “Crime rate has gone down as people are staying at home ... People are not moving out, so vehicle thefts are not taking place. All these things are correlated. Strict enforcement of lockdown by police and constant monitoring has resulted in decline in crime rate.” Data decoded: As per police data, seven rape cases reported in the city in April while 14 cases were reported in March. During the same period last year, one rape case and two molestation cases were reported in the city on an average daily. Despite the dip in crime against women, the rape of a blind bank official on April 17 sent chills across the city. Police took the case as a challenge and nabbed the accused after a week despite unfavourable conditions due to the spread of Covid-19 in the city. If we take a look at the data of burglary, theft and vehicle theft in lockdown. Only one case of loot was reported in April while in March two cases were reported. The murder of 65-year-old railway employee in Chhola remains unsolved. "

",UN warns of global mental health crisis due to Covid-19 pandemic,"LONDON: A mental illness crisis is looming as millions of people worldwide are surrounded by death and disease and forced into isolation, poverty and anxiety by the pandemic of Covid-19, United Nations health experts said on Thursday. ""The isolation, the fear, the uncertainty, the economic turmoil - they all cause or could cause psychological distress,"" said Devora Kestel, director of the World Health Organization's (WHO) mental health department. Presenting a UN report and policy guidance on Covid-19 and mental health, Kestel said an upsurge in the number and severity of mental illnesses is likely, and governments should put the issue ""front and centre"" of their responses. ""The mental health and well being of whole societies have been severely impacted by this crisis and are a priority to be addressed urgently,"" she told reporters at a briefing. The report highlighted several regions and sections of societies as vulnerable to mental distress - including children and young people isolated from friends and school, healthcare workers who are seeing thousands of patients infected with and dying from the new coronavirus. Emerging studies and surveys are already showing Covid-19's impact on mental health globally. Psychologists say children are anxious and increases in cases of depression and anxiety have been recorded in several countries. Domestic violence is rising, and health workers are reporting an increased need for psychological support. Reuters last week reported from interviews with doctors and nurses in the United States who said either they or their colleagues had experienced a combination of panic, anxiety, grief, numbness, irritability, insomnia and nightmares. Outside of the health sector, the WHO report said many people are distressed by the immediate health impacts and the consequences of physical isolation, while many others are afraid of infection, dying, and losing family members. Millions of people are facing economic turmoil, having lost or being at risk of losing their income and livelihoods, it added. And frequent misinformation and rumours about the pandemic and deep uncertainty about how long it will last are making people feel anxious and hopeless about the future. It outlined action points for policy-makers to aim ""to reduce immense suffering among hundreds of millions of people and mitigate long-term social and economic costs to society"". These included redressing historic under-investment in psychological services, providing ""emergency mental health"" via remote therapies such as tele-counselling for frontline health workers, and working proactively with people known to have depression and anxiety, and with those at high risk of domestic violence and acute impoverishment.

",Domestic violence victims struggle to contact officials,"HYDERABAD: While the National Commission for Women (NCW) has tried to reassure women facing domestic violence that all is not lost, experts and women’s groups said such women are finding it difficult to get help amidst lockdown. NCW even posted its chairperson and members’ email addresses urging women to reach out for help. In a bid to highlight the aggrieved women’s plight, NCW recently made a post on its Facebook page saying, “Women are facing the brunt of this upheaval in the wake of #COVID19outbreak. There’s an increasing number of domestic violence complaint and worse it is difficult for women to access institutional support at times like these (sic).” However, experts said women facing domestic violence were at the receiving end and added that the possibility of all such cases being reported look bleak. Shaheen, a city-based NGO, said distress calls came down to five a day from 20 calls a day previously. “Recently, a woman called and said her husband drinks at home and beats her up. She can’t go out and seek help,” Jameela Nishat, founder-director of Shaheen, said. Nishat also explained that many women do not have access to phone or internet to seek help. Echoing similar feelings, Tripurana Venkataratnam, advisor in National Women’s Commission and former chairperson of State Women’s Commission, said domestic violence victims are more vulnerable during the lockdown period. TSWC officials said only a couple of women had called seeking help. “The women who faced abuse from in-laws and husbands are vulnerable and become an easy target during the lockdown,” said an official. Meanwhile, counsellors said domestic violence cases are mainly related to men’s alcohol addiction. With liquor shops closed during the lockdown, there is a good possibility that withdrawal symptoms could lead to a spurt in domestic violence. “SHE Teams and Bharosa Centre are functioning. Women should not try to suppress their agony if they undergo domestic violence at the hands of their husbands or in-laws. Even the society and neighbours should be vigilant,” said Kanika Durga, a former counsellor with Bharosa Centre, Hyderabad. "

",'Most domestic violence cases result of doubt over fidelity’,"HYDERABAD: A large number of domestic violence cases registered in the city are due to fidelity issues, say experts. In past two years, all three commissionerates registered over 3,000 domestic violence cases. The counsellors, working with police department, get at least 10 cases every month where either of the spouse file domestic violence cases after suspecting fidelity. Recently, a man was arrested for killing his wife as he suspected her of infidelity. There have been four incidents this year alone, where the man either injured or killed his wife after suspecting her fidelity. “Nearly 40% domestic violence cases are filed after either of the spouse suspects the other of having extramarital affair. We usually forward these cases to NGOs for counselling the couple,” said a SHE team source. Last year, over 900 domestic violence cases were recorded by Rachakonda commissionerate, of which about 150 cases were of violence faced by women as their husband suspected their fidelity. “Such cases need at least four months of counselling,” said K Sundeep, a counsellor.

The deceased, Vinu Parmar, was arrested following an application of complaint given by his wife Rama on Monday morning. Post-midnight, he went inside the toilet in the lock-up and hanged himself with the door stopper using a handkerchief. Cops got suspicious as he did not come out for nearly an hour. On breaking into the toilet, they found his body. Police said Parmar was also arrested on February 29 for molesting a nine-year-old girl in Bhimnagar locality where he lived. He was booked under sections of Pocso Act, but released on bail around 20 days ago. “Preliminary investigation has revealed that Parmar feared that his bail in Pocso case would also be cancelled after being arrested for domestic violence. This may have driven him to suicide,” said JV Dhola, police inspector, Taluka police station. "

",78% rise in crimes against women in Haryana during lockdown,"GURUGRAM: The number of crimes against women reported in the state during the lockdown has seen an increase of around 78% between March 22 and April 28, according to data collated by Haryana State Commission for women. Preeti Bhardwaj, vice-chairperson of the Haryana State Commission for Women (HSCW), said they have collated data from across the districts and it covers the complaints made on the women’s helpline number (1091), the women police stations and directly to HSCW. “In the past five weeks of the lockdown, the number of crimes against women have seen an increase by 78%. However, compared to the national average of 92% as tweeted by the national commission for women, Haryana still fares better,” said Bhardwaj. She added that they have also seen an increase in the usage of words ‘domestic violence’ in these calls. The Gurgaon Police had shared that during the lockdown till April 15, quite a few complaints of domestic violence were reported on the women’s helpline number, and in some of the severe cases medical intervention had to be sought. Complaints are also mailed to or simply thrown inside the premises of the HSCW office which is shut as the officials are working from home, and so, this data might not be exhaustive, Bharadwaj explained. “Many complaints are not reaching us as we are working remotely. And in some cases, the data shared by some district police is not accurate. Hence we are not able to disclose district-wise data.” Talking about Gurgaon in particular, she said, “We were actually surprised with the numbers in Gurgaon as the city fared much better than the rest of the state in terms of the number of complaints against women,” said Bhardwaj. Gurgaon also has the highest resolution rate for such complaints, she shared. Because some women might not be able to send in their complaints by post or reach the nearest police station due to the lockdown, the commission also launched a WhatsApp number 9560080115 named “Ayog Sakhi” where women can write to them. This is in line with National Commission for Women advisory. This number will be operational only for the period of lockdown and/or till all restrictions are lifted by the state government, and till HSCW staff resumes office. This number has been launched in addition to the existing helpline numbers. "

","Right to mental peace for all; marriage entitles husband, wife to equal respect: Delhi HC","NEW DELHI: Every human being has a right to mental peace and happiness and marriage, which is a sacrament, cannot be a one-sided affair and both partners are entitled to equal respect and responsibilities, the Delhi high court has observed while dissolving a couple's marriage on the grounds of cruelty and desertion by the husband. The high court's observation came while dismissing the husband's appeal challenging a family court's decision to dissolve his marriage on the grounds of inflicting cruelty on his wife and deserting her. A bench of justices Hima Kohli and Asha Menon, in its judgement, said the continuous badgering of the wife by a very insensitive and selfish husband is clear as daylight from the testimony of the daughter and nothing more needs to be said. The court said this is a typical case that showcases as to what would amount to cruel behaviour on the part of one spouse to the utter detriment of the other. ""Every human being has a right to mental peace, happiness and contentment. Marriage is no doubt a sacrament, but it cannot be a one-sided affair. Both parties to the marriage are equal partners and entitled to mutual respect, sharing of duties and responsibilities, affection, emotional bonding, financial and all other support for the well-being of one another. ""If the relationship is so bitter and lopsided that the welfare and well-being of one is at the immense cost and well-being of the other, there can be no sacrament such as that the appellant (man) now harps about,"" the bench said. Initially, the woman, who got married to the man in 1992, approached the family court seeking dissolution of the marriage on the grounds of cruelty and desertion by her husband. The plea was allowed by the family court in November 2019. The man challenged the family court's decision in the high court, saying the woman could not get the benefit of her own wrong as she had left his company without any reason and claimed that the main reason for the differences between them was the disparity in their incomes and education, though she knew about his qualifications at the time of marriage. He claimed they lived a happy married life for 20 years and now, when their daughter had turned major and was of marriageable age, it was not in her interest that the divorce petition be allowed as it would destroy her life. The court, however, said the material on record demonstrates the sincere efforts made by the wife to salvage the marriage and shows that to preserve the relationship, she did more than what was her duty. The court said there was nothing to commend the man and it was to the credit of the woman that presently, their daughter is pursuing a PhD in the UK and got her master's degree from Switzerland. It noted that under the domestic violence law, the daughter had sought her father's 50 per cent contribution towards the expenses of her master's programme and job, but he even contested that in court and waited for the court's direction to pay some amount. ""She (daughter) is doing extremely well in her academics, particularly after October 2011. It may not be incorrect to infer that had he not left the respondent (woman) in October 2011, it may have resulted in the down-spiralling of the future of the daughter, about whose welfare the appellant (man) is now showing such concern,"" the bench said while dismissing the man's appeal as being meritless.

Rajesh alias Tukaram Thakur’s wife Priti had registered a complaint on Monday after learning about her husband’s alleged extra-marital affair with a colleague and a son born out of the illicit relationship. Priti, who has been living with her mother at Gotri since October last year, told police that she left her husband when he threatened to kill her. Priti had confronted Thakur about the son born out of his relationship with his colleague Sarvada Chaudhary, after she found a birth certificate from the house. The birth certificate had Thakur’s name as father and Chaudhary’s name as mother. Priti’s complaint stated that in 2010 she had learnt about Thakur and Chaudhary’s extra marital affair. She had submitted a complaint to then Surat city police commissioner following which Thakur and Chaudhary were posted in different police stations. Later the elders of the couple’s family met and a settlement was reached wherein Thakur promised that he will improve his behaviour and not indulge in extra-marital affair. The complaint also stated that a few months after reaching a settlement, Priti began living with Thakur, But was subjected to domestic violence. "

","Haryana: Drop in calls to women's helpline this year, 1,400 on domestic violence","GURGAON: Twenty-two women called the women helpline number (1091) every day in Gurgaon in the current year, as per data shared by Gurgaon Police. In all, 8,000 calls were received by the women helpline (till November in 2019) as compared to 8,500 calls in the year 2018. Of the total number of calls, the highest were complaints of domestic violence. The number of calls in relation to domestic violence was 1,400 in 2019 and 1,470 last year. Around 100 complaints were made against offenses such as stalking, eve-teasing and attempt to rape this year, compared to around 130 similar complaints in 2018. The police officials have claimed that around 6,500 complaints did not have 'specific allegations.' Talking about the numbers, ACP, Usha Kundu said that cases of domestic violence are reported from all sections of the society. ""In many cases, the complaints of domestic violence are from the highest section of the society and very upscale areas. A lot of them are reported during the evening hours when the men tend to drink and then have fights with their wives,"" said Kundu. Other officials concurred that in many cases, these cases are related to dowry or divorce. As far as the 'unspecific allegations' are concerned, Kundu said that sometimes women call for things like delay in their salaries or differences at work. No complaints are registered in such cases. However, these numbers do not fully depict the prevailing situation as many women have complained that they cannot reach the helpline number in the time of need. TOI had earlier reported that the helpline number wasn't often reachable. In other cases, where the call does go through, the cops often are not sensitized enough to handle the situation says Prabhloch Singh who runs Human Rights Protection Group and MFP Protection. Singh says that he has worked with many women victims who were cross-questioned when they called the helpline for some help. ""These 6,500 calls that they are calling unspecific are the calls when a woman is being stared at outside a college or misbehaved with near a mall and instead of sending help, cops often start questioning the victim instead,"" said Singh.

","In COVID-19 lockdown, US reports surge in domestic violence","WASHINGTON DC: At a time when violent crimes, including murder, rape and assault, have plummeted owing some form of lockdown across the world to slow the spread of COVID-19, official figures cited by The Economist have shown a sharp rise in domestic violence--a crime committed in private, inside people's homes.  An analysis on Wednesday, by the London-based weekly magazine of data collected from five big American cities, indicates that although most types of crime have indeed fallen in recent weeks, reports of domestic violence have increased.  Sifting through over 100,000 reports from police departments in Chicago, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Memphis and New Orleans, which all went into lockdown from March 19 to 24, the tabloid learned that total crime soon fell by 25 per cent, compared with the week ending on March 1. However, reports of domestic violence increased by 5 per cent.  Domestic violence is thought to be one of the most under-reported crimes. During lockdown, it maybe even more so. Forced to stay with a violent family member or partner, it may be more difficult, if not dangerous, for victims to seek help when the abuser is always around.  Earlier this month, UN chief Antonio Guterres also called for measures to address a ""horrifying global surge in domestic violence"" directed towards women and girls, linked to lockdowns imposed by governments responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The combination of economic and social stresses brought on by the pandemic, as well as restrictions on movement, have dramatically increased the numbers of women and girls facing abuse, in almost all countries. However, even before the global spread of the new coronavirus, statistics showed that a third of women around the world experienced some form of violence in their lives, he stressed during a briefing.  Citing the records of other countries, The Economist further stated that reports of domestic violence have risen by 30 per cent in France.  However, the tabloid said further that some governments have also taken action to stop the abuse of women at homes.  In France, victims of domestic violence can visit newly created drop-in centres near supermarkets, or stay in a hotel room at the government's expense. In Spain, those who would like to report violence at home discreetly can visit a pharmacy and give the code word ""Mask 19"". The pharmacist will then alert the authorities, the tabloid reported.  Data provided by Denmark's national domestic-violence hotline, Lev Uden Vold (Life Without Violence), show that in the week after the country's lockdown began, total call volumes fell by more than 50 per cent, while calls about emergency shelters--typically from people asking for a place to stay immediately--rose sharply.  In Denmark, the authorities have set up additional temporary shelters to deal with the surge in requests.  Globally, more than 2.5 million people have been diagnosed with the deadly virus, with a tally of 170,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The stringent lockdown measures in place have further led civilian lives only restricted to their homes in a bid to contain the virus spread which further has been affecting the mental status of the people and leading to a surge in cases of violence at homes.

",Chennai: Women endure abuse in silence,"CHENNAI: Since the lockdown, the number of distress calls that The International Foundation for Crime Prevention and Victim Care (PCVC) has been receiving from survivors of domestic violence has almost tripled. From three such calls a week, the number of calls has now jumped to nine. Reporting violence at the hands of a partner or family member in itself is an act of courage, but for several such women, the effort turns futile with almost no alternative and safe spaces to go to, should they decide to leave home at all. With shelters functioning at half their strength to meet social distancing norms, the strict protocols for medical clearance before getting rehabilitated and transport restrictions, women have no choice but to endure physical and psychological harm at home. “There are those who text us late at night seeking help, but decide to stay on (at home), because leaving would mean taking the kids along, and without safe, sanitary and guaranteed alternatives, they risk infection,” says Prasanna Gettu, founder of PCVC. “We too cannot risk crowding our shelters at this time, so the best we have been able to do is open up two rooms in our office space to accommodate anyone who needs urgent rehabilitation,” she says. PCVC is also exploring joining hands with some hotels in the city to see if they can accommodate women fleeing physical and sexual violence. Home isolation for weeks on end has forced families into scenarios where abuse typically thrives – constant surveillance by perpetrator to ensure the survivor doesn’t access help, alcoholic partners finding an easy target in women to take their frustration out on, work from home or no work days for women who stare at an uncertain job market post the lockdown, which essentially severs their scope for both physical distance from harm as well as economic independence. The police control is seeing a surge in domestic violence cases, receiving an average of 25 such calls a day. However, these haven’t translated into cases reaching the doors of government-run shelters. Since the lockdown, the state helpline for women, 181, has recorded a dip in the number of such calls it receives in a day. Officials from state-run homes such as the Christ Faith Home for Women and Children in Porur, and Manushya rehabilitation centre in Alapakkam, say no cases of domestic violence have been registered with them since March 25 when the lockdown began. Tamil Nadu State Commission for Women chairperson Kannagi Packianathan says in order to help as many women in distress, names and numbers of welfare counselors are being widely circulated, along with helpline numbers. “We offer online counseling and my number too is available to anyone seeking help. In some very severe cases that call for immediate evacuation, police help accommodate women at the One Stop Centre,” she says. However, the city’s single One Stop Centre in Tambaram is geographically cut off and mostly restricted to addressing cases through phone counselling due to lockdown. Among the few state-run shelters taking in women now is Madras Christian Council of Social Service (MCCSS). Executive secretary of MCCSS Isabel Richardson says they have received at least four women from lower socio-economic backgrounds fleeing domestic violence in the last few weeks. “Most are directed by police, Child Line or come by themselves,” she says. Social distancing however, remains a worry. There are those who text us late at night seeking help, but decide to stay on (at home), because leaving home would mean taking the kids along, and without safe and guaranteed alternatives, they risk infection "

However, 12 calls were family disputes. “These disputes were sorted out by our personnel who visited the homes concerned and held discussions,” said H Jayalakshmi, deputy commissioner of police. “The complainants didn’t want to take any action.

And a log should be maintained to ensure follow-up on the calls received. The nodal officers should ensure that police personnel visit the vulnerable households and localities every so often. Those with a history of violence against women and children should be monitored as reporting crimes inside homes will not be easy for the victims during the lockdown.

",Domestic violence calls to 181 helpline dip during lockdown,"Hubballi: The Mahila Sahayavani (181 helpline) in Karnataka has reported a decrease in calls related to domestic violence during the Covid-19 lockdown. The trend, however, does not necessarily mean a fall in such cases. Many instances might have gone unreported since victims are ever in the close proximity of abusers due to the lockdown. According to officials of the women and child development department, the 181 toll-free helpline received 86 calls pertaining to domestic violence between March 23 and April 13 (22 days). There were 200 calls received in the 22 days prior to March 23. Some experts said self-isolating partners at home due to the lockdown led to decrease in abusive behaviour and violence against women. The male member generally abuses his wife in a drunken state, but such cases dropped due to the non-availability of liquor. However, Suvarna A T, supervisor of Mahila Sahayavani, said women might not get a free hand to call the helpline when the abuser is present at home. “Even during normal days, we receive complaint calls on behalf of the women in trouble. But due to the lockdown, women may have to restrict themselves at home. She may not get a chance to share her problems with family members and neighbours,” she added. D Roopa, IGP, railways, said that during the lockdown, it is quite difficult for women in distress to call the helpline and seek help. “So, many women may be not coming forward to file complaints of harassment, leading to decline in calls of abuse cases,” she informed. With 42 calls, Bengaluru reported the most number of domestic violence calls. There were seven such calls from Mandya district, six from Chikkaballapur, five from Tumakuru and four from Belagavi.

","Domestic violence cases in Chennai up, cops get 25 calls a day","CHENNAI: Until March 24, the torture at her alcoholic husband’s hands lasted barely an hour for Shanthi*. During the lockdown, the 35-year-old has told police, she is harassed 24x7 as the daily wager remains home, denied alcohol. There has been a spike in domestic violence cases, say police, adding that the control room on an average received 25 calls a day during the period. At least 40 cases were registered, with the complaints mainly from lower strata of society. Techies and wives of businessmen too have called police, but have not come forward with a written petition. Some women call the control room out of frustration, but disconnect without giving details, believing that this alone would scare men into mending their ways. In most cases, police officers have found, consumption of liquor is the cause of all trouble, followed by fights over not sharing household chores, baby-sitting, spying on each other’s mobile phones, switching television channels and constant demand for sex. Immediately after receiving a call, a patrol vehicle is sent to the house. In some cases, police try to reach a compromise if the victim demands; in others, cases are booked and the perpetrators warned. With restrictions on mobility, women are often unable to leave home to find safety in friends or their extended family. Most men, police say, don’t like to be monitored and vent their frustration on women. M Ravi, ADGP in charge of crimes against women and children, said he had instructed field level officers and policewomen to randomly visit vulnerable areas and susceptible households to check on women and children. Dr Lakshmi Vijayakumar, founder of Sneha, said couples should create safe space for themselves. In case things go out of control, they should distance themselves from each other especially when kids are at home. (*name changed) "

",Domestic violence sees uptick in Andhra Pradesh during lockdown,"VIJAYAWADA: The Covid-19 lockdown has led to an increase in incidents of domestic violence in the state. The number of reported cases has increased, even as other crimes have decreased during the lockdown. Some victims of domestic abuse are also averse to lodging complaints as they won’t be able to move away from the perpetrator during the lockdown. Kritika Shukla, director of the department of women development and child welfare said that 117 cases were reported from Disha One Stop centres between March 23 and April 21. Of these 117 cases, 45 relate to domestic violence, 11 to rape, 3 to sexual harassment, 9 to child sexual abuse, 5 to cybercrime against women, 5 missing cases, 1 child marriage and 38 others. Statistics establish that incidents of domestic violence have increased in the state during the lockdown, Shukla said. She informed that the department would receive 10 complaints a week earlier, which has now gone up to 20 cases a week. The main reason for increase in domestic violence, according to Shukla, is that the men are at home and venting their frustration on the women of the household while refusing to cooperate in domestic work. She further said that the unavailability of alcohol is also causing men to get further frustrated. Shukla said that upon receiving complaints, teams from the department are counselling the victims, their husbands as well as other members of the family. Srivani Koyyana, member of AP State Women’s Commission said that salary cuts, job losses and an uncertain future is leading to some of these incidents. She said that some of those who have lost their jobs during the lockdown are venting out their frustration on their wives. Koyyana said that according to accounts of some women, the fights and violence going on at their homes is like never before. Many are not coming forward to lodge complaints, Koyyana added. Vasireddy Padma, chairperson of AP State Women’s Commission said that the commission has introduced a WhatsApp helpline number: 6301411137 to address issues related to violence against women. Apart from the helpline, victims of domestic violence can call the director and the secretary of the commission. Victims can call R Suez, director of the commission, on 9701056808 and MJ Nirmala, secretary on 9603914511. "

",Complaints of domestic violence fall silent after complete lockdown,"BHOPAL: After complete lockdown in the city, complaints of domestic violence and child abuse have also stopped completely stopped leaving the Childline team worried. The Childline fears that the cases of domestic violence and child-abuse at home are not being reported. Concerned about the safety and well-being of children, the Childline team is now in a fix. “When the lockdown began, we used to get around 20-30 calls related to domestic violence as alcoholic people were becoming violent due to nonavailability of liquor. We also rescued some children and sent them to shelter homes to ensure their safety,” said City Childline director Archana Sahaye. She said that ever since the complete lockdown was enforced on April 5, complaints related to domestic violence against children completely stopped. “I feel that children cooped up with family members are not able to get a chance to report any domestic violence cases because of the complete lockdown. Severe shortage of food and other essentials has only added to the woes. Lack of information about such cases of domestic violence is worrisome as we do not know what the children might be facing and given that we do not know the victims, we are unable to rescue them,” added Sahaye.

",Naveen praises cops for keeping domestic violence ‘under control’,"Bhubaneswar: Incidents of domestic violence during the lockdown have not reached alarming proportions yet in Odisha, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said on Tuesday. Naveen had earlier expressed concern over the rise in cases of domestic violence in the country and had asked police in the state to keep a strict watch on known offenders. In a video conference with senior police officers, Naveen reviewed crime in the state, especially cases of domestic violence, and appreciated the force for tackling it well. He specifically reviewed the status of the phone-up programme launched by police, under which cops have been calling up women who had been earlier subjected to domestic violence to ask about their well-being. Police have so far called up 5,649 women, all victims of domestic violence, in the past few weeks. Of them, only one per cent said they continued to face violence at home. “Police promptly initiated action against the offenders. Law and order is under control in Odisha,” read a statement from the chief minister’s office. Anti-liquor activists, however, said domestic violence was under control because of the ban on sale of liquor during the lockdown. “We have been hearing reports that the government will open liquor shops soon. We fear that cases of domestic violence will go up if this happens,” said Prasanta Mohanty, an anti-liquor activist. In the video conference, the chief minister also took stock of the enforcement of the lockdown. Naveen’s statement said at least 6,500 people have been booked and 47,000 vehicles seized across the state so far for violations . "

",Domestic violence calls up from 10 to 25 a day during lockdown in Bengaluru,"BENGALURU: It’s 11.25am on Wednesday and one of the two telephones at Parihar Vanitha Sahayavani (women’s helpline) at the police commissionerate is ringing off the hook. Counsellor Bindya Yohannan picks it up only to lend an ear to a woman from Marathahalli who’s being repeatedly assaulted by her husband and his mother. The 21-day lockdown to check the Covid-19 spread has confined people to their homes but led to exponential rise in domestic violence cases in Bengaluru. Distress calls to the police control room by abused girls/women have multiplied since March 24, the day the shutdown was enforced. Flooded with calls, police decided to press into service staff from Parihar (the family counselling centre that runs the helpline along with police), who were working from home due to the lockdown. Earlier, Parihar was mostly referred women’s abuse cases by police stations. The Parihar staff were provided a temporary phone counselling facility and assistance from Hoysala vehicles, if necessary. “Our eight-member team began working in two shifts from 8am to 8pm April 4 onwards. We started addressing calls made to the control room (100) pertaining to women’s issues and providing detailed counselling on the phone,” said Rani Shetty, head of Parihar. On an average, the police control room is now receiving at least 25 distress calls related to domestic violence every day, while some women directly call the helpline. Prior to the lockdown, the control room would get not more than 10 such calls. Though Parihar had a functional helpline, it barely got direct calls as it’s not well known. There’s also a significant jump in the number of complaints referred to Parihar by various police stations. “The Marathahalli woman, 29, was being subjected to physical torture by her husband and mother-in-law. Taking into consideration the gravity of the situation, we dispatched a Hoysala team who took the woman to her acquaintance as per her request,” Yohannan said. Beat police personnel are exercising caution while addressing these cases by using thermal guns to ascertain if the people they engage with are healthy. Otherwise, they can call an ambulance. Calls to the helpline are often made by women who are being tormented by their spouses or other family members or are experiencing trouble in relationships. Sometimes, they are to do with missing girls. On Wednesday afternoon, senior counsellor Preethi Baliga attended a call from a Koramangala woman perturbed over her missing 17-year-old daughter. “The mother claims she was last seen with a boy. We are trying to contact him. It can be extremely taxing for parents, especially during the lockdown. Even for police, it can be quite a task to locate the victim,” said Baliga. "

","Air travel 'godsend' for some, a no-fly zone for many","Faridabad- based engineer Neeraj Gupta spent the whole of Friday trying to do something he would normally spend barely five minutes on: web check-in for the first flight home from Indore on Monday. He finally got his e-boarding pass on Saturday evening - after multiple tries, requests to customer care and complaints on the airline's Twitter handle.  ""I am hoping there are no more hitches. I just want to go home,"" Neeraj said on Sunday. As domestic airlines line up for a rather complicated post-Covid take-off after being grounded for more than two months, the sense of anticipation in the air has been tempered by apprehensions among flyers about last-minute cancellations because of some states either refusing to allow airport operations to resume or limiting the number of flights. State-specific quarantine and the middle-seat quandary have added to the uncertainty.  For Sunetra Mitra, a professor from Kolkata stranded in Shimla, getting to Delhi to catch her scheduled flight amid the lockdown had been her primary concern until Bengal announced late on Sunday that flights would be allowed only from May 28. Aiman in Lucknow can't stop talking about how the opportunity to visit her native Jaipur on Eid is ""a godsend"" amid the lockdown gloom. Down south, Hyderabad-based techie Kamalika Sinha had been counting the hours and praying nothing goes wrong till her scheduled morning flight on Monday lands in Kolkata.  For every person eager to board the first flight out of a city, there are scores of others who need to travel but are wary of doing so for various reasons. Stuck in Mumbai, Deepak Rao is eager to return to his workplace Bengaluru and get to work so that his start-up goes live soon. But after being forced to postpone travel six times, he would rather wait some more time.

","Seek help, say Middle East women's groups as domestic violence surges","AMMAN/CAIRO: Coronavirus lockdowns have brought a surge in reports of domestic violence in the Middle East, women's groups have said, warning hard-won gains in protection for victims are at risk. In Lebanon, calls to a government domestic violence hotline have doubled; in Tunisia, authorities say cases have increased five-fold, while in Jordan, a video of a victim tearfully describing her abuse under lockdown has gone viral. Countries all over the world have reported increases in domestic violence as families are cooped up together at home, prompting the head of the United Nations Antonio Guterres to call for urgent government action. But the situation in the Middle East is particularly worrying, say women's rights activists, because governments have recently stepped up protections for those at risk. Some fear those fragile gains are being jeopardised by restrictions on movement to curb the spread of the coronavirus that have forced women behind closed doors. ""We're seeing the nature of the violence become more severe and there are more death threats,"" said Ghida Anani, founder and director of ABAAD, which runs shelters for women in Lebanon. ""With the cases that are turning up at the shelters right now, we're seeing a violence more severe than before the financial crisis and even during the revolution."" Domestic violence cases are up about 20% since the lockdown started in March, Anani told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Lebanon, where authorities have closed all but essential businesses. The lockdown has exacerbated the difficulties faced by many households in Lebanon, where a financial crisis led to a mass uprising in October 2019, with money worries a common factor in domestic violence. ABAAD is running Skype counselling sessions both for victims and for men with a history of violence. The group has also teamed up with the government to distribute family aid kits containing household essentials, family support brochures and helpline contacts, Anani said. Authorities are also playing a key role in Tunisia, where authorities say cases increased five-fold under a strict curfew that is being enforced by the army and has been extended until April 19. The government has allocated eight shelters for victims and their children with additional facilities planned, said Tigris al-Qatiri, who heads Tunisia's department for combating violence against women. The Association of Tunisian Women for Research and Development, a women's group, started a solidarity and awareness campaign under the slogan ""you are not alone"" in an effort to reach isolated victims. GOVERNMENTS OVERWHELMED Across the region, women's groups are desperately trying to get the message out to victims in isolation, with governments' attention diverted by the coronavirus crisis. Suad Abu-Dayyeh, consultant for women's rights campaigners Equality Now, said governments in the region had ""completely forgotten the whole issue of the violence against women aspect of coronavirus"". ""I imagine there's a lot of pressure on governments, but they have to take into consideration how to work with civil society organisations to deal with violence against women."" In Morocco, where a 2019 government survey found more than half of women experienced violence but less than 7% had reported it, advocacy group Mobilising for Rights Associates has launched an emergency response site with details of support services. Founding partner Stephanie Willman Bordat said violence was now being driven by men in lockdown with their families after long periods away. ""Because police resources are taken up with other things like enforcing the curfew... the men think they can get away with violence with impunity,"" she added. Women's groups have also had to intervene in Jordan, where the government's family protection department has been overwhelmed. But Salma Nims, secretary general of the Jordanian National Commission for Women, said the restrictions on movement meant they could offer only limited help - even as the problem grew. ""Usually the abuser is not at home, or the victim can leave the house to work or go to school but mitigation is now more difficult because they're stuck at home,"" Nims said from Amman, where a strict curfew has been in place since March 21. The issue was thrown into relief in Jordan when a video of a woman detailing how the abuse she had long faced became worse under lockdown went viral on social media. Nims said local groups were offering support over the phone and online, and sharing helpline numbers on social media with the message ""do not hesitate,"" encouraging victims to seek help in a country where two thirds of women never do.

India', has filed a case of domestic violence against her husband Ksh Shantakumar, also a former hockey player from Manipur. Arjuna awardee Surajlata, now a 39-year-old mother of two, has said in three police complaints that she had been suffering physical and mental abuse over dowry since getting married to Shantakumar in 2005. “Thinking of my children, I did not make the matter public earlier.” Surajlata decided to file a police complaint after an allegedly brutal assault by her husband when they were visiting Kapurthala in Punjab on November 8 last year. “I somehow managed to flee and reached Imphal on November 14. After getting myself treated at the JNIMS Hospital in Imphal, I filed a case of domestic violence on November 16,” she said. On January 10, she lodged another complaint against Shantakumar at Heingang police station in Imphal East, mentioning their history of domestic violence. But since the alleged assault in November had taken place in Punjab, the Manipur Police said the case had to be probed by the local police there. On February 15, Surajlata filed a case against Shantakumar at Sultanpur Lodhi police station in Kapurthala. Besides physical violence, Shantakumar would allegedly humiliate his wife by accusing her of “immoral behaviour” to get into the good books of senior officials and get an Arjuna award. Surajlata shot to international fame by leading India to a historic Commonwealth Games gold in women's hockey at Manchester in 2002. The next year, the team won the Intercontinental Afro-Asian Games under her captaincy and the Asia Cup in Delhi in 2004. "

Across the world from Spain to Brazil, calls to hotlines and desperate texts seeking help have shot up. Back home, the National Commission for Women says that between March 23 and April 1, as many as 257 women have reached out to for help. Of these, 13 women have registered complaints of rape and attempt to rape, 69 women sought protection from domestic violence and 77 others had various complaints such as dowry and online harassment. Maximum complaints were from UP (90), followed by Delhi (37), Bihar and Odisha (18 each).  NCW chief Rekha Sharma said that the worrying thing is that women are scared to complain during a lockdown. ""They do not want to go to the police as they fear that if the husband is taken away, the in-laws will abuse them as they are living in the same house. There is no option of moving out and going to the parents' house,"" Sharma pointed out.  The NCW chief cited the example of a woman from Nainital who had sought assistance to be moved out of her abusive husband's house to a hostel till the lockdown ends. ""This woman's husband was beating and abusing her but she was not willing to go to the police as she feared what if the police released him and he returned home, he would beat her again. Her parents live in Delhi and she cannot reach them in these circumstances.""  To help more women get help, WEFT (Women Entrepreneurs For Transformation) Foundation, a non-profit, has launched a new initiative called 'red dot' under which domestic violence victims can put a red dot on their palms to alert people. ""Citizens who see the red dot on the palm can either get in touch with WEFT through social media or email weinfo@gmail.com or call 181 which is a toll free number to get support,"" WEFT founder Iti Rawat told agencies. The initiative launched three days ago has received over 20 complaints of domestic violence from across the country, said Rawat. Sharma shared that the Commission has taken action to help the complainants in 237 of the 257 complaints registered. All these are online complaints and currently the only point of access during the lockdown, as the Commission's public interface at its headquarters has stopped. "

","Domestic flights to resume from Monday, bookings begin today","NEW DELHI: Domestic flights will finally start taking to the skies from Monday (May 25) in a gradual manner, exactly two months after being stopped as part of the national lockdown imposed to check the spread of coronavirus. Bookings will start from Thursday. However, schedule international flights, which were stopped on March 22, will stay grounded for now. Airports will aim for contactless entry of flyers when the air services resume. Aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri tweeted on Wednesday: “Domestic civil aviation operations will recommence in a calibrated manner from Monday (May 25). Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for passenger movement are also being separately issued by the aviation ministry.” The ministry is also looking at fare-capping by putting upper and lower limits that airlines can charge for different routes to ensure reduced operations do not lead to an abrupt hike in spot fares. And also to prevent airlines — most of whom are struggling to survive — from charging below cost fares due to competition. Middle seats are unlikely to be kept vacant on flights to keep fares affordable and airlines, who are yet to get any real relief from the government, financially viable. Operations likely to start with 1/3rd of approved summer flightsWhile blueprint of the new normal will be announced on Thursday, flight resumption could start with one-third of the originally approved summer schedule of 24,409 weekly domestic flights taking to the skies again. Passengers will need to report to airports at least two hours before before flight time as social distancing will have to be observed at different levels. Thermal screening will be done on departure and arrival. While the aviation ministry’s SOPs are awaited, state-run Airports Authority of India (AAI) had said on May 15 that downloading and registering on the Aarogya Setu App; doing web check-in and taking a print out of boarding card to airport will be mandatory to fly when schedule flights begin. Passengers will need to wear masks throughout the journey. Passengers have been allowed to carry 350 ml liquid hand sanitiser on board aircraft with them to sanitise hands frequently till up to August 13, 2020, for now. Also the requirement of CISF stamping boarding cards has been done away with. The ministry’s draft SOP had spoken of only allowing people with a green light on their Aarogya Setu App to fly. In the first phase of flight resumption, people over 80 and cabin baggage was not to be allowed as per the draft SOP. What eventually finds way in the final rules remains to be seen. Check-in luggage may be limited to one bag per passenger. Passengers will need to submit a questionnaire about their past history related to Covid-19 and quarantine, if any, in the last one month, as per the draft. Any passenger who has undergone quarantine in the last one month to be sent for security check at isolated units. Boarding will be done to avoid crowding by asking people in rear rows to board first and disembarking will also be done in a manner that people don’t need to cross each other during the process.

","Ahmedabad lockdown: Assault cases up 86%, domestic violence 12%","AHMEDABAD: Soumya (name changed), 32, an executive with a city-based company, called the Abhayam 181 helpline when she could no longer take the verbal abuse from her husband which had been going on for a week. “She had to balance work with her domestic responsibilities. While she also works from home like her husband, she was expected to also cook and clean and the couple had frequent fights over small issues,” said a counsellor with Abhayam. As the fifth week of the lockdown ended on Wednesday, the EMRI 108 and 181 helplines have recorded an increase in cases of assault, falls and domestic violence. EMRI said that compared to usual, the fourth week of the lockdown had 86% more assault cases and domestic violence cases were up by 12%. Compared to 77 calls received for assault and 136 for domestic violence every day, the numbers have risen to 142 and 152, respectively. Jashvant Prajapati, COO of EMRI Gujarat, said that immediately after the lockdown began, the number of cases had fallen. “But in the fourth week, it picked up. We believe it could be due to the increase in stress,” he said. “Almost all social classes are calling helplines with these issues. They are not specific to the lower socio-economic strata.” City-based psychiatrist Dr Kalrav Mistry, who is also on panel of the NIMHANS helpline, said that Covid-19 has changed the way we live under one roof. “The lack of domestic help in middle and upper class homes for cooking and cleaning is a major stress point among couples and in-laws. Expectations from the husband or in-laws can induce stress. Often, it also trickles down to the children as parents scold them over trivial issues,” he said. “We advise proper division of labour, lowering expectations and to never fight in front of children.” "

",Trichy: Cops on vigil to prevent domestic violence during lockdown,"TRICHY: Unconfirmed reports of women being subjected to violence and harassment at home during the Covid-19 lockdown have pushed Trichy range police to embark on a move to keep a tab on around 15,000 victims of domestic violence in five districts in the past to check whether they still suffer in silence. A couple of weeks into lockdown since April 24, social media were abuzz with messages regarding harassments against women from their husbands and in-laws. Though the messages were laced with humorous memes, Trichy range police took it on a serious note and jumped into action few days ago. Police said that there may be incidents of alcohol addicts venting their anger towards women due to the unavailability of liquor. There could be several reasons for the angry outburst of the men towards women. They may not come to light owing to the abnormal situation right now. Police pulled out files of 14,930 domestic violence cases from 2017 till March 2020 in the jurisdiction of 15 All-women police stations (AWPS) in Trichy, Pudukottai, Karur, Perambalur and Ariyalur. They got cracking the cases wasting no time. Most of them were solved cases. “One of the reasons of taking this task is the messages of domestic violence during the lockdown. Whether it is true or not, we want to verify it by calling the victims directly,” deputy inspector general (DIG) of police V Balakrishnan told ToI. Police personnel in the 15 AWPS police stations were given the task of calling up the woman complainants and check with them whether they have any issues related to domestic violence from husband and in-laws. The DIG also said, “People, especially women are not coming out during the lockdown. If we call them, the victims will gain confidence and perpetrators may have a sense of fear.” Police personnel have been told to handle the issue carefully so that it does not create any fresh trouble to the women in the family. They have prepared a questionnaire including general verification questions about Covid-19 prevention measures such as wearing mask, social distancing and questions about domestic violence. “We are very clear that our effort will not affect the harmony in the family,” he said citing harsh reactions from some victims. The victims will also be asked to answer if the lockdown period caused any rift between the husband and wife. They will also be advised to contact medical helpline 104 and 108 in case of any medical need related to Covid-19 or any other health issues. Police would also ask whether they need any police protection while stepping out. For those who are not picking the calls, police will go to the address and check with them casually. “In case of any issues, we will take legal action against the perpetrators,” said the DIG. Appreciating the proactive move, lawyer T Jayanthi Rani suggested police to check with the women whether there is any child sex abuse. “There may be cases of child sex abuses by the perverts in the house. The lockdown may have aggravated their perversion. Women may be afraid of revealing it,” said Jayanthi Ranee. "

Jawahar Nagar police said that the complainant, a resident of Kowkur, got married to one C Vinay in 2013. Few months after their marriage, Vinay allegedly began to harass the woman when they were staying together in France. The complainant said that in 2014 her mother-in-law brought her to Hyderabad on the pretext of renewing her visa. She added that her mother-in-law left the country a few days later, telling her that Vinay would visit India shortly and take her along with him to France. She alleged that later Vinay and his parents became inaccessible over phone and emails. She then approached Jawahar Nagar police and lodged a case of domestic violence against her husband and in-laws. "

",‘Murdered Gurugram BJP neta faced domestic violence’,"GURUGRAM: Haryana BJP Kisan Morcha leader Munesh Godara, who was allegedly shot dead on Saturday night by her husband Sunil — a private security officer and a former Armyman — had suffered domestic violence and abuse for several years, her family alleged on Monday. Sunil Jhakkar, brother of 35-year-old Munesh, told TOI that after Munesh wed Sunil Godara at the age of 15, she never managed to lead a ‘normal married life’ as her husband often used to beat her. In 2013, Jhakkar added, Munesh had tried to kill herself by consuming poison after she was thrashed and locked inside the house by Sunil. This was the same year Munesh was appointed as the BJP Mahila Morcha chief in Haryana, a post she held till 2016. “We filed complaints against Sunil at least 15 times for domestic violence,” said Jhakkar. Sunil Godara’s father Dalip Singh, who was the original complainant in the case, had accused his son, along with two others, Bunty Gujjar and his Anu, of murder. Singh had told police that the couple often had arguments because Sunil suspected Munesh had an affair with Gujjar. On Monday, Jhakkar submitted a complaint to the police commissioner accusing Sunil and Dalip Singh of conspiracy for murder. Jhakkar, who was accompanied by Gujjar, dismissed all allegations against the latter, saying, “Claims of my sister having an affair are rumours.” According to his complaint, “Sunil Godara and his father had made a plan to kill my sister. He had been beating her ever since they got married.” He also alleged that the father-son duo had been eyeing the property that was in Munesh’s name. Jhakkar said on Saturday, he dropped his sister to her Spaze Privy house in Sector 93 around 9:20 pm. “My younger sister Manisha was speaking to Munesh on the phone when she heard her saying that she has been shot,” he said. At the time of the incident, Munesh had been working in the kitchen. The couple’s children — a son and a daughter — were also present in the house. Dalip had said in his complaint that after their argument escalated, Sunil took out his revolver and shot Munesh. Sources said Sunil had then put the gun to his head, but was stopped by his son. He fled thereafter. Police, which formed teams for the investigation, are trying to locate him, said ACP Prit Pal. Sunil was earlier employed with the Army and had been forced to take voluntary retirement due to his conduct. "

",UNDRR asks Govts to include domestic violence risk in their DRR plan,"NEW Delhi: The UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) has called for inclusion of domestic violence risk in the Covid-19 response plan of all the national disaster management authorities to combat rising cases of violence against women and children. “Measures to combat domestic violence need to be given attention and addressed by national disaster management agencies,” said Mami Mizutori, the UN secretary-general’s special representative for disaster risk reduction (DRR) and head of the UNDRR. Mizutori said that women and girls are more affected by disasters generally because of the gender inequality evident in society at large. “They die and are injured in greater numbers particularly in extreme weather events. This unfortunate reality has taken a new twist in the COVID-19 pandemic,” she said. The lockdown and restrictions imposed by governments on their movement have further put them in jeopardy, trapped in abusive domestic situations. “I call on all national disaster management agencies to give attention to this urgent issue within their governments so that support to victims of domestic abuse is included in their COVID-19 response plans. This will save lives and prevent serious injury to many,” Mizutori said. She also asked governments for adequate allocation of funds and shelter for “women and girls escaping domestic abuse”. It also means increasing the level of online support services including helplines to police and social services, the UNDRR chief said. “Facilities such as supermarkets and pharmacies that remain open, should be on alert to receive pleas for help from women seeking support without worry that their abusers will be alerted. We need to find safe and creative ways for women to seek support,” Mizutori said. "

Or booze crisis behind dip in domestic violence?,"CHANDIGARH: Shot up elsewhere, domestic violence dropped by 50% in this city during the first 13 days of lockdown, even though the tormented are now shut in with their tormentors. The dip might be because of under reporting, as most sufferers have assumed police force to be too busy with enforcing Covid-19 curfew to have any time for other matters. Between March 9 and 22, police received 184 calls from battered wives, and another 93 cases of domestic violence and matrimonial dispute from March 23 to April 4. Vikramjeet Singh, officer in charge of women's and child helpline, confirmed that the city was reporting fewer cases of domestic violence. He said: ""Since the lockdown began, only five complaints reached helpline 181 till April 15. All the cases were resolved. Complaints have decreased because of both under reporting and unavailability of liquor. Earlier, most of the women who called us for help wanted to be saved from their drunken husbands."" Deputy superintendent of police Charanjit Singh Virk of the women's and child support unit said: ""The numbers of complaints coming to the control room, SSP's window, and women's cell have decreased all of a sudden. Due to lockdown and social distancing, complainants and the accused aren't being called to the women's cell for counselling."" After the curfew is lifted, this number might change because of investigations. Cops from the women's cell are also on curfew duty. Of the last 93 complaints, 12 related to harassment and assault by husbands and five to marital disputes, which were also marked to the SSP's public window. During the curfew, even the women's police station registered two FIRs (first-information reports) of domestic violence but made no arrest due to lockdown. Police parties, however, went to the spot and ended those brawls. However, later these reached the SSP's public window via email and now will be addressed only after the lockdown. Confined to their homes and unable to reach the police cell, many women area also not enough computer savvy to lodge a complaint online. A cop in the women's cell said: ""They always came to the public window in normal days, when the number of complaints was 14 to 16 a day and not seven to eight of today."" "

","Domestic flights will resume in a calibrated, gradual manner: Hardeep Singh Puri","NEW DELHI: The government will soon decide when domestic schedule passenger flights resume but whenever that happens, the scale of operations will be much less than the level at which they stopped in late March. Aviation minister H S Puri, while giving details of repatriation flights on Tuesday, said: “When we open up schedule flights, it will be in a calibrated and graded manner. If I stick my neck out (to do some crystal-gazing), it may restart at 25% (of what was stopped in March-end) and increased gradually by 10% in a graded manner.” Coronavirus outbreak: Live updatesIndia had stopped schedule commercial flights, both domestic and international, on March 22 and 25. At that time the winter schedule was in force which had approved 10,310 weekly domestic flights by schedule airlines — almost 1,500 flights daily. The corona pandemic has severely impacted travel and in last few days of March at least 40% of this schedule had been slashed, meaning less than 900 domestic daily flights were being operated when they were suspended. Rs 12,000 to Rs 1 lakh: How much money Indians will need to pay to fly back home“We cannot open up as it was pre-flight suspension. If we open all flights, how will a person in a red zone catch the flight? It has to be very calibrated,” Puri said.

The first week of operations will bring back about 15,000 passengers on 64 flights from 12 countries, six of which are in Gulf and the remaining being USA, UK, Bangladesh, Singapore, Malaysia and Philippines. “We do not know the final numbers of Indians who wish to return. It may be 4 lakh but the final number will be known in a few days. How we ramp up operations after the first week depends on factors like our experience of the first week; the states’ readiness to receive people flying in these flights in terms of quarantine centres and hospitals and the behaviour of the virus,” the minister said.

Of the 370 complaints registered by NCW between March 23 to April 10, 123 pertain to domestic violence and of these 46 have been received from April 6 to 10. To encourage more women to come forward and report and for those unable to reach out through the online mode, emails and social media, the Commission on Friday activated a WhatsaApp alert number 7217735372 for the period of lockdown and for alerts only pertaining to domestic violence. The complainant can send a whatsapp message alert and the Commission will respond with assistance. It is clearly stated in the NCW public notice that this number is not meant for calls and SMS. Since the lock down came into effect, off the streets, inside homes the ugly face of violence is threatening the safety of many more women caught in abusive relationships. Between March 23 to April 10 besides the 123 women who complained against domestic violence, 117 complained to the Commission seeking help to secure their human right to live a life of dignity. There have also been 21 complaints related to harassment by married women and dowry. During this period NCW has received a total of 11 complaints related to sexual harassment, 11 pertaining to molestation and outraging the modesty of a woman and 10 related to stalking and voyeurism. The Commission has also received 27 complaints related to cyber- crimes.

On April 2 she had said that since the lock down “complaints of domestic violence were increasing by the day”. However, she shared that due to the lock down fewer women were willing to report the crime to the police as they are living with abusive husbands and in-laws under one roof and fear they will be tortured further as they are restricted to the house. Earlier this week, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres in a video message called on governments across the world for urgent measures to address the ""horrifying global surge in domestic violence"" directed at women and girls amid growing fear and economic and social pressures arising out of the circumstances due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It also showed 404 of the 428 flights arrived at their destinations on Monday itself. Remaining 28 flights reached their destinations on Tuesday (after midnight) after departing from their origin city on Monday (just before midnight).

Meanwhile, the figures shared by the ministry through the excel sheet on the total number of Monday's flights were lower than the figures shared by Puri on Monday evening.

In her FIR, the woman, who has two children, alleged that her in-laws and husband held her to be a ‘bad omen’ for them and blamed her for the death of her first child, a girl, who drowned in a pond near her husband’s house in Patan. In her FIR with Ghatlodia police, the woman stated that she married a Patan-based man in 2006 according to the wishes of her family. “They used to taunt me, telling me how bad I looked. My husband told me to undergo cosmetic surgery, saying that my nose is flat and I do not look good. Whenever I countered him, he would hit me,” she said in the FIR. She further states that her husband would compare her looks with other female members of the family and kept harassing her. In 2008, she left her husband’s house and filed a case of domestic violence in Patan, but was forced to strike a compromise due to the intervention of her family members. She later reconciled with her husband and delivered their first child in 2009. She died in four months after she slipped into a pond near the house in Patan. Her in-laws and husband blamed her for the accident, saying she was a ‘bad omen’ for the family, states the FIR.

",Last-minute cancellations cause chaos as air travel resumes,"NEW DELHI: Domestic air travel had a bumpy take-off on its comeback on Monday after two months of being grounded, thanks to an already sanitised first-day schedule being almost halved at short notice to leave hundreds of stranded flyers marooned again in a mess of last-minute coordination between the civilian aviation ministry and states. Day One saw 532 flights operate, ferrying 39,231 passengers to various destinations. While many of these flights had rows of empty seats, thousands of flyers were left agonising over roughly the same number of flight cancellations. The schedule for Monday was finalised after talks between the aviation ministry and some states ended late Sunday night with the decision that some airports like Kolkata, Bagdogra, Vijaywada and Vishakhpatnam will open only later this week while others like Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad would have a strict cap on the number of flights,"" a senior official of a private airline said. He said the airline started informing passengers about cancellations or changes in flight timings only around midnight on Sunday. ""There was utter confusion till just hours before flights were to recommence. Passengers who were to travel on Monday's cancelled flights blamed us, not realising that it was not our fault that they had to suffer."" The night curfew from 7pm to 7am added to the chaos, with some passengers turning up at the airports on Sunday night itself. ""Some Kolkata-bound passengers arrived at Delhi airport's Terminal-3 on Sunday night. Around 8pm, when it became known that Kolkata airport would open for scheduled flights only from Thursday (May 28), we informed them that their flight had been cancelled,"" another airline official said. State-specific quarantine protocols, too, seemed to leave flyers wary and confused. Uttarakhand, which has made 10 days of paid quarantine in various categories of hotels mandatory for all flyers, reported only three arriving passengers on a morning flight from Delhi. An IndiGo A-320 flight from Bengaluru to Goa had just 30 passengers. In Goa, a flyer can go home directly only if the person is carrying a Covid-negative certificate issued by an ICMR-recognised lab not more than 48 hours earlier. Everyone else has to pay Rs 2,000 for a test and be quarantined at home or opt for 14 days of institutional quarantine. Times ViewWith each state following its own protocol for air travellers (TOIcarried a detailed graphic in yesterday’s edition), there are almost as many different protocols as there are states. Some of them seem prima facie to be unworkable, like the demand for Covid negative certificates at a time when individuals can’t just choose to get tested. In any case, to expect each person wanting to take a flight to be tracking what protocols apply to him or her in the state from which the flight originates and the one in which it lands is unrealistic. While the general principle of allowing states greater leeway in deciding what measures they take to protect their citizens cannot be faulted, there are situations in which it can become impractical. This is one such. It would be best if there were asingle set of rules applicable for all air travel across the country. In devising those rules, what needs to be kept in mind is that there are, at the moment, broadly two kinds of people wanting to take flights — those who were stuck in the wrong city because of the lockdown and want to get back home, and those who need to travel for work or business. The two categories can’t be treated similarly. Those returning home may not mind home quarantine for a week or two (at the most), but clearly a business traveller can’t afford it. Some states have made this distinction and exempted business travellers from quarantine. That should become the national norm. Also, given that no protocol is foolproof, the effort should be keep the guidelines simple, liberal and practical.In Video:Domestic air travel's bumpy take-off on its comeback"

He raises concern that in some countries the number of women reaching out to support services for help has doubled. A video of the Secretary General's appeal put out by the United Nations on his official twitter handle comes with his message that “Peace is not just the absence of war. Many women under lockdown for #COVID19 face violence where they should be safest: in their own homes. Today I appeal for peace in homes around the world. I urge all governments to put women’s safety first as they respond to the pandemic."" In his appeal, the UN Secretary General states,""We know lockdowns and quarantines are essential for suppressing COVID19 but they can trap women with abusive partners. Over the past weeks as economic and social pressure and fear have grown we have seen a horrifying global surge in domestic violence. In some countries the number of women calling support services has doubled,” he adds. Emphasising on the challenges, he points that “meanwhile, healthcare providers and police are overwhelmed and understaffed. Local support groups are paralysed or short of funds. Some domestic violence shelters are closed; others are full."" In this backdrop he urges all governments to make prevention and redress of violence against women a key part of their national response plans for COVID-19. He goes on to elaborate that measures will involve increasing investment in online services and civil society organisations and making sure that judicial systems continue to prosecute abusers. There is a need to set-up up emergency warning systems in pharmacies and groceries. the Secretary General calls for declaring shelters as essential services and creating safe ways for women to seek support, without alerting their abusers.

",Domestic flights to resume services in Kolkata on May 28,"KOLKATA: Domestic flights to and from Kolkata will resume from May 28 (Thursday), instead of May 25 (Monday), following a request of Bengal government on Saturday, which cited the twin crisis of Covid-19 pandemic and cyclone disaster in south Bengal. Flights to Bagdogra will also resume on May 28. The decision was conveyed to Kolkata airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee by the ministry of civil aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola on Sunday evening, hours before the first flight was slated to take off from the city on Monday morning. All airlines were on tenterhooks till the decision was announced around 7.45pm on Sunday. Sources said the number of flights would also be scaled down significantly from around 93 mentioned in the initial list to around 20. The Maharashtra government has limited the number of Mumbai- bound flights to 25 while Telangana government has said it will allow only 15 flights to Hyderabad. The delay in operations has led to discontentment among flyers, airlines and travel agents with the ire being directed at the civil aviation ministry and regulator DGCA for not consulting the states before announcing the commencement date. “The manner, in which the flight resumption was handled, is immature and ad hoc. More planning and coordination goes into introduction of an inter-state bus route. The opinions of the state government should have been sought before the date was announced. That would have spared so much confusion in the industry and people,” said travel agent Manoj Saraf. While GoAir had refused to open its bookings from May 25, citing the lack of clarity and confusion over the flight operations, other airines that went by the DGCA order and opened bookings are now in a quandary over what to do with hundreds of passengers who have booked flights between May 25 and May 27. “This is the third instance of bookings being opened and then flights being cancelled since the lockdown was announced. Not only does this lead to loss of passenger confidence in the airline, it also reflects very poorly on the airline industry in India,” said an airline official. Confused over whether this will again lead to problems in refunding the tickets, passengers frantically called travel agents and airline offices. Till late on Sunday, there was no clarity on the issue. “Many passengers already have their money stuck in credit notes issued earlier by airlines. But processing the credit notes for tickets purchased via travel agents is still a problem. Those desperate to travel put in their money again to book tickets.

","Air travel bookings open, not too many takers on day one","MUMBAI: Day one of opening of domestic air travel bookings from May 25 saw a tepid response from passengers, and tickets for most routes were available throughout the day at reasonable fares. The fares are capped and so there won’t be any exorbitantly high rates for the next three months till August 24. But, it is the second air fare norm put out by the government that works as an indicator of sales. According to the new rules, airlines have to sell 40% seats at a fare that is lower than the mid-point of the fare band. For instance, on the Mumbai-Delhi route, fare is capped between Rs 3,500 and Rs 10,000 and the mid-point is Rs 6,700 (the fares do not include taxes and fees such as passenger development fee and GST). On Friday evening, almost 24 hours after bookings for May flights were open (prior to that tickets for travel from June 1 were only available), the cheapest Mumbai-Delhi ticket for travel on May 25 was priced at Rs 6,300 (taxes included) for a 5.30am Air India flight.

One could also buy an 8.40 am AirAsia flight for Rs 7,400, which is a fare just above the mid-range since it includes taxes. The Mumbai-Delhi flights that crossed the Rs 10,000 mark were those that departed between 6.30 am onwards in the morning. “Had the demand been high, most morning departures would have sold out and late evening departures would have touched the Rs 10,000 mark. If the fares haven’t crossed the mid-point band, it means less than 40% tickets have been sold on that particular flight,” said a travel agent. Travel portals, though, said they had received “an overwhelming response on nearly all metro routes”. Dhruv Shringi of yatra.com said: “Bookings today are trending at 40% of pre-Covid levels. With the capping of air fares, we hope bookings to increase further.” "

",Fears of domestic violence rise as millions confined over virus,"BERLIN: With families across Europe confined to their homes to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, fears are rising of a surge in domestic violence. From Berlin to Paris, Madrid, Rome and Bratislava, associations that help victims of domestic violence have sounded the alarm after Europe overtook China to become the epicentre of the pandemic. ""For many people, their home is already not a safe place,"" says the German federal association of women's counselling centres and helplines (BFF). Coronavirus outbreak: Complete coverageRead our coronavirus live blog for all the latest news and updatesBut the stress caused by social isolation is exacerbating tensions and increasing ""the risk of domestic and sexual violence against women and children"", the association warns. And the risks are not limited to homes where violence was already a problem before. On top of the stress caused by confinement, fears around job security and financial difficulties are also increasing the likelihood of conflicts. ""It's putting a lot of pressure on households,"" says Florence Claudepierre, head of the FCPE parents' federation in the Upper Rhine, a region hit hard by the pandemic in France. She said she is hearing stories of ""parents who are cracking, who can't carry on"" in families that have not previously had any problems. In China, which is slowly emerging from several weeks of total lockdown, the women's rights organisation Weiping has reported a threefold increase in reports of violence against women. In Spain, which has the second-worst outbreak in Europe after Italy, a 35-year-old mother of two was murdered by her partner last week. Elsewhere, help centres have noted a drop in calls for help -- which is not necessarily seen as a good sign either. For children, young people and women who are victims of domestic violence -- mental or physical -- the current situation means ""being constantly available"" for abuse by the perpetrator, the German federation stresses. Decisions to shut down schools, sports clubs and youth centres are important to curb the spread of the virus and prevent hospitals from being overrun, acknowledges Rainer Rettinger, who heads a German child protection association. But ""who is seeing and hearing abused children today?"" he asks. ""Now violence, too, has been confined. That's what we're afraid of,"" says Martine Brousse, head of Parisian organisation La Voix de l'Enfant (The Child's Voice). As governments pour billions into their economies and health services, they should ""not lose sight of the importance of equality and fundamental human rights,"" Beatrice Fresko-Rolfo, the general rapporteur on violence against women for the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, pointed out recently. Domestic violence associations are facing a double-edged sword: With many social workers having to work from home, they are unable to reach victims; and when people need to be brought to safety, there are often not enough places in the refuges. ""Women have called us and told us they are experiencing violence at home. They are asking: Where can I go?"" says Canan Gullu, from Turkey's federation of women's organisations. In Germany, families minister Franziska Giffey has called on municipalities to organise alternative reception facilities if necessary, while neighbouring Austria provides guaranteed places in women's refuges or the removal of violent family members from quarantined households. In the countries with the strictest lockdowns, such as Italy, victims are exempt from some of the rules -- such as the requirement to carry a document justifying why they are leaving their home -- if they need to visit a refuge centre.

","Five days after BJP neta’s murder, husband arrested","GURUGRAM: Sunil Godara, accused of killing his wife, BJP Kisan Morcha state secretary Munesh Godara, was on Sunday sent to Bhondsi jail after being produced in court. He had been on the run for five days since Munesh was murdered. A team from Sector 10A police and Farrukhnagar crime branch arrested him on Friday evening near Hayatpur junction. The revolver with which Munesh was shot was also seized — the licence was jointly registered for Sunil and Munesh. “He has been sent to jail, but investigation is still on,” said a police officer. The probe will now look into the involvement of others who have been named in the FIRs. The first FIR had been filed by Dalip Singh, Munesh’s father-in-law. He had accused his son Sunil, Bunty Gujjar — who Sunil suspected Munesh of being involved with, and Bunty’s wife Anu for the murder. According to Dalip, the couple would often fight over her alleged infidelity and on Sunday, he had said, an argument along the same lines had escalated and Sunil had shot Munesh in their kitchen. He had then left the society after an altercation with security guards, who said he was drunk at the time. A day after the murder, however, Munesh’s brother Sunil Jhakkar had filed another complaint, accusing Dalip. He said Munesh had been facing domestic violence for years and that Dalip and Sunil had plotted her murder. The motive, he had added, was that they were eyeing Munesh’s property. He had also said Munesh had tried to kill herself after she was beaten up and locked inside the house by Sunil in 2013. An FIR was registered for conspiracy for murder on the basis of his complaint at Sector 10A police station. Before taking charge as the state secretary for BJP Kisan Morcha, Munesh had been the chief of the BJP Mahila Morcha for three years till 2016. The couple lived in a rented flat at Spaze Privy society in Sector 93. Their children — a daughter and a son — were in another room in the house when Munesh was killed. TOI had earlier reported that Sunil had been an Army personnel but was asked to take voluntary retirement because of his conduct. He had since been working as a security officer with a private firm.

",Lookout circular for man in domestic violence case,"PUNE: A magisterial court here has directed the Chatushrungi police to issue a non-bailable warrant and a lookout circular for a man facing prosecution in a domestic violence case filed by his wife. The man, a former associate manager for technical support with a prominent IT firm, has been “untraceable” since December last, when the court issued a distress warrant following his failure to execute an earlier order, of July 20, 2018. In the earlier order, the had ordered the man to pay his wife Rs13,400 per month towards the monthly instalment for a Rs5.65 lakh personal loan. The man had forced his wife to take the loan from a private finance firm and had it transferred to his account. In her then plea to the court under the Domestic Violence Act, the wife did press for any maintenance, but wanted her husband to pay the monthly instalments of the loan. The court directed the man to pay the instalments from December 2017, when the plea was filed. “The man has since paid only Rs5,000, which is not even one instalment, and has run into arrears so far of Rs2.43 lakh,” lawyer Prasad Nikam, representing the wife, told TOI. Last August, the wife moved the court, praying for a distress warrant to be issued against her husband for recovery of the arrears. While this plea was pending, the husband moved an appeal with the sessions court and sought a stay on the July 20, 2018, order. However, additional sessions judge M M Deshpande rejected the plea for stay on January 1 this year, and his appeal is pending. Three days later, a magisterial court allowed the wife’s plea for a distress warrant, which could not be served on the husband as he had gone untraceable. The wife then moved another plea for a non-bailable warrant and lookout circular against her husband, which was heard by judicial magistrate first class J S Kelkar on July 20. The magistrate referred to Nikam’s submission that the man has been absconding and a distress warrant could not be served on him and held, “ ... in order to secure presence of (the husband), it is necessary to issue NBW and lookout circular against him.” The court directed the police to execute the order by August 31. “We will now pursue with the police authorities the matter of lookout circular as per the norms set by the Ministry of External Affairs,” Nikam told TOI. “The husband has in the past worked in the US. His parents have persistently claimed that they don’t know his whereabouts. We fear that he might leave India to evade action and sought a lookout circular,” he said. "

","Nashik: Social media culprit in many cases, says officer","NASHIK: Spending long hours on mobile phones, chatting or surfing the internet, and sharing of salaries by working women are among the reasons for domestic violence, said an officer attached to the Bharosa Cell on Tuesday. “Whether a woman or man, whoever is involved in spending too much time on the mobile phones, it leads to tension among couples,” police inspector Sangeeta Nikam of the cell told TOI. The officer added that a number of working women have also approached the cell with complaints that their husbands or in-laws demand that they surrender their salaries to them. Among such women complainants are professionals such as doctors and lawyers, said Nikam. Moreover, domestic violence complaints have shown an upward trend. According to data available with the cell, 976 complaints were lodged by women against their husbands or his relatives last year as against 678 in 201. Domestic violence victims generally go to a police station, who advise them to go to the Bhosara Cell, which was earlier known as the Women’s Security Cell. The women police officials at the cell try to address the issues by listening to the grievances of the women and call their husbands to know his side of the story. “Our primary goal is to try and reach a compromise between a couple so that they stay together. They are counselled so as to prevent their marriage from breaking,” said Nikam. “At the same time, the couples are also told about the legal hassles they would face if an offence is registered. At times, couples are called three to four times for counselling,” she said. The officer said that last year, out of 976 applicants, they could help reach a compromise between couples in 146 cases. “Some applicants were asked to lodge complaints through courts, where 259 women withdrew their applications after counselling and went back to stay with their husband,” said Nikam. However, 219 women decided to lodge police complaints against their husbands while the remaining applications are still pending. “Women coming with complaints are from all strata of society, including doctors, lawyers and teachers. Spending a long time chatting with friends on social media is observed in most of the cases. In many cases, the man is found suspecting his wife of infidelity or vice-versa.” Nikam said there are also complaints from working women that they are expected to do the entire household work and manage their jobs as well.

","Lockdown takes toll on women’s safety, rise in domestic violence since March in Goa","PANAJI: Violence against women has seen a spurt during the lockdown and Goa is no different. Sakhi, the one-stop centre at Bambolim that supports women affected by violence, has registered 26 cases since March and not only are most of the cases of domestic violence, but the numbers are also higher than what the centre sees normally. Once the lockdown lifts, Sakhi expects a further spike in these cases. “There have been more cases of domestic violence reported during the lockdown than other types of cases,” Sakhi coordinator Emidio Pinho said. Of 26 cases, eight pertained to sexual offences. Pinho said women facing domestic violence are unable to reach out for help with the lockdown in place and continue to live with the perpetrators of violence. If not all, some will seek help post lockdown, he said.“We expect more cases to be reported after the lockdown is lifted,” Pinho said. One of the cases of domestic violence involved an attempt to murder by the husband and the case was registered at Mapusa police station. The husband used a ‘paal koita’ — a type of sharp knife — to assault his wife. The woman almost lost her hand. All the cases of domestic violence are not necessarily that of wife beating, sometimes other male members of the household also assault the woman or women in the family. One case handled by Sakhi dealt with an aggressive husband. The familial dispute assumed drastic proportions due to communication issues between the husband and wife leading to a vitiated home atmosphere and a feeling of terror among family members. In desperation, the wife attempted suicide. However, timely intervention by Sakhi helped avert the tragedy, Pinho said. The family was counselled and every attempt was made to help so that the teenage children were not affected, he said. Among the sexual assault cases that Sakhi has handled since March 24 is one that saw a teenager being assaulted by a neighbour. The case was discovered after the 14-year-old girl was found to be more than 20 weeks pregnant. The pregnancy could not be terminated. “She delivered a baby, but it died immediately,” Pinho said. The girl was counselled after the incident and the accused, who is married and has children, was arrested. "

","Acting in domestic violence scenes was challenging, says Slovak-Hungarian actor","PUNE: Vica Kerekes is a truly European actress. Her parents are ethnically Hungarian but she is a Slovak national, having been born in erstwhile Slovakia, and she works in both Slovakia and Hungary. In Atilla Szasz’s mystery/thriller movie Tall Tales — Apro Mesek in Hungarian — she took on a challenging role, playing the wife left behind while her husband is on the battlefield, set in the immediate aftermath of World War II, while being the other half of a passionate affair with a con man on the run. The screenplay of the film is by the prolific screenwriter Norbert Kobli. Kerekes was in the city on Saturday for an interaction with the press on account of the Pune International Film Festival (PIFF). She was here to represent the film, which is part of the World Competition section and has two scheduled screenings, on January 10 and on Sunday, at the Inox Bund Garden. She spoke as part of an interaction with the festival’s creative director Samar Nakhate at the National Film Archives of India (NFAI). Despite the obvious challenges to the role, Kerekes, who had trained mainly in theatre at one of Hungary’s most famous acting institutes, said that she took on the role at the first available opportunity. “I have heard of this director for a long time and I had the wish of working with him. So when he put out the call for this film, I jumped on board. This was a difficult role. The story is complicated, with the war being viewed from the eyes of a woman. And there is the obvious tension of the husband being at war, while my character is back home, trying to survive with my child,” Kerekes said, while speaking about the film. Like other modern European cinema, this film does not shy away from the bold and shocking, which also took a physical and emotional toll on Kerekes, as she testified. “The character is a woman, who comes with her views as well as her sexuality that she is not afraid to express. And there is a lot of emotional and physical violence meted out against her. During the shooting, I was required to be slapped a number of times till the shot was correct. That took a physical toll as well as emotional, with the humiliation that comes with every slap,” she remarked. "

",Noida: Domestic helper reunited with kin after 7 years,"NOIDA: A woman working as a domestic staffer in a housing society was reunited with her family in Jharkhand after almost seven years with help from a few neighbours and a local NGO. The woman had seen images of migrant workers setting out for home on foot and reached out to a few neighbours. She was brought to Noida seven years ago and had been working at Eldeco Green Meadows society in Pi sector since then. Sadhna Sinha, president of the Mahila Shakti Samajik Samiti, said she had received information about the woman wanting to return home to Khunti district. “She was brought here as a domestic staffer by a middleman with whom she lost touch. She had been staying here for the past seven years and only now wanted to return home. Also, she was getting not getting paid regularly,” she said. Deputy commissioner of police (crime against women) Vrinda Shukla said the woman had not lodged any complaint against her employers. When the woman was questioned about her family, the only thing she could recollect was the name of her father and Khunti district. These details were shared with Jharkhand Police, who got in touch with the family. The woman’s brother was called to Greater Noida along with a team of district the anti-human trafficking unit. No action was taken against her employers as she hadn’t lodged any complaint. "

Police are suspecting it to be a suicide. The deceased, Neelam, a native of Basti, had come to stay with her sister on February 4. Her sister Kajal works in the flat as domestic help and stays with the family. The flat owner, Bajrang Dubey, works in an IT firm in Noida, said police.

Subsequently, their mother scolded Neelam over the phone and after a few hours, she jumped from the balcony of the flat. “Kajal told police that around 9pm, she was cooking dinner and Neelam was in the living room while Bajrang was in his room along with his wife and children. Suddenly, Neelam went towards the balcony and I also went behind her. Kajal talked to Neelam on the issue for some minutes and when Kajal turned towards the kitchen, Neelam jumped from the balcony,” Chaubey added. “She was rushed to a nearby hospital where she was declared dead on arrival.

",Covid-19: Domestic air travel may fall to 2015-16 levels this fiscal,"NEW DELHI: The coronavirus pandemic could take Indian aviation back at least four to five years. A Capa India report titled ""Covid-19 & the State of the Indian Aviation Industry"" said domestic air travel is expected to decline from an estimated 14 crore in fiscal 2019-20 to about 8-9 crore in FY 2020-21. According to DGCA data, the number of domestic air travellers in India in 2015 and 2016 was 8.1 crore and 9.9 crore, respectively. ""The Indian aviation sector is likely to shrink significantly, even if some of the vulnerable airlines manage to survive. Capa India estimates that there could be 200-250 surplus aircraft for the next 6-12 months… For India to return to a pre-Covid operational fleet of 650 aircraft is likely to take up to 12 months from the time that restrictions are lifted, and this may be conservative… International traffic is expected to fall from approximately 70 million in FY 2020 to 35-40 million in FY 2021, and possibly lower. These are Capa India’s initial estimates and will be continually revised,"" Capa India said in a report Monday. Starting May, Indian carriers are initially expected to return up to 100 aircraft to lessors, especially older planes. The number of returned aircraft will continue to increase significantly till September 2020, possibly reaching 200-250, or even higher, it said. Over 200 aircraft scheduled for delivery over the next couple of years (including 56 MAX aircraft) are likely to be deferred by 1-2 years. ""It was possible to bring activity to a halt overnight. In contrast, the resumption of operations is far more complex… forward bookings for domestic travel in May, June and July are currently down 80% year-on-year… When services resume, airlines will have to publish a schedule, which will require decisions to be made with respect to which routes to launch first and with what level of capacity… Some carriers may decide to operate very much a skeleton network only, on the basis that it may be better to keep aircraft grounded to conserve cash,"" it said. Post-Covid-19 travel is likely to change in terms of additional operational considerations like social distancing at airports and onboard; increased turnaround times to enable thorough cabin cleansing after each flight; limitations on inflight service; airport health checks as well as changes to security screening and immigration procedures, which may lengthen processing time. ""VFR (visiting friends and relatives) traffic would normally be the first to pick up as friends and families seek to reunite after months of separation. Discretionary international leisure travel may take even longer as this will be impacted by the weak economy,"" Capa India said, adding corporate travel for both small, medium and large businesses will be hit. ""Several foreign carriers have loaded flights for sale after the current lockdown ends, with services scheduled for resumption over a period of several weeks from April 16, 2020, onwards. However, it is as yet uncertain whether these flights will operate as planned… Despite the published schedules, at this stage most European and North American carriers are expected to operate very limited services in (the April-June quarter), with a gradual increase from (the July-September) quarter. Gulf airlines are also expected to pursue a calibrated return to the Indian market. With Europe and the US having become the epicentres of Covid-19, all carriers serving Westbound routes will be particularly impacted, especially as European and Gulf carriers rely significantly on US traffic to/from India,"" Capa said "

The survey result was presented by HMF trustee Kranti Rayamane and researcher Gopal Kulkarni.As per the findings, 38.3% women said they have experienced domestic violence at least once. Of this, 33.9% encountered physical violence, 24.1% faced emotional violence and 12.2% faced sexual violence.The survey defines emotional violence as being insulted or made to feel bad about oneself, being belittled in front of others or being intimidated for a purpose.Early marriage, low literacy, poor economic status, marginalised social status, substance addiction, polygamy and financial or health problems emerged as the key factors that were associated with domestic violence.

",Karnataka: Four out of six flights cancelled on day one of resumption of domestic flights to Mangaluru International Airport,"MANGALURU: It was not the kind of push back to domestic flying that airlines operating to Mangaluru International Airport (MIA) were looking for on Monday. On a day, the ministry of civil aviation permitted airlines to operate on the domestic sector, four out of six flights were cancelled. Flights were scheduled from Mumbai, Chennai, and Bengaluru as per the schedule that SpiceJet and IndiGo had submitted to the MIA authorities. Indigo flight 6E0279 was the first to touch down with 47 passengers at 6.45pm and returned to the state capital with 35 passengers at 7.30pm. Since 13 of the 47 passengers were ‘Corona Risk’ having travelled via Bengaluru from Delhi, Madurai, and Pune to reach Mangaluru, they were referred to compulsory 14-day quarantine including seven-day institutional quarantine. The other passengers were stamped and sent to home quarantine. While SpiceJet cancelled its flight SG1035 from Bengaluru that was scheduled to land at MIA at 10am, the airline also cancelled its flight SG0356 from Mumbai. IndiGo also announced its decision to cancel flight 6E5327 from Mumbai that was scheduled to land at 11am and return at 11.40am up to May 27. Other flight that IndiGo cancelled was Chennai flight 6E7141 that was scheduled to land at 7.35pm and depart at 8.05pm, V V Rao, APD, MIA, said. As per information given by MIA authorities, the only flights that operated for the day were IndiGo flight 6E0279 and SpiceJet flight SG3743, both from Bengaluru. As the current schedule stands, the first of the six arrivals will happen at 8.35am and last one at 9.15pm and the first of six departures will start at 9.05am and last one at 9.50am. The airport authorities followed all SOP laid down by the ministry to facilitate the domestic flights. Sources privy to the development noted that the SOP 3.0 released by the department of health for people entering the state – either by rail, road or air – that mandates 14-days of institutional and home quarantine was a major deterrent for those who wanted to fly to their respective destination. The SOP also lays the onus on business travellers to possess non-Covid19 positive certificate issued by an ICMR approved lab that is not more than 2-days old. "

The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) is sanitising those trays each time a passenger picks up his stuff after scanning. And, the same is been sanitised before the next passenger uses it to drop his or her belongings. “We have devised protocols to ensure the safety and security of our personnel, passengers and everyone else at the airport in keeping with the requirement of the Corona pandemic.

Frisking is also being done by a detector attached to a wand. “Our security protocol is uniform and standardised across the country,” Ganapathy said. CISF was prepared for a much larger number of passengers than those who turned up on day one. The large number of flight cancellations meant about half the number of passengers could actually take to the skies on Monday. The low numbers meant CISF could do a trial of its new protocols which went off smoothly. Now, travellers are hoping states also have uniform protocol for arriving passengers. "

""RPKs (revenue passenger kilometres) picked up in India (up by 8.4 per cent year-on-year) as local carriers boosted air travel demand by lowering airfares in the typically weak travel season,"" the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said in a statement. The IATA, which represents around 300 airlines accounting for 82 per cent of the global air traffic, measures passenger growth in terms of RPKs, which is calculated by multiplying the number of passengers with the distance travelled by them. Globally, RPKs contracted by 14.1 per cent year-on-year in February due to the coronavirus pandemic, the worst performance since the 9/11 terror attacks, the IATA said. "

After much persuasion, Mumbai airport agreed to allow only 50 flights on day one - less than a fourth of what India's second-busiest airport was to see.

Instead of the 8,216 schedule flights that ply in Indian skies per week (over 1,170 daily), the first few days starting Monday may see close to only half of that frequency at about 600.

While the Centre's guidelines for arriving domestic travellers require them to self-monitor their health for 14 days, states have been given a free hand to develop their own protocol for quarantine and isolation for incoming passengers.

","Now, Chhattisgarh & Maharashtra oppose restart of domestic flights"," NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: Two days before domestic airlines are set to resume flights, the Congress-led Chhattisgarh government has said the Centre should not open up the skies or the rail routes without putting in place effective standard operation procedures (SOPs). No commercial flight will take off or land in Mumbai airport owing to lockdown restrictions, a top Maharashtra official said. Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel wrote to civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri and rail minister Piyush Goyal demanding SOPs for passengers, a mandatory 14-day quarantine, and insisted that the state government must receive prior information, including contact details, of all passengers who choose to travel. Raising concerns over the resumption of flight services without any SOP, Baghel asserted that it should be made operational only with strict and effective guidelines. He also said it may not be possible to avert the further spread of coronavirus if domestic flight services are resumed at the time when there is a spike in corona positive cases in the country. A senior Maharashtra bureaucrat told TOI since the entire Mumbai Metropolitain Region as well as Pune and Aurangabad districts are in red zone, it will not be advisable to allow flights. ""We have informed MIAL, which control the Mumbai airport that, unless it finetunes airport operations... We will allow only emergency flights and on compassionate grounds only,'' the bureaucrat said. Earlier, Tamil Nadu said it didn't want domestic flights to resume during the lockdown which is on till May 31. "

",Hyderabad: Strap on your mask & get ready for take off,"HYDERABAD: In less than 24 hours from now, the Hyderabad airport will throw open its doors to domestic passengers — most of them part of the city’s migrant workforce — anxiously waiting to visit their families in other states. While aviation industry sources say that the metro routes — to Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and even Pune — are likely to see maximum rush, they add that the overall footfall will be low. Reasons: limited airline operations coupled with apprehension among travellers to travel in an aircraft. “Those flying in the initial days are primarily those who have been stranded in Hyderabad over the last two months and want to return home. They are either those who came here on work and got caught , orworkers, in IT and other sectors,” said a industry insider. Among them is Ashish Rai who is set to travel right on Day 1— May 25. “I haven’t seen my family for months now. So, the first opportunity I got, I booked my tickets,” Rai told STOI. According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s (DGCA) summer schedule, the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport will operate about 164 daily connections between May and August, as opposed to its usual domestic load of 480 flights. But given that a large section of travellers are still in the wait-and-watch mode — before they can book their tickets — tour operators in the city are yet to start work. On Saturday, most of them confirmed that they aren’t taking any bookings yet. “We will wait for a while before resuming bookings. We don’t want to get into a situation again where flights start getting cancelled and we have to refund fares to passengers. Also, not many are expected to travel for a while,” said Abdul Majid Faheen, chairman, Travel Agents Federation of India (Hyderabad chapter). Apart from health concerns many are also unsure about the numerous guidelines that passengers now have to follow while flying in and out of an airport. If some are unclear about the quarantine system — Telangana is yet to provide clarity — others are fretting over the Aarogya Setu app. “I am from Hyderabad. I am stuck in Indore from past two months. I don't have a smart phone. But, as per the airlines guidelines states that every passenger must carry and ""Arogya Setu App"". Any alternative way to board flight IDR-HYB?” tweeted VVS Ashish. "

","Lack of clarity where domestic flights allowed from Monday, that’s why we are taking bookings from June 1: GoAir","NEW DELHI: Amid the confusion over which all states are allowing domestic flights to resume from Monday and with what quarantine conditions for those flying in from other parts of the country, GoAir has said its decision not to take bookings immediately from Monday was due to lack of clarity on these issues. The Wadia Group low-cost carrier will resume flights, one-third of the originally approved summer schedule, from June 1. The airline has been taking bookings for flights from that date. So far, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have said they don’t want domestic flights to resume during lockdown that is on till May 31. West Bengal also reportedly wants flights to resume later due to the super cyclone impact. Places like Karnataka, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Assam, Kerala and Jammu and Kashmir and Chhattisgarh will be quarantining arriving domestic passengers. “GoAir awaits clarity on the readiness of the respective states and their airports with regard to acceptance of flights, or the conditions applicable to passengers entering the respective states. Without clarity on these conditions, GoAir does not wish to inconvenience its passengers by putting on sale flights immediately post May 25 which they may book, that will not be permitted to operate to the respective states or may have conditions for arriving passengers of which they may be unaware. On receiving clarity GoAir will open its site for bookings post May 25 upto May 31 as and when and where appropriate,” GoAir said in a statement. “GoAir has already been on sale for its entire network of flights commencing June 1… fully prepared and equipped to execute the Covid-specific health and safety procedures outlined by the DGCA for the India aviation industry. GoAir looks forward to welcoming its customers onboard very soon,” the airline said. "

",14-day quarantine for domestic flyers too in state: Kerala govt,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Those coming to the state by domestic flights will also have to undergo 14 days' quarantine as per the lockdown guidelines, the state government said on Friday. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, however, said people coming for business needs could be exempted from this. ""We cannot demand 14 days' quarantine for those coming for business meetings for a day or two. They will be given advisories on precautions they have to follow while in the state,"" he said. While announcing the resumption of flight operations in the domestic sector from May 25 on Thursday, Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri had indicated that the ministry was not in favour of quarantining passengers on short-haul flights. Health minister K K Shailaja said the state had so far been insisting on quarantine for all those coming from other states. ""How can a passenger coming by flight from Chennai be different from a person coming from the same place in a train or by road? We have to treat them the same way,"" she said. Can’t take any risk: MinisterThey are coming from red zones and we have to send them for the mandatory 14-day quarantine. We cannot take any risk in this matter. We are getting more cases now from those coming from other states, and those coming by domestic flights should follow the same procedures,"" she said. According to the state government decision, people coming by domestic flights will also be screened at airports like those coming from abroad. Asymptomatic persons will be allowed to undergo room quarantine in their homes while symptomatic passengers will be immediately shifted to hospitals. These passengers can also utilise the paid quarantine facility. Shailaja said the state could not let things go out of hand by not screening the domestic flyers. ""We won't be able to identify virus carriers in a flight. All passengers in a flight will come under the high-risk category if there is one carrier. We cannot allow them to move around in the community,'' she said. "

",Healthy elderly can fly; Aarogya Setu app not must for air travel: Hardeep Singh Puri,"NEW DELHI: The Centre iterated on Friday that domestic flights to all places would resume from Monday, despite resistance from Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, and termed as “impractical” calls for quarantining domestic flyers after they disembark. Aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri clarified the healthy elderly wouldn’t be stopped from flying. The use of Aarogya Setu App, he said, was preferable, and not mandatory, for air travel. Airlines started opening bookings from Thursday night after DGCA approved a schedule of 8,216 weekly domestic flights from Monday, a third of the original summer schedule of 24,643. While all airlines are taking bookings for travel from May 25, GoAir is doing so from its originally announced date of June 1. Till 5 pm on Friday, over 1 lakh tickets are learnt to have been sold, with almost 60,000 of them by market leader IndiGo alone. “Domestic passengers are pre-cleared. Some of the anxiety which is being shown would have been there at any time. Now we have been under lockdown for 57 days and are opening after three days. Between March 25 and June 1, what’s going to change? We are going ahead with this. And if some states feel anxiety (about allowing domestic flights) and quarantine people for some days, that is not practical. We would face the same issue even if we were to start on June 1,” Puri said. The places opposing domestic air travel from Monday are “accepting trains and the number of people coming by air is very small. I personally don’t see any problem (with everyone coming on board for domestic flights from Monday),” he added. “There’s tremendous pent-up demand, as is visible from the number of bookings made in a few hours. We are not sending passengers from abroad. Even those coming from abroad are doing so after taking all precautions, and then states have all quarantine facilities for them. Here we are bringing in (domestic) passengers who are making declarations when they do a web check-in. They have to tick boxes about things like not coming from a containment zone or not having tested Covid-positive in the last two months. Only if they fulfil these conditions are they given boarding cards,” Puri said. About restricting the very elderly from flying, the minister said: “The important thing is that this is an advisory applicable not just to the elderly but also to pregnant women and people with health issues. Initially only those who need to travel will travel. If you are aged and healthy and need to travel, you can travel. Similarly, the use of the Aarogya Setu App is also preferable, not mandatory, for travel. A healthy elderly person will not be stopped from travelling."" "

","Telangana, Andhra Pradesh travel agents welcome resumption of domestic flights","HYDERABAD: Welcoming the Centre's move to resume domestic flight operations, the Andhra Pradesh & Telangana Chapter of Travel Agents Association of India on Friday said it would take at least three months for the business to pick up. The Association Chairman Nagesh Pampati said the government needs to take measures to build up the confidence of people who want to travel and also educate all stakeholders about the dos and don'ts. ""This is a timely decision by the government. Because let's accept the fact that the virus is going to be there for a long time. The Travel and tourism industry will take some time to pick up momentum, though the government is taking several steps to build up the confidence of the industry,"" Nagesh told . On Thursday, the civil aviation ministry announced allowing about a third of domestic flight operations under strict norms from coming Monday after a two-month hiatus, mandating all the airlines to adhere to the upper and lower limits of fares prescribed by the government. ""It would take at least three months for the travel and tour industry to pick the momentum. That too it depends on various measures that the government is going to take,"" Nagesh said. According to him, about 40,000 people dependent on the tour and travel industry in both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are hit by the lockdown, which forced the industry to come to a standstill. Nagesh said hundreds of travel agents cancelled tickets due to the lockdown and refunded the amount to the passengers, though many agents are yet to receive full credit from the airlines. Vijay Reddy, an infrastructure developer and frequent traveller, said it is necessary to open air travel as further delay would hurt the aviation industry as well as other businesses. You cannot keep on traveling long journeys by bus or train. We should take precautions and at the same time try to bring normalcy,"" Reddy said. Balaji Travels, a local ticketing agent, said though the bookings are open, PNR (Passenger Name Record) numbers are not being issued by airlines. "

","After lockdown, Kolkata to take off with 40 flights","KOLKATA: Authorities at Kolkata airport have their work cut out. In the next four days, the terminal battered by cyclone Amphan has to be repaired and made fit to resume operations as domestic flights that had been grounded for two months take off again on Monday. Around 30-40 flights are expected to take off from Kolkata. The announcement that flight operations would resume came on a day the airport was being hammered by the cyclone. Domestic passenger flights will resume on Monday in a calibrated manner, said civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri. He hinted that the social distancing by keeping the middle passenger seat vacant was unlikely to be part of the SOP for airlines. While the SOP for both airlines and airport operators will be announced on Thursday, sources told TOI a 14-year-old security measure that prohibited passengers from carrying liquids beyond 100ml in the passenger cabin would be junked to enable flyers to carry sanitizer bottles to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus. “Passengers will be allowed to carry up to 350ml of sanitizer with 70% alcohol content. The security may use a chemical analysis machine that will detect traces of explosives to ensure safety,” the source said. However, passengers may not be initially allowed a cabin bag, the only exception being handbags for women and laptop carriers. The ban on carrying liquid was enforced in 2006 in airports worldwide after the liquid bomb plot to blow up transatlantic jets from Heathrow to North America was uncovered in the UK. While the airport had more than 200 domestic flights in operation when flights were grounded across India on March 24, services from the city are expected to resume with only a fifth or even fewer flights initially.

",In-laws can’t evict woman till they give an alternative: Court,"NEW DELHI: A woman fighting a case under the Domestic Violence (DV) Act cannot be evicted from a shared household by her husband and her in-laws, even if they own the property, till the time they provide her with alternative accommodation, the Delhi high court has said in a significant ruling. A bench of Justice Rekha Palli on December 18 allowed the appeals filed by six women challenging their eviction orders by the trial court, when they had a “residence order” in their favour under the DV Act. Setting aside their eviction decrees, the high court said that the trial courts must decide the matters afresh while ensuring the women’s right to shelter under the DV Act. It added that a civil court cannot render a woman without a roof as long as she continues to be in a matrimonial relationship. Daughter-in-law vs Sr citizens: HC strikes balanceMerely because the rights accrued to an aggrieved person under the DV Act are in the nature of special protection, and not proprietary, the trial court was not justified in passing a decree which, in effect, whittles away that protection,” Justice Palli noted. The HC interpreted sections of the Act to stress that this law ensures that “irrespective of the ownership of the premises, the aggrieved person would retain the right to reside therein as long as she is able to prove that she endured domestic violence while being in a domestic relationship with the owner of such premises”. Trying to strike a balance between the rights of senior citizens and their daughters-in-law, the court also empathised with the plight of in-laws “keeping in view their old age coupled with the medical problems faced by them”. Citing provisions of the Senior Citizens Act, it said the law was enacted to ensure that parents and senior citizens are not made to suffer by their children or forced to reside with estranged daughters-in-law in a property that stands exclusively in their names. At the same time, it pointed out that in incidents of domestic violence arising out of matrimonial disharmony, the right of residence under the DV Act “is a special step towards ensuring that a helpless wife and her children are not abandoned without any shelter, by categorically protecting their right to reside in the shared household, irrespective of whether the aggrieved wife or her spouse bears any title or interest in the said household”. The HC said the trial court must rely on the DV Act to ensure that irrespective of who owns the matrimonial home, a daughterin-law “would still retain the right to reside therein as long as she was able to prove that she had endured domestic violence while being in a relationship with the owner of such premises”.

",Delhi violence: Supreme Court refers to high court plea seeking lodging of FIRs against politicians for hate speech,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Delhi high court to hear on March 6 petitions filed by 10 people affected by the recent violence in the national capital. The affected people have sought registration of FIRs against politicians for alleged hate speeches. The apex court asked the chief justice of the high court to deal with the matter along with other connected intervention and impleadment pleas as expeditiously as possible. It also asked the high court to advance the date of other connected matters from April. A bench comprising chief justice S A Bobde and justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant said, ""The high court may explore the possibility of peaceful resolutions of the disputes."" However, the apex court kept to itself the allegations of hate speech against activist Harsh Mander. It asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to file a sworn affidavit on behalf of the Centre about the allegations against Mander. Mehta said he would file the affidavit in the post-lunch session with the apex court registry and serve the copy to the lawyer of Mander. Mander's lawyer, Karuna Nundy, denied that the activist made any such hate speeches as alleged by the Centre. At the outset, when the matter came up for hearing, the bench asked senior advocate Colin Gonsalves whether Mander had made any statements against the government and Parliament. At this point, Mehta said the activist did make serious and objectionable statements and referred a few of them. Advocate Nundy said she was representing Mander and Gonsalves also said he had earlier appeared for the activist but at present, he was appearing for the riot-affected people. During the hearing, the bench said along with the affidavit, the Centre will provide the transcripts of the alleged hate speech. Before commencing the hearing, the bench made it clear that it was not going to hear Mander's petition till it sorted out the allegations against him. After that, the bench went ahead with the hearing on the petition filed by 10 riot-affected people who have sought registration of FIR against BJP politicians Kapil Mishra, Parvesh Mishra, Abhay Verma and Anurag Thakur.

",Delhi riots: Residents stick together in island of peace,"NEW DELHI: Having borne the brunt of the riots, Phase-VII of Shiv Vihar has turned into a virtual ghost town. But Gali No. 14, in the middle of the colony, stands out as an exception. Some are calling it an island of peace, as stories emerge of how Hindus and Muslims risked their lives to save each other when the violence was at its peak. Most houses are largely untouched in this lane, thanks to this show of strength. Shiva Kumar (62), who guards the wooden log at the entry gate, said people from both communities joined hands to keep the rioters away. Different groups, with their own sets of slogans, descended on the colony on Monday night, Kumar recalled. “We saved our lives in this storm by begging, pleading and touching feet of these people,” he said. Residents said they prevented attacks by hiding the identities of the people from the different set of rioters. They said there were a few local participants too in the violence, but the mobs mostly comprised outsiders. Bhanvar Singh, a vegetable-seller, said Hindus and Muslims have lived together for over 30 years in the colony. “Not a single lock has been broken in our lane. We live in brotherhood. No one can hurt you if you stick together,” he said. While the rest of the colony is in ruins, Singh’s comments ring true when you look at Gali No. 14. Mohammad Aamir, another resident, said: “People helped each other out and that’s why our houses survived. People came in two trucks from the Loni side (to attack),” he said. Lal Devi added: “We lied and protected our identities. We are staying on to save our houses as well as that of our neighbours,” she said. Many people, however, have fled. “I don’t know where she (her neighbour) is now. When she was here, we used to laugh and cry together. But now there is only silence. I miss her,” Devi said. "

",Bihar: Families still hesitant to engage domestic workers,"PATNA: Domestic helps play an important role in many households in urban areas. But some of the residents in the city have prohibited their domestic helpers as they do not want to take any risk of getting infected by the coronavirus, though their workload has increased substantially. Most of such residents approached for comments said they are staying indoors and the need for a domestic help has increased more than ever. For 61-year-old Asha Devi, life without domestic help has become very difficult. “I had two helpers, one for cleaning and the other one for cooking food. Being a diabetic and arthritis patient, it’s impossible for me to move around and look after the household chores,” the Saguna Mor resident said. She added: “It’s true that people like me having underlying diseases are more vulnerable to getting infected by the virus. But there are other important things to be taken care of.” Kadamkuan resident Neha Shree, who recently started calling her maid, said: “Working from home with a three-year-old kid is next to impossible. My husband and me work from 10am to 8pm. At times it gets very difficult to do everything, from cooking and cleaning to looking after my son,” said Neha Shree of Kadamkuan. At residential colonies and housing societies, more than 50% of house helpers have resumed work. Abhay Nandan, secretary of Pataliputra Vikas Manch, said most residents have started calling their maids after the third phase of lockdown extension. “At least 50-60% houses have engaged their maids and servants again. We are also not stopping them as all sectors have got partial relief from the lockdown,” he said. He said most of the domestic helps had become jobless. “Residents helped them initially, but with the lockdown extensions, most of them stopped helping. At least two-three maids have asked me for work in the last few days as they find it difficult to meet their basic necessities,” Nandan said. Some others said people should not invite the virus to their homes. Usha Jha, president of Bihar Mahila Udyog Sangh, said: “This is a very critical situation for everyone. The government has also asked us to stay in a lockdown and maintain social distancing. Hence, I have stopped calling my house helper. Calling maids and servants at a time like this will not just risk my life but theirs too.” "

",A woman’s capability to earn not grounds to deny her maintenance: Delhi HC,"NEW DELHI: Broadening the welfare scope of the Domestic Violence Act, the Delhi high court has said the mere fact that a woman is capable of earning cannot be used as grounds to deny her maintenance. The HC held that in a case where a wife’s working status is disputed, the court cannot assume that because she is educated, or was employed prior to her marriage, she would again be gainfully employed. Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva noted that granting maintenance under the protective umbrella of the DV Act is not dependent upon the expression “unable to maintain herself”, as is found in CrPC Section 125 which also deals with maintenance. The HC specified that whether the wife was actually earning or was qualified and capable of earning were two different things, and set aside the order of a lower court withdrawing maintenance being paid to a woman by her estranged husband. The woman had challenged the court order denying her maintenance of Rs 16,500 per month on the grounds that she was duly qualified, educated and gainfully employed. According to the petition, the couple got married on February 14, 2015. Later, the wife alleged that she was harassed and subjected to cruelty by her in-laws who were dissatisfied with the dowry. The HC directed the husband to pay his wife Rs 16,500 per month as maintenance from the date of filing the maintenance application on May 3, 2017. The court also granted the husband four weeks to clear the entire maintenance arrears. It noted that under Section 20 of the DV Act, the magistrate has the power to direct the husband to pay monetary relief to meet the expenses incurred and losses suffered by the aggrieved person, and any child of the aggrieved person, as a result of domestic violence. It also observed that under Section 20(2) of the act, monetary relief granted has to be adequate, fair and reasonable, and consistent with the standard of living to which the aggrieved person was accustomed.

","Mumbai businessman held for letting 3 pals rape wife, filming act","MUMBAI: A 46-year-old city businessman was arrested on Tuesday after his 39-year-old wife accused him of indulging in “wife swapping” and allowing three of his friends to rape her on different occasions from 2017. He reportedly even filmed an act. On Wednesday, a magistrate court sent the man to police custody until December 23. The couple was married in 2003 and has two teenaged children. The woman has sought divorce from the accused and the custody of the children. She has also submitted a domestic violence complaint against the man. An FIR has been registered against the husband and the three friends. The woman alleged that when she confided in her father-in-law earlier this year, he too propositioned her. According to her, her husband had threatened to defame and kill her if she told anyone about the incidents. After falling chronically ill, she moved back to live with her mother in August. Subsequently, she filed the police complaint. She alleged the first incident took place on June 15, 2017. Husband brushed aside wife’s complaint of sex abuse by palAccording to the woman, the first time she was raped was on June 15, 2017, after her husband introduced her to a friend post-dinner. The friend is now a co-accused in the case. She said her husband physically forced her to sit in the front seat with the friend who was driving the car while he sat behind with that man’s wife. The man reportedly molested her, and when she complained, her husband said, “Kuch nahin hota (nothing happens).” She said her husband, too, was physically involved with the his friend’s wife in the back seat. After driving around, they went to a flat around 11.30pm, where her husband’s friend allegedly raped her while her husband was in the living room with that man’s wife. She said when she was allowed to leave the room, she complained to her husband. He took her home, assuring her that it would not happen again. They reportedly fought over the incident, following which he apologised to her. Recalling the second instance, the woman, represented by advocates Swapana Kode and Shruti Mundargi, said one night in October 2017, her husband took her to a flat where another couple was present. She said she was raped once again, and this time her husband threatened to kill her if she revealed about the incident to anyone. She alleged that two days later, her husband brought home another man, the fourth accused in the case, when her father-in-law and children were out. She alleged the man raped her in front of her husband. The following weekend, too, the man sexually assaulted her, which her husband recorded on his phone. She alleged she was similarly assaulted on two more occasions until February. Police are investigating the case. The accused have been booked under IPC sections for rape, assault and criminal intimidation.

",Domestic violence against women: MP tops the chart,"BHOPAL: It is not just outside, but if data is to be believed, Madhya Pradesh is the worst place for women, even indoors. The state has registered the highest number of cases under the Domestic Violence Act, as per NCRB figures released on October 21. A total of 616 cases were registered in the entire country in 2017 under the Domestic Violence Act, 2005. The Act is meant to provide more effective protection of the rights of women guaranteed under the Constitution. The women are victims of violence of any kind occurring within the family and for matters connected therewith. A whopping 39% of the 616 cases or a total of 241 cases of domestic violence were registered in Madhya Pradesh alone in 2017. And this was an increase of close to 200% as only 90 cases under the Domestic Violence Act were registered in the state in 2016. Madhya Pradesh was third after Bihar and Kerala, where 171 and 111 cases were respectively registered under the Act in year 2016. It is noteworthy that the state already has the dubious distinction of being the country's rape capital. A total of 5,562 cases of rape were registered in 2017, which is the highest in the entire country. Of these, 3,066 cases were of rape against minors and the state has topped in this too. In overall crime against women, Madhya Pradesh is on the fourth position in the country -- after Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal -- with a total of 29,788 cases registered for crime against women in year 2017. Crime against women saw an increase of around 12% in 2017 when 3,184 more cases were registered compared to year 2016. The number of incidents of rape, that have been reported in 2017, had seen a sharp increase of around 14%, compared to year 2016.

Imam has been booked under section 13 (unlawful activities) of the act in the case, said his counsel advocate Mishika Singh.  The police had earlier charged Imam with sedition, alleging his speech promoted enmity between people that led to riots. ""He was arrested in two cases of violence at Jamia on December 13 and 15, 2019, for instigating and abetting the Jamia riots, due to his seditious speech on December 13 and based on evidences collected, IPC sections 124 A and 153 A were also invoked,"" said Anil Mittal, additional PRO, Delhi Police.  In its supplementary charge sheet, the police had said serious riots had broken out in consequence of the protest march organised by Jamia students against the amended citizenship law on December 15 last year.  The mob indulged in large-scale rioting, stone-pelting and arson, and in the process destroyed several public and private properties while a number of police personnel and people were injured in the riots, the agency said in its final report filed before the chief metropolitan magistrate court.  The cases were registered at New Friends Colony and Jamia Nagar Police Stations. In the New Friends Colony case, Imam was arrested for instigating and abetting the Jamia riots, due to his seditious speech delivered on December 13, 2019.  ""During investigation, on the basis of evidence collected, sections 124 A (sedition) and 153 A IPC (promoting enmity between classes) were invoked in the case,"" a police officer said.  Imam was arrested from Bihar's Jehanabad on January 28.  He was involved in organising protests at Shaheen Bagh but came into limelight after a video showed him making controversial comments before a gathering at Aligarh Muslim University, following which he was booked under sedition charges.  The Delhi Police had also booked him for an ""inflammatory"" speech delivered on the Jamia campus.  Another case was filed against Imam in Assam under the stringent anti-terror law for his remark that Assam could be ""severed from India, even if for a few months"" as a result of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

",RWAs in a dilemma as many residents want gates opened for help,"NEW DELHI: While a growing number of people want their domestic workers to resume services and relieve them of cooking and cleaning chores, many others are still apprehensive about allowing outsiders into their homes. The RWAs vacillated between these two demands on Tuesday, the second day of loosening of curbs on the movement of domestic services providers like domestic help, plumbers and electricians. The latter too were in a similar quandary. The RWA of Pocket 40 in Chittaranjan Park had barred the entry of the home services people, but many residents defied the norms. RWA president R R Anand said, “On Monday, there were arguments about why we were stopping what the state had allowed. So, the association was forced to allow entry from Tuesday morning.” Entry of domestic staff a tough call for RWAsMany RWAs have opened the colony gates for domestic service providers, though with conditions and precautions. Sarvodaya Enclave, for instance, is issuing entry passes to such people after collecting personal documents to facilitate contact tracing in case they later test positive. Shafali Mittal, general secretary, Sarvodaya Enclave RWA, revealed, “The residents have given an undertaking to be responsible for sanitisation and anti-Covid protective measures. The RWA is allowing authorised people into the colony after checking their body temperature and checking addresses to see they are not from containment zones.” Many RWAs aren’t quite so open to the idea. Chetan Sharma of S Block RWA in Greater Kailash II, said, “We have decided not to allow in anyone till May 17. Our selfhelp groups will assist the elderly who require help,” he said, adding that this precaution was necessary since much of the area’s workforce lived in Sangam Vihar, Tughlaqabad and Dakshinpuri, all of which have containment zones. Rajiv Kakria of GK1 RWA elaborated on another aspect of lifting the restriction. “The surfaces touched by individual service providers like plumbers and electricians can be sanitised. But with home workers and cooks who serve in multiple homes, this will not be possible,” he said. There is some unhappiness about the Delhi government putting the onus of letting in service people on the RWAs. Ritesh Dewan, member of Shalimar Bagh RWA and general secretary of Delhi Residents’ Forum, was emphatic that the associations were not equipped to make such decisions and this would only cause infighting. Harjinder Saroha, vicechairman of Vasant Kunj Federation, similarly expressed a dilemma over giving entry to workers from corona-dense areas such as Rangpuri Pahari and Arjun camp. “It is still too risky, we have no option but to allow service providers only for elderly people on compassionate grounds,” he added. While the RWAs were perplexed on managing the situation, many domestic workers gave work a miss on Tuesday. “I did not respond to my employer’s summons,” said plumber Kamal Kant of Varinder Nagar in west Delhi. “I know that I can lose my job, but I cannot afford to pass on the virus to my family should I catch it while at work.” Kamalkant, who made around Rs 9,000 a month earlier, has exhausted his savings, but has decided the bigger evil is to risk infection. Like him, electrician Saqib Khan of south Delhi’s Khirki Extension also skipped work. “Fellow workers who reported for work on Monday told me there was very little work. So they too didn’t go back today. Why take a risk when there aren’t many who require our services?” he said. "

Police deployment was also stepped up in the areas named in the rumours to avoid any flare-ups. Earlier, at 7.53pm, Delhi Metro tweeted that the entry and exit gates of the Tilak Nagar stations had been closed. Half an hour later, it announced that six other stations — Nangloi, Surajmal Stadium, Badarpur, Tughlakabad, Uttam Nagar west and Nawadahad been shut. At 8.40pm, DMRC announced that all stations had been opened. Sources said that police suspected a conspiracy behind such large-scale rumormongering, which they said had taken place in a “coordinated manner”. The cyber cell has started a thorough probe. Several twitter handles had been identified for spreading fake news of clashes, an officer said. In south-east Delhi, police received multiple calls of clashes and riots as people from Madanpur Khadar and Okhla called up the control room seeking help and informing them about “violence”. In the Khadar area, police are probing if a mild commotion about some thief being caught at a shop led to locals spreading news. In no time, rumours had started about “stonepelting” in Baljeet Nagar, Patel Nagar and Karol Bagh, etc. In Khayala, police said there was some commotion as local cops had caught some gamblers indulging in satta (illegal betting). Sources said that when caught, the accused apparently tried to escape screaming “riot”, which led to a commotion. In Mangolpuri, local police carried out flag march and went around telling people to not fall for rumours. By 8pm, WhatsApp groups of RWAs across the city were abuzz with people forwarding messages of “riots” breaking out in their areas.

","Farmers, students’ bodies block rail traffic to protest against Delhi violence","BARNALA: Members of 14 farmer, farm labourer, youth and students unions disrupted railway traffic on the Bathinda-Ambala section in Ambala to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Delhi violence. The activists, including women, sat on the railway tracks and demanded rollback of CAA, scrapping of NPR and NRC and compensation for families of those killed in the Delhi violence. They urged the Union government to book Union minister Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Kapil Mishra of the BJP and ensure stern action against those responsible for the violence. They also held peace marches in many districts across Punjab. A passenger train had to be halted at Tapa, nearly 15 kilometres away from Barnala on the Bathinda section for 50 minutes and two goods trains were also stopped due to the protest. Sensing trouble at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi following the imposition of Section 144 of the CrPC and call by a few Hindu organisations to assemble there, activists decided to stage a sit-in on railway tracks near SSD College, Barnala. Heavy police force was deployed at the site. “The Union government is trying to divide the country on religious lines. Members of Muslim and Hindu communities have been killed in Delhi, posing a grave threat to communal harmony and secularism in the country. We want those inciting people to indulge in killings to be be given exemplary punishment,” farmer organisation BKU (Ekta Uhgrahan) vice-president Jhanda Singh Jethuke said. According to him, a massive protest against CAA, NPR and NRC will be organised at Malerkotla town of Sangrur district on March 8. Even though Ambala divisional railway manager (DRM) G M Singh said a passenger and two goods trains had to be halted due to the blockade, Barnala SSP Sandeep Goyal said farmers disrupted railway traffic for some time and no action was taken against them as movement of trains was not disrupted.

Issuing a statement, CBSE secretary Anurag Tripathi said, “CBSE will hold the examinations of both classes X and XII in the northeast district of Delhi from March 2 as per the schedule given in the date sheet. At the same time, considering the difficult situation that continues with some of the candidates, CBSE is prepared to hold examinations at a later date for such candidates who would not be able to appear for the examinations up to March 7. The school principals have been requested to provide the list of such students to the board. DoE has also been requested by CBSE to provide a list.” The examination will be held amid security in and around the centres. The board said it has decided to go on with the examinations so that it does not hamper the chances of admissions in professional courses i.e. medical, engineering, law and other UG admissions. “Few entrance examinations are conducted in accordance with the timelines fixed by the courts and therefore, dates are sacrosanct. Similarly, JEE (Main) is also scheduled from April 3 to 19. The board is also clear that for candidates who are in a position to appear for the board examinations, it would be very stressful and cause immense anxiety if the examinations are further postponed. As per our ongoing consultations with Delhi Police, the exams can be held smoothly and safely now for those students who are in a position to appear for them,” said Tripathi. "

With weeks to go for her wedding, her father, Roop Singh, used up all his savings to buy jewellery. A caretaker with DRP Convent School in Shiv Vihar — one of the many that were targeted during the violence in northeast Delhi — Singh suddenly finds his life in tatters. “Our samdhis (to-be in-laws) were insistent on getting everything done before Holi. But I told them that exams would be under way in our school and I would need to be extra vigilant at my job. We would have fixed a date after Holi, but now it has been postponed indefinitely,” Singh said. “Our belongings have been reduced to ashes and all the money and jewellery have gone,” Singh said, his hands covered in soot. Megha is still in shock. A family of five, Singh — three daughters, husband and wife — used to live on the top floor of the school that has now been charred beyond recognition. The rooms are burnt and the remains of furniture thrown into the compound. “Around 2.45pm on Monday, when tension started to escalate, the school sent the children home. We locked the gates from inside,” he recalled. Megha saw the arsonists climbing down into the compound using ropes from the adjacent building. The lock was broken and, soon after, it was mayhem. “I was eating at that time. Megha came running to us and told us to run,” Singh said. “We jumped from a height of nearly 14 feet. It was a matter of life and death,” he added. When a semblance of normacly was restored, the family returned to find that nothing of their belongings remained. “My wife, Geeta, and our daughters are now staying at a friend’s place in Govind Vihar. I have nothing now. Even the clothes I am wearing are borrowed,” Singh said. Singh alleged that every time he called the police, he was told that a team was on its way. But nobody came, he said. “The rioters had a free run for two days,” he remarked. “Now, the ladke wale are saying that the wedding can’t take place in such an atmosphere.

This includes basic health check-up for maids and drivers, thermal scanners to test their temperature and providing them masks. However, RWAs in Greater Kailash I and II accused the government of passing the buck. They said the government knows the gravity of the situation, but was still making announcements that would lead to arguments and confusion. They are planning to allow domestic helps only in case of emergency or for senior citizens. Ruby Makhija, a member of Navjivan Vihar RWA, said at least 25 associations jointly pursued Delhi government on Saturday to get clarity on the matter. “We can’t force a decision on residents unless there is a clear-cut order. The announcement by the Centre is like passing the buck. How can we find out if these workers are infected and stop them from visiting houses?” she asked. The Jangpura Extension RWA has requested residents to avoid calling maids and servants for another week. Kapil Kakkar, RWA president, said, “We are making arrangements for checking flu and respiratory symptoms of maids. There were plans of conducting basic tests, but that didn’t materialise. We want to ensure that those visiting multiple places don’t become carriers of infection. The local police should help implement these directions.” The president of GK S-Block RWA, MK Gupta, said, “There are around 400 maids who come to the area daily. Most of them visit multiple houses. It will be difficult to check them regularly. Senior citizens and the unwell can call the maids, but only from gate 2 where mask will be given, thermal screening will be done and their hands will be sanitised. Residents will have to ensure that maids don’t roam around and sit in parks and leave the colony immediately after doing the work.” Many RWAs argued that they can’t force residents to accept their decision, especially when they are non-members. “In case something goes wrong, we will be blamed. If the government makes the situation conducive and ensures zero movement from containment zones, then restrictions can be eased. It’s better to wait till May 10,” said Rajeev Kakria of E-Block RWA, GK-I. "

Police have invoked the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), apart from IPC sections on criminal conspiracy and sedition. Jamia Millia Islamia students Meeran Haidar and Safoora Zargar were first arrested by northeast district police and then by Special Cell through this FIR. Seven others, including activists like Gulfisha and Khalid Saifi, have been arrested in this case taking the number of accused to nine. Six of the nine accused, including Haidar and Zargar, are now booked under UAPA. They have also been booked for sedition and promoting enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion and rioting. Former Jawaharlal Nehru University student Umar Khalid, who is already facing trial for sedition in the Afzal Guru commemoration event of 2016, is also under probe in this FIR for his hate speeches given against Citizenship Amendment Act, a senior officer said. Haider and Zargar, who are members of Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC), are in judicial custody. While Haider is a PhD student and president of RJD youth wing’s in Delhi, Zargar is an MPhil student at Jamia and the media coordinator of JCC. The communal riots, which broke out on February 23, led to the deaths of over 50 people. Police in northeast district have filed close to 750 FIRs in connection with the riots and have arrested many on charges of murder and attempted murder. The cases are now being probed by the Crime Branch. The Special Cell’s FIR has been lodged on a tip-off from intelligence agencies and inputs obtained by the special branch. The case has been lodged on the statement of a Special Cell sleuth saying that the communal violence was fallout of a “premeditated conspiracy”. A probe is on in Khalid’s two extremely provocative speeches in which he allegedly appealed to people to block the roads during the visit of US President Donald Trump to make treatment of minorities in India an international issue. According to the latest FIR, the accused were assigned responsibilities to congregate people from different areas and make women and children block the roads under Jafrabad metro station to fuel tension in the area. This was something that reportedly triggered the riots. The FIR also focuses on the preparations for the riots that saw massive use of firearms, Molotov cocktails, acid bottles, bricks and stones. All these things were collected inside numerous homes and on terraces over a period of time. "

A lot of them are reported during the evening hours when the men tend to drink and then have fights with their wives,” said Kundu. Other officials concurred that in many cases, these cases are related to dowry or divorce. As far as the ‘unspecific allegations’ are concerned, Kundu said that sometimes women call for things like delay in their salaries or differences at work. No complaints are registered in such cases. However, these numbers do not fully depict the prevailing situation as many women have complained that they cannot reach the helpline number in the time of need. TOI had earlier reported that the helpline number wasn’t often reachable. In other cases, where the call does go through, the cops often are not sensitized enough to handle the situation says Prabhloch Singh who runs Human Rights Protection Group and MFP Protection. Singh says that he has worked with many women victims who were cross-questioned when they called the helpline for some help. “These 6,500 calls that they are calling unspecific are the calls when a woman is being stared at outside a college or misbehaved with near a mall and instead of sending help, cops often start questioning the victim instead,” said Singh. He added that there is a need for the cops especially those at the women helpline number to be trained so that they are empathetic to the women calling for help. "

",Some 100 people arrested a day in London for domestic violence during coronavirus lockdown,"LONDON: In the six weeks up to April 19, officers across London had made 4,093 arrests for domestic abuse offences - nearly 100 a day on average - and domestic abuse calls have risen by around a third in the last six weeks, Xinhua news agency reported citing data from the London Metropolitan Police. Charges and cautions have increased by 24 per cent since March 9, when people with Covid-19 symptoms were asked to self-isolate, compared to last year, said Commander Sue Williams, the Department's lead for safeguarding. Domestic incidents, which can include family rows not recorded as crimes, have seen a 3 per cent increase since last year, and jumped by 9 per cent between March 9 and April 19, the police said. There have been two domestic-related murders recorded in London as police continue to warn of an increased risk of abuse during the strict measures in place, said the Scotland Yard, metonym for the headquarters of the Met Police. ""The Covid-19 restrictions and 'stay at home' instruction is vital to managing this public health crisis, but unfortunately it has also left current and potential victims of domestic abuse even more vulnerable and isolated,"" said Williams. The Met Police gave examples of some of the cases it has dealt with in recent weeks, including one in which police discovered that a man reported by a victim was linked to firearms. ""Officers located him within three hours of receiving the report and searched his vehicle, finding two sawn-off shotguns. A cannabis factory was also discovered. The man was subsequently charged and is awaiting trial,"" said the Scotland Yard in a statement. Officers were also called to help a pregnant victim in east London, who had gone to a hospital to seek refuge after her partner assaulted and tormented her. Police said he was quickly arrested, but she was unwilling to support criminal action. However, due to the evidence captured on body worn video, and witness accounts from staff at the hospital, the Crown Prosecution Service supported a victimless prosecution, and the suspect is awaiting trial, the police further stated. ""Victims should be assured that they can leave their homes to escape harm or seek help, and they will not be penalized in any way for not maintaining social distancing, or otherwise breaching Covid-19 restrictions,"" Williams added. Globally, nearly 3 million people have been diagnosed with the deadly virus, with a tally of 206,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. "

",Jurisdiction not a barrier to save lives: Ghaziabad police rescue Delhiites,"GHAZIABAD: Many residents of riot-hit areas of the national capital are showing more faith in Ghaziabad cops than Delhi Police. Though no violence has been reported in Ghaziabad, officials said the police helpline here received at least 50 calls from distressed residents of northeast Delhi since Tuesday, which prompted cops to step out of their jurisdiction to rescue people and shift them to their friends’ or relatives’ houses in Loni. While the district administration claimed that almost 480 families from Delhi had moved to Ghaziabad since the riots broke out in the national capital, sources said some 300 families are currently staying with their friends or relatives in Loni and the rest have relocated to other cities. One of them is Aseem, a resident of Delhi’s Karawal Nagar who had called up Ghaziabad’s 112 after rioters allegedly set on fire his automobile workshop on Tuesday night. “My house is in Prem Vihar Colony in Karawal Nagar and several Hindu families live in the vicinity. Around 11pm on Tuesday, some people set afire my shop and subsequently gathered outside my house and destroyed my bike as well. Before leaving, they shouted that next night would be our last,” he said. Aseem initially sought help from a friend. “But he refused to help. Next day, as soon as I came to know that Ghaziabad police are deployed at the border and evacuating residents of riot-hit areas, I wasted no time and called up 112. Soon, a sub-inspector with some constables arrived in a vehicle and escorted us out,” he said. The Ghaziabad police team dropped Aseem, his wife and their two daughters in their relative’s place in Loni. “I have decided to leave Delhi-NCR and will soon shift to my native place in Lucknow,” he said. Another 46-year-old woman, Shamshira, had also sought help from the Ghaziabad police to move out of Delhi to her relative’s house in Loni, along with her goats. “My house and grocery shop were burnt down by some people on Tuesday night. The perpetrators had even threatened to kill me if I didn’t vacate the place by Wednesday. But Ghaziabad cops saved me and my goats, they are God to me,” she added. Md Yasin, a mechanic, said that in the riots, he lost his friend named Mehtab. “He was an auto-driver and we were friends for the past three years. Soon after coming to know about his death, I left my house and shifted to my parents-in-law’s place in Loni,” he added. When contacted, Ajay Shankar Pandey, the district magistrate of Ghaziabad, said that “we are rescuing people from nearby areas such as Karawal Nagar in Delhi”. “We have decided that if police or administration receives any call from that riot-hit area, we will help the callers. We can’t close our eyes like Delhi Police. Not a single cop from Delhi is present at the border. Delhi people are showing trust in us more than their local police,” he said. "

Though he had not been arrested till late on Thursday, the police raided his house and sealed his factory in northeast Delhi. His call records and mobile activity are being scanned to ascertain the identity of the people he was in touch with. Hussain has denied the allegation and claimed he is being framed. AAP has suspended him from the party’s primary membership and will wait for the outcome of the police probe, said sources. CM Arvind Kejriwal has said whoever is found guilty, irrespective of political affiliations, should be punished. The initial autopsy suggests over 200 injuries, including deep stab wounds, on Sharma’s body. Was trying to stop rioters: TahirThe initial autopsy of IB official Ankit Sharma suggests over 200 injuries, including deep stab wounds, on Sharma’s body, apart from blunt force impact (assault), indicating that he was tortured and then killed before his mutilated body was dumped in the drain. The SIT is studying the entire sequence of events, from the point where the family has alleged that he was kidnapped along with two others on Tuesday evening. While Sharma’s body was found in a drain near his house, two bodies were fished out together from a drain in a nearby area on Thursday. The police are trying to figure out if these deaths are connected. The police said they were studying all videos which have been submitted to them showing bottle bombs and heavy stone-pelting from a building owned by Hussain. In videos shot by local residents, over a hundred people can be seen gathered on the terrace of the building and engaging in violence. The building has been searched and some seizures made. A stash of Molotov cocktails, acid pouches, stones and a slingshot was recovered from his house on Thursday. Speaking in a video message which he claimed to have recorded on the day of the incident on the terrace of his Mustafabad house, Hussain claimed that he had informed the area SHO and senior police officers about the violence in his neighbourhood. The police are probing if the video is morphed and edited as the background, they said, keeps changing. “We are probing when the video was shot and from which device,” said a senior police officer. Hussain has claimed that the video in which he was seen on the terrace of his house wearing a red half-sleeve sweater, along with a group of youth, was shot on February 25 when he was trying to stop the youths from stone-pelting. He claimed that the men had entered his house after he and his family had been evacuated by the police the previous day and he had to return to dissuade them. “A mob of 100-150 had tried to break into my house and go up to the terrace on February 24 after which I had called the police. At first, the area SHO and ACP didn’t respond, but later a large force had arrived and rescued my family members around 8pm. The cops also checked my house and there was nothing on the terrace then,” he said. He claimed that his house was taken over by miscreants when he left that night. “The building stayed under the supervision of the police for the entire day and night, but for some reason, the force was removed and the rioters got on top of the building. I had even informed the police that I was afraid this might happen,” he said. Explaining why he was seen on the terrace the next day, he claimed he had learnt that the miscreants had broken into his house and had gone to the terrace and he had to return. He said senior party leaders were informed about it as well. “I didn’t have any other clothes with me when I left home and, hence, I was wearing the same red sweater seen in the video for the past two days,” he claimed. “Whatever has happened is very wrong and I am very sad. You must know that I am a truthful and honest Muslim and I have always worked for Hindu-Muslim brotherhood and will continue to do so. Rumours are being spread about me. I can never harm anybody. I had to escape with my family, fearing for our lives. I want to appeal to all of you to please have faith in me and trust me. I promise in the name of my children that I have not done this kind of thing,” he claimed in the video statement. "

",Justice S Muralidhar’s transfer routine: Central government,"NEW DELHI: The central government on Thursday strongly defended notification of Justice S Muralidhar’s transfer from Delhi high court to Punjab and Haryana high court, and criticised the opposition for “politicising” a routine transfer recommended by the Supreme Court collegium. “Transfer of Justice Muralidhar was done pursuant to the recommendation dated February 12 of the Supreme Court collegium headed by the Chief Justice of India. While transferring the judge, consent of the judge is taken. The well-settled process has been followed,” Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said. “By politicising a routine transfer, Congress has yet again displayed its scant regard for the judiciary,” he added. The notification of Justice Muralidhar’s transfer to Punjab and Haryana high court came late on Wednesday evening, interestingly on a day when he had taken up the matter of communal riots in Delhi for adjudication and sharply pulled up Delhi Police for inaction and failure to register FIRs against politicians for hate speeches. Congress linked Justice Muralidhar’s transfer to his strictures against Delhi Police and alleged that it had exposed “intimidation and vendetta politics” of the BJP government. Congress’s Rahul Gandhi also invoked Mumbai judge B H Loya whose death while hearing the Sohrabuddin encounter case triggered a controversy. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi tweeted, “The midnight transfer of Justice Muralidhar isn’t shocking given the current dispensation, but it is certainly sad and shameful.” Rahul tweeted, “Remembering the brave judge Loya, who wasn’t transferred.” Justice Muralidhar’s bench had pulled up Delhi Police over its failure to register FIRs for alleged hate speeches by BJP’s Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Kapil Mishra. It had expressed “anguish” and asked the police commissioner to take a “conscious decision” on it by Thursday observing “we do not want the city to witness another 1984 riots”. Justice Muralidhar, being the senior-most judge available on Tuesday night, had also conducted a late night hearing at his residence to ensure victims in a hospital in northeast Delhi got safe passage and treatment in better hospitals. He had asked the police to escort ambulances and ferry them to Delhi government hospitals. Along with Justice Muralidhar, the government also notified the transfer of two other high court judges recommended by the collegium — Justice Ranjit Vasantrao More from Bombay HC to Meghalaya HC and Justice Ravi Vijaykumar Malimath from Karnataka HC to Uttarakhand HC. The President also accepted the resignation of Justice Dharmadhikari of Bombay high court. He had resigned on February 15. Prasad also reacted on Rahul’s Loya jibe and said the Loya judgment had been settled by SC and those raising questions did not respect the judgment of the Supreme Court. "

Reminding journalists of their “special” responsibility, PCI said, “Their writings are not a mere reflection of their own feelings but help to large extent in moulding the feelings and sentiments of the society at large. It is therefore, of utmost importance that they use their pen with circumspection and restraint.” Also on Thursday, a delegation of journalists represented by the Press Club of India, Indian Women’s Press Corps and the Press Association called on Union I&B minister Prakash Javadekar and sought his cooperation and intervention in containing the growing atrocities on mediapersons while discharging their duties, particularly as witnessed during the ongoing violence in Delhi. Javadekar agreed that it is important that media is permitted to do its work in an atmosphere conducive to accurate and in-depth reporting no matter and assured the delegation that he will take up the issue with the concerned authorities to ensure safety and security of journalists. The delegation highlighted the brutal and rough treatment unleashed by the police in the recent rioting in north-east Delhi where journalists were shot at, heckled and even attacked by batons and rods and the police was found wanting in rendering assistance.

","Delhi riots: Ensure no one is denied treatment, say activists","NEW DELHI: Public health groups have issued a statement expressing concern over the manner in which access to healthcare, including emergency medical treatment to the injured, was not being provided in the context of communal violence in Delhi. Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and Medico Friends Circle in a statement said the police must not be allowed to stop patients and ambulances carrying them, doctors and drugs and medical supplies to any health facility. “Delays in this regard are absolutely unacceptable and are a violation of the fundamental rights of all people. It can have serious consequences,” said the statement. Public health activists said it was deplorable that a midnight intervention by Delhi high court was necessary to address the situation at Al Hind hospital in Mustafabad, which had been cordoned off by the police and ambulances, patients and medical supplies were not allowed to reach the hospital for several hours. They pointed out that the hospital was providing treatment to persons injured in the violence over the past two days. “The right to life is paramount and absolute, and all the state agencies, including medical professionals and the police have a constitutional obligation to ensure the preservation of the right,” said the statement, adding that the right to health is a fundamental human right and the state of Delhi ought to refrain from interfering directly or indirectly with the enjoyment of this right. The public health groups have demanded the police and the state to ensure medical personnel were not only not prevented, but also protected in fulfilling their duties in providing healthcare and saving lives.

","Delhi violence: At hospitals, some look for cure, others closure","NEW DELHI: “When we heard the mob attacking the houses nearby, we hid the men in our family under clothes and inside a cupboard. But the rioters barged in and dragged my brother out though he kept pleading, ‘Main aapka bhai hoon’. After two days of searching for him, we finally came to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital where we located his body,” wept Farheen, sister of Mohammed Musharraf. Farheen’s household is tragically fortunate to have found Chand Bagh resident Musharraf’s body on Thursday morning. There are many families that are still to locate loved ones missing since violence broke out in northeast Delhi on Sunday and for them there is no sense of closure yet. As more bodies are being found in the smouldering debris of the communal frenzy, the toll climbed to 38 on Thursday. Between big sobs, Farheen narrated, “We were actually preparing to leave the area at the first opportune time, but even as we prepared to go, a mob attacked our neighbourhood. Ours was among the first houses to be attacked. Hindu families occupied the first two floors and the horde skipped them while rushing to our second floor house. I had hidden my husband under a pile of clothes and my brother inside a cupboard. My husband had a miraculous escape, but my brother was discovered, dragged out and beaten in the road before being pushed into a car and taken away. We cried for help but it was all futile.” When the situation calmed down a bit, the family ventured out to trace the 35-year-old Musharraf. “We went to many places. Then an acquaintance of Musharraf informed us of hearing that he had been thrown into the Chand Bagh drain. We went there but didn’t find anything. Today morning, we came to GTB Hospital and finally found him — dead,” Farheen said. Waris Ali Khan had also been searching for his nephew, Mohseen, 24, since Tuesday. “Mohseen owns a generator shop in Noida. Around 5pm that day, he had returned home to Bhajanpura, where he also had to meet someone for a work-related appointment,” Khan said. “Near the temple, a mob surrounded his car and heckled him. He managed to call a friend who was on speed dial on his phone, but before anyone could rush to his aid, the rabble thrashed him and threw him into a drain. His body must have been fished out and brought to GTB Hospital.” Rajiv Saini, a resident of Brahmpuri, was lying on the floor at the hospital awaiting news of the condition of his brother, Naresh, 32. “He is lying in the ICU for the last three days. He was shot in the chest outside our house. He has a five-year-old daughter and a three-year-old son,” Saini mumbled. Waiting for the post-mortem of his sibling to be carried out, Muzammil Khan described Tuesday as the worst day of their life for the family. “We live in Kabir Nagar,” Muzammil said. “When things quietened down after the violence, my brother Mudassir went out to buy food. He never returned. He was shot in his head. His wife and six daughters are left without a bread winner.” GTB hospital director Dr Sunil Kumar said 215 riot victims had been treated there since Monday. “However, at the moment, only 51 patients are receiving treatment in the various departments. The rest have been discharged,” he said. Dr Kumar added that only one of the admitted patients is in a critical state. “In all, we have confirmed 33 deaths. Of these, 22 were already dead when brought to the hospital, while nine died after admission,” the hospital director said. Also at the hospital were those recovering from the murderous attacks. Ashfaq, one of them, said, “I was hit by a rod when trying to save my brother from the mob. Thank God, I am not dead like so many others in my neighbourhood. I think we will shift back to our hometown of Patna.” In Video:Delhi violence: CM Kejriwal visits GTB Hospital, appeals for peace"

",How police managed to wrest back control over law and order in northeast Delhi,"NEW DELHI: Till Tuesday afternoon, there were no signs that the violence in northeast Delhi would come to an end any time soon. Police had evidently failed in stopping the rioters from wreaking havoc and the morale of the force seemed to have hit rock bottom with severe criticism coming from all sides. However, Delhi Police bounced back and regained control of the law and order situation in less than 24 hours. While National Security Advisor Ajit Doval was tasked to ensure that peace returns to the region, special DG (CRPF) SN Shrivastava was given the order to join as the law and order chief immediately. The fresh guard remained on the ground for over 20 hours to fulfil the purpose. Police patrolling in northeast Delhi after communal riots on February 27The first step was a coordinated and adequate deployment. Three special commissioners, six joint commissioners, an additional commissioner, 22 DCPs, 20 ACPs, 60 inspectors, 1,200 male and 200 women personnel and 60 companies of outside forces were stationed at crucial locations. Union home minister Amit Shah reviewed the situation every two hours. Delhi violence: Live updatesIn the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, the changed attitude of police was clearly visible. The policemen were proactive in dispersing fresh gatherings, which were being attempted by different groups claiming to be protesting against Citizenship Amendment Act. Nearly 7,000 central paramilitary forces were deployed in the affected areas of northeast district since February 24.One such group assembled at Khureji and refused to budge on Wednesday noon, but police were quick to use force and move them away. Six of the organisers, including Khalid and Ishrat Jahan, were arrested for allegedly mobilising the crowd and blocking the road. Nearly 7,000 central paramilitary forces were deployed in the affected areas of Northeast district since February 24. As violence stopped, police on Wednesday started holding peace committee meetings to normalise the situation and improve inter-community harmony. In the last two days, nearly 330 such meetings were organised in various districts and they would continue till the situation normalises. East Delhi Municipal Corporation initiated steps to clean the streets and repair damaged public properties in riot-affected areas. Two helplines — 22829334 and 22829335 — were set up for round-the-clock assistance. “Apart from this, meetings with residents’ welfare associations and market welfare associations were also convened in several areas. They were attended by different sections of the society, including civil society groups and representatives of Congress, BJP, AAP and other political parties,” an MHA official said. The home ministry has requested citizens to not lay credence to any rumour. Shah appealed to citizens not to “fall prey to evil designs of miscreants and groups interested in precipitating communal tension”. “Only 12 police stations out of 203 in Delhi (about 4.2% of the geographical area) have been affected by the riots. Normalcy and communal harmony has prevailed elsewhere in the capital. Delhi Police is mandated and obligated to provide security to all sections of society, irrespective of caste and religion,” MHA said.

","Northeast Delhi violence: Petrol bombs, stones and bricks seen on terrace of his building","NEW DELHI: In the maze of the Chand Bagh neighbourhood, a four-storey building belonging to AAP councillor Tahir Hussain stands out — it’s the tallest structure there. In the past three days, however, it has also become the most talked about since the family of the IB official, Ankit Sharma, whose body was found in a drain, has alleged Hussain’s hand in his death. Several locals have alleged that rioters had used it to carry out attacks in the communal violence that rocked north-east Delhi. A video showing several hundred people throwing stones and petrol bombs from atop the building had gone viral on social media. When TOI visited the site on Thursday, cops were stationed outside the building but journalists were being let in. While several locals confirmed that the building belonged to Hussain, they said it wasn’t his residence. His house, in fact, is situated just behind the building. Hussain, 43, represents Nehru Vihar (Ward No 59) under the east corporation. He was elected in 2017 and, according to his affidavit, he does not have any criminal cases against him. He belongs to UP but has been living in Delhi for over 25 years and has a business of interior designing. On the terrace, one spotted a stockpile of petrol bombs and sharp pieces of stones kept in sacks that could have inflicted serious damage if dropped on people from that height. There were at least three crates, two of them empty, while one had petrol bombs made from cold drink bottles. Piles of rubble with pieces of bricks and cement were scattered on the terrace. The building was completely bare and either served as a warehouse or a manufacturing unit once. The first floor of the building was labelled “production area”. A room with paint cans was labelled “paint booth”. A small store room with spare computer parts seemed to have been vandalised. The second floor seemed to be under construction without any furniture or fixture and the third floor, too, looked similar. From the terrace, it was clear that the two buildings adjacent to it were completely charred. These seemed to be shops which were burnt beyond recognition and it was unclear what they had sold when they functioned. The roof of the shop on the right had caved in, probably because of a fire. TOI could not enter these shops because the shutters were down. Locals TOI spoke to gave contradictory statements. Members of one community alleged that the attack from Hussain’s building was “pre-planned” and the ammunition had been stored there before the riots broke. “We have recorded everything. He sheltered the people who instigated the violence and killed Ankit Sharma,” alleged one of them. Members from the other community, however, backed Hussain. They did concede that the house was used by a mob but the people came from outside, they said. “Hussain had to be rescued from his house because his house was under attack. It was then that a mob captured his house and used it to wreak havoc in the area,” said a man. "

",Delhi riots: Marauding mobs vent fury on schools too,"NEW DELHI: There were at least 300 students in Victoria Senior Secondary School near Chand Bagh when it came under attack on Monday around 12.30pm. The school is a CBSE examination centre, and the students were writing their Class XII exam when a hundred-strong crowd gathered outside, pelted stones and charged at the gate, lathis in hand. “We managed to secure the main gates and our boundaries, but we had no way of sending the students home because they were candidates from other schools. It was only around 6pm that their parents arrived and they left from the back door,” said caretaker Parveen Sharma. Principal Nawaz Farooq Ahmad ensured everyone exited the premises safely before closing the school indefinitely. When TOI visited the school on Thursday, the building was eerily silent. The windows were shattered, there was a burnt bus outside, its scorched skeleton an indication of the mob frenzy. Two cars stood charred within the school premises. Ironically, the last news update on the bulletin board read, “Pro- and anti-CAA protesters clash in northeast Delhi.” The aftermath of the riots will most impact the students — who have no institutions to return to. Nearby, Arun Modern Public School, which shares it walls with a mosque that was burnt down, resembled a battleground. Its yellow walls were covered in soot, the air was thick with smoke and some parts of the building were still afire. A group of workers was demolishing a wall that had been declared unsafe. According to school owner Brahm Kumar Sharma, “hundreds of people” came and burnt down the building around 5pm. “They vandalised the school and stole computers, water motors, bathroom fittings, everything. We estimate the damage at Rs 2-3 crore,” he despaired. Cashier Neetu Chowdhury alleged that no help arrived till 9pm. “Police did not stop the horde and the fire tenders took five hours to get here,” she said. But her concern was more about the future of the students. “The school had 1,800 students. Where will they study during the time we will take to rebuild?” she asked, showing TOI a few admit cards of students who were slated to appear for their Class X board exams. “We urgently applied for duplicate admit cards for students who had not collected their papers,” she added. Neeraj, a Class X student, was at his blackened school on Thursday. “I don’t know where I will study now,” the youngster said. A student from the madrassa attached to the mosque had a similar story. Mohammad Anas, 11, recounted, “We were praying inside when we heard the mob. Our mufti hid us inside a room. Thankfully the rioters were unable to break down the gates.” He said local residents rescued them and took them home. Further down the lanes, the damage was more severe. Two adjacent schools on the Shiv Vihar-Karawal Nagar stretch — Rajdhani Senior Secondary and DRP —faced the fury of arsonists on Tuesday. While nearly 1,000 students studied in the former, there were 400 in the latter. Their walls had caved in, and there was ashen remains of what once were desks, chairs and blackboards. Manoj Kalouni, caretaker of Rajdhani School for 18 years, his wife Sangeeta and their two children lived in a room on the premises. “After noon, parents began taking the students away because of rioters on the road. By 1pm, all the students and staff had left. But some 500 people forced their way in around 4pm and went on a rampage. We managed to stay hidden on the terrace and then fled to a school nearby to save our lives,” said Kalouni. The family plans to return to their home state of Uttarakhand for good. Kalouni’s friend, who works in the other school, provided him shelter for nearly 60 hours, though there was no food. “The children were hungry but we couldn’t do anything. Security forces finally came to our rescue,” said Kalouni, who lost all his belongings. He doesn’t even have money to return to his village. His only hope is school principal Faisal Farooque. “I hope he gives me some money so I can leave Delhi,” the shaken man said. As students and staff await the return to classrooms, a hand-made poster on one of the school walls relayed an important message. “Education is the ability to listen to everything without losing your temper or self-confidence,” it says. Pity such messages are lost when the students reach adulthood. "

","Delhi government to pay for treatment of all riot victims, to speed up rehab","NEW DELHI: Delhi government will bear all medical expenses of the riot victims even if they are admitted to private hospitals, give up to Rs 10 lakh as compensation to the kin of the dead, and up to Rs 5 lakh each to those who have lost houses in this week’s violence in northeast Delhi. The government has also announced a Rs 1 crore compensation to the family of head constable Ratan Lal who was killed in the riots, besides a job to one member of his family. Eighteen subdivisional magistrates (SDMs) have been deployed to monitor the relief and rehabilitation operations, which were announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday at Delhi Secretariat. While Rs 10 lakh will be given for the death of each adult and Rs 5 lakh for that of a minor, Rs 5 lakh will be provided for permanent disability, and Rs 2 lakh for serious and Rs 20,000 for minor injuries. Kejriwal also announced a compensation of Rs 3 lakh for each child who had been orphaned. A compensation of Rs 5 lakh for each home set afire and that of up to Rs 5 lakh for loss of a shop will be provided. An immediate relief of Rs 25,000 will be released to each household damaged substantially or totally and for the loss of household items. For each burnt rickshaw, the compensation amount will be Rs 25,000. “The incidents of violence in Delhi in the last few days are worrisome, and we have taken whatever steps we could to help all those affected,” Kejriwal said. “Everyone has suffered losses in the riots. Hindus and Muslims have died. A head constable of Delhi Police, Ratan Lal, died in the violence, while an IB officer, Ankit Sharma, was found dead in a drain. No one has benefitted from the violence,” Kejriwal said, adding that it had reduced since Wednesday. The Farishtey Dilli Ke scheme of Delhi government, which provides free treatment to the victims of road accidents in private hospitals, will cover the treatment of the riot victims, the chief minister clarified. The revenue department will carry out a quick survey to facilitate distribution of the compensation amounts. A software application will also be developed where people can upload the details of lost properties/vehicles, damages to the businesses and those related to injuries and deaths. Special camps will be set up by the department for urgent availability of lost important documents, such as voter ID and Aadhaar cards, community and income certificates, and copies of property deeds. The government is providing food, water and other necessities in the curfew areas through residents’ welfare associations, NGOs, assembly members, and local people. Round-the-clock helpline numbers have also been set up in the offices of two district magistrates and four SDMs. East Delhi Municipal Corporation has been told to undertake a clean-up exercise of the entire affected zone under the supervision of the revenue department. “Peace committees are being constituted at the mohalla level to restore normalcy,” the chief minister added. The department will also ask the heads of insurance companies to organise special camps for immediate disbursement of claims. “An insurance loss assessment has to be carried out transparently with very little documentation,” Kejriwal pointed out.

","Delhi: Rioting mobs leave behind ghost town, over 3,000 houses deserted","NEW DELHI: On the roads of certain areas of Shiv Vihar you will not spot a soul. While everyone’s attention has been on the key riot zones like Chand Bagh, Gokulpuri and Maujpur-Jafrabad, areas surrounding Phase 8 and 9 in Shiv Vihar along the Loni border have the eerie look of abandoned habitations. More than 3,000 houses lie abandoned, hundreds have been ransacked. The untended shops and factories of the deserted Shiv Vihar were being looted even when TOI visited the area on Thursday evening. Sudha Devi, 45, one of the few Hindu residents of the area, alleged that police and the city administration had forsaken them. “Where were you when gas cylinders were being used to burn down houses here?,” she asked, her eyes surveying the half burnt houses and charred skeletons of cars. Devi’s husband, a transport department employee, said the family has moved in with relatives in Shanti Nagar. “A crowd of more than 2,000 burnt down these houses on Monday night. It was a nightmare,” he shuddered, adding, “Bhagwan na kare kabhi kisi ke sath ab aisa ho.” The only reason they were in Shiv Vihar was to save their house from arsonists. A mixed locality dominated by Muslims, the houses there still had smoke billowing out on Thursday. Two places of worship were damaged, with the shells of exploded cylinders lying there a tell-tale sign. Rioters, in particular, targeted religious inscriptions. Gaurav Kumar said that all the Muslims had left the colony. “There is no one to talk to even,” the dejected man said, glancing at the charred remains of his neighbours’ houses. A Muslim family, hurrying to leave the area, did not want to say anything. “There is nothing for us here now. We will start our lives somewhere else,” one of the women said. Their voices were the only sound save for the cawing of crows on the entire 25-Foota Road, where some houses had ‘Jai Shri Ram’ scrawled on their doors, obviously to save themselves from the rioters. One landlord talked of his tenants for the past 15 years. “Saleem Sahab and his family packed their bags and left when passions started to intensify on Monday. I never had any problem with them. But seeing what is left now, it is good they left for Bijnor,” he remarked. The water and electricity supply remain cut. Residents said that despite the presence of the Rapid Action Force, there still is fear. “The security personnel are on the main road, not on the interior lanes. It has been four days since we slept properly,” said Gaurav Kumar’s father. “When it turns dark, we sit outside our houses because inside we won’t even come to know if someone comes to burn the house down. At least outside we can run to safety.” The many bakeries in the area were owned by Muslims who had employed mostly Hindu workers and salesman. Ram Kumar, a supply agent for the bakeries, said he had surely lost his source of income with the bakeries all lying shuttered now. He looked dejectedly at children helping themselves to rusks at a bakery he once worked for. Read this story in Bengali"

",Life bounces back: Riot-hit areas in northeast Delhi picking up the pieces,"NEW DELHI: With some grocery shops having reopened, damaged electrical lines being restored, metro stations functioning and at least a few people starting to go about their daily chores, northeast Delhi is slowly trying to move on from the horrors of the last few days. Roads leading to Jafrabad and Maujpur-Babarpur were visibly more active on Thursday. Shops selling essential commodities opened and vegetable and fruit vendors could be seen moving around. However, the pall of gloom persisted. Other riot-affected areas, such as Chand Bagh, Mustafabad, Kabir Nagar and Kardampuri, also saw a semblance of normalcy. Maujpur Chowk, which was until Wednesday occupied by police, was bustling with activity. On Maujpur main road, medical shops opened in the morning. A shopkeeper, Sunil Tyagi, told TOI: “I opened my shop after three days...many people were calling me with urgent requirements. We don’t have enough stocks though. I plan to down the shutters at 1.30pm. I will take a call later about reopening in the evening.” At another shop, senior citizens queued up for medicines. Painkillers were most in demand. Paramilitary forces were stationed in heavy numbers in the inner lanes. Some local traders from both communities could be seen serving refreshments to them. Shashank Sharma (25), a resident of Maujpur, said they were thankful to the forces for restoring normalcy. Rajesh Sharma, who owns a garment shop, said rumours were giving them sleepless nights. “After a generator caught fire near a market in Maujpur, it triggered rumours of arson.” At several places in Maujpur, Shiv Vihar and Gokulpuri, officials were busy restoring the damaged power lines. “Some poles have been burnt down, while at other points arsonists cut off the lines,” a BSES official said. At a bangle shop, Hema Bisht was seen shopping for a relative’s wedding. “No one could come for the pre-wedding celebrations. We couldn’t even purchase anything as shops and roads were shut. I have come out today to buy bangles for the bride,” she said. On the other side of the canal in Kabir Nagar, some shops had reopened. In Chand Bagh, people ventured out on the streets. Police prevented crowds from gathering. The narrow alleys leading from the arterial road between Chand Bagh and Karawal Nagar, which had been blocked by locals, were being opened again. An earthmover was being used to clear the rubble and glass shards. However, uncertainty still haunted those affected by the riots. “My shop was torched and I lost most of my belongings. I have no insurance. How will I rebuild my life?” asked a distressed Bhure Khan, a shop owner who sold fruits and other utilities. Shama Parween, a 45-year-old widow who stitches clothes for a living in Chand Bagh, showed her plastered left foot. “I cannot use the sowing machine right now. I have a house to run and three children to feed. A neighbourhood doctor treated me and told me to keep the plaster on for at least a month. How will I earn a livelihood?” she asked. An East Delhi Municipal Corporation spokesperson said that debris and burnt vehicles were being removed. “We are giving priority to the least-affected areas so that our officials are not attacked and equipment damage. That can demoralise the workers,” he added. "

","Bengal workers escape Delhi violence, take train home","KOLKATA/BEHRAMPORE: As violence, arson and lynching ruled the streets of Maujpur in Delhi on Monday night, 11 labourers from Murshidabad, who had gone to the capital for work, managed to escape the mob and return to their one-room accommodation in a “Hindu neighbourhood” at Ghonda Chowk, barely a kilometre from the riot-torn zone. The next 48 hours were living hell for them, as they remained hidden inside a dingy storeroom without food or sleep, waiting for help to arrive. They, along with two others, were finally rescued on Wednesday night and sent back home in Naoda, Murshidabad. Kamal Shekh landed in Delhi a few weeks ago after he got a job at a fan manufacturing unit in northeast Delhi. His friends, who were already there, offered him to stay with them. “Things were alright till Monday afternoon. We heard about trouble breaking out in some pockets and decided to go home early,” Shekh said. As they walked towards Ghonda Chowk, tension had started building up. “By the time we reached home, managing to dodge attacks or confrontations, it was late. The factory owner told us to leave the place immediately. The violence on the street intensified as the night progressed. We stayed up, fearing an attack any moment,” Shekh said. As day broke, they crept out of their accommodation. “No one spotted us. We took shelter in a small room that the factory owner arranged for us. It was a storage space and there was nothing to eat. Once, we climbed on to the roof to see hundreds of people roaming the lanes, armed with bamboo poles and stones. We climbed back to the room and remained locked for the next two days. Each minute seemed longer than hours,” he said.  As they started calling up people, the first to respond was Bangla Sanskriti Mancha, a Kolkata-based organization. The Mancha members stayed in touch with them but could not enter the area as curfew had been imposed. Tanmay Ghosh, secretary of the organization, said, “A few members took help from AAP leaders and JNU students for the rescue operation.” The news also reached Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury, who contacted MoS for home G Kishan Reddy. “Cops rescued us on Wednesday evening. We could breathe again only after we reached Delhi station,” Shekh said. Chowdhury tweeted: “We have made arrangements for their return and they will reach Kolkata safely...” "

However, instead of the judge holding routine hearings on the division bench that includes justice Talwant Singh, he came out to only pronounce a judgment relating to commercial activities being carried out from residential areas. “This is my last judicial act as a judge of Delhi high court,” Justice S Muralidhar said after which his bench didn’t assemble. A large section of lawyers, including senior advocates, had gathered inside the courtroom to thank Justice Muralidhar. One of them said: “You are an inspiration to many” as they wished him the best on his future assignment. The staff had already communicated to the lawyers, who had matters listed before his bench, that the judge won’t preside after pronouncement of the verdict. Hours after a bench headed by him had slammed Delhi Police for failing to register FIRs in cases of alleged hate speeches by three BJP leaders — Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Kapil Mishra, the Centre cleared February 12 transfer recommendation for justice Muralidhar made by the Supreme Court collegium. Justice Muralidhar is the third senior most judge in Delhi high court after Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice G S Sistani, and had to step in Tuesday night in the other two’s absence. He had conducted an urgent and unprecedented midnight hearing at his residence to issue immediate directions ensuring safe passage for victims holed up in a hospital under siege in northeast Delhi where rioters held sway. On Wednesday, the bench of justices Muralidhar and Talwant Singh had heard a plea seeking lodging of FIRs and arrests for hate speech by BJP functionaries over Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

",Legend Roger Waters recites anti-CAA poem,"NEW DELHI: A month after ‘Sab yaad rakha jayega’ (Everything will be remembered), a poem penned by Mumbai-based Aamir Aziz in protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act went viral online, Pink Floyd co-founder and guitarist Roger Waters read out an English translation of it to protesters at a march in London. At a gathering that demanded release of jailed Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on February 22, Waters described Aziz as a “young poet and activist in Delhi” who is involved in a fight against “fascist, racist Citizenship law”. He added, “I think this kid’s got a future.” Waters, who played the bass, and also wrote songs for the iconic band — two decades ago he staged one of the largest rock concerts in history, ‘The Wall - Live in Berlin’, with a reported attendance of 4,50,000 — said, “Julian is why we are here today, but this is no parochial protest. We are part of a global movement that might be the beginning of the global enlightenment, which this fragile planet so desperately needs.” Pink Floyd’s ‘The Dark Side of the Moon’ (1973), ‘Wish You Were Here’ (1975), and ‘The Wall’ (1979) became massive hits worldwide. By the early 1980s, the band had become one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups of all time. As news spread that Waters was caught on camera quoting Aziz, “Everything will be remembered. Kill us, we will become ghosts and write of your killings, with all the evidence...”, the 29-year-old said he was surprised at his own “popularity”. Talking to TOI on Thursday, Aziz, an alumnus of Delhi-based Jamia Millia Islamia, said, “I am at a loss for words. I do not know how to react to this... It is a matter of pride and honour for me.” Aziz said he felt compelled to write the lines because it was something “he felt strongly for”. The poem was written on January 11, a few days after the attack on Jawaharlal Nehru University students protesting against fee hike. He had also performed it at an anti-CAA protest in Hyderabad on the eve of Republic Day. The Patna-native told TOI that he plans to continue writing on love, life and social issues. At least two of his poems talk about victims of mob lynchings in India. ‘Achche din blues’, released a few days before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, which makes multiple references to demolition of Babri Masjid, also mentions two Muslim cattle traders killed in Jharkhand’s Latehar in 2016. Another of his compositions, ‘Ballad of Pehlu Khan’, tells the tale of Khan, a dairy farmer from Haryana who was allegedly lynched by a mob of cow vigilantes in 2017 in Alwar. It reads: “Pehlu peshe se dairy kisan the, Bas khata itni si thi ki yahin paida huye, Aur, musalmaan the. (Pehlu was a dairy farmer. His only fault was he was born here. And that he was a Muslim). After police crackdown on Jamia students on December 15, he wrote Jamia ki Ladkiyaan (The Women of Jamia) which spoke about women becoming the face of protests when police raised their sticks. "

",Northeast Delhi violence: Gokulpuri drain of horror throws up two more bodies,"NEW DELHI: A day after the discovery of an IB official’s body in a Chand Bagh drain, two more bodies were found floating in Gokulpuri drain near Ganga Vihar junction on Thursday morning. The news spread like wildfire and the authorities started sifting through the clogged drains in northeast Delhi to check if there were more bodies of riot victims stuck in them. Anil Tyagi, employee of irrigation and flood department, said that bloated bodies were found stuck in floating garbage around 8am on Thursday. “As the news spread, a crowd started building up. But since curfew is imposed in the area, forces soon arrived and dispersed the gathering,” he added. Both the bodies were removed around 11am. They were not identified till Thursday evening. When TOI visited the area around 2.30pm, flag marches were being carried out in the colonies aligned along the length of the drain. “Section 144 has been imposed and shoot at sight orders have been received. People are being requested to go to their houses,” a senior police officer was heard announcing on the loudspeakers. Ranjeet Kumar (62), a resident of Bhagirathi Vihar, claimed that the deceased did not belong to the locality and his body might have flown from Mustafabad. The garbage-strewn drains were being scanned by civic officials and police for bodies. A joint meeting in this regard was also held among officials of irrigation and flood department, East Delhi Municipal Corporation and police. EDMC commissioner Dr Dilraj Kaur and spokesperson Arun Kumar later said that the civic body was ready to provide all necessary help to police for the discovery of bodies. TOI also spoke to the relatives of a few other riot victims whose bodies were fished out of the drains earlier. Musharraf’s body was found in the Chand Bagh drain. “We went everywhere but did not find him until someone known to Musharraf (35) told us that he was thrown into the drain. When we could not find him in the drain, we visited GTB Hospital on Thursday morning and found his body there,” said Farheen, the victim’s sister. Mohseen’s (24) body was found in Bhajanpura drain. “Around 5pm on Tuesday, he had to come to Bhajanpura for some work. A mob surrounded his car and asked him to remove his pants. He managed to call up one of his friends. But before anyone could do anything to save him, the men bashed him and threw him in a drain,” said Waris Ali Khan, Mohseen’s uncle. "

The death toll in northeast Delhi's communal violence stands at 44, with over 200 injured. The plea has sought lodging of FIRs against three BJP leaders -- Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Kapil Mishra -- over their alleged hate speeches.

",Tariff unchanged for domestic slab: APERC,"Vijayawada: Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) on Thursday clarified that there was no tariff hike for any slab in domestic category except for the consumption exceeding 500 units per month. In a press release, APERC made it clear that it has found no defect in the billing procedure by discoms and the higher electricity bills are only due to increased consumption. APERC said that change of groups or slabs or delay in meter reading was not the reason for higher electricity bills. The commission announced the present tariff order after consultation with wide-range public who had welcomed the change. No tariff hike was made for any slab in any group except for the consumption exceeding 500 units per month. During review meeting, Justice C V Nagarjuna Reddy, chairman, APERC, said that the commission had given reply to some consumers who filed complaint with the APERC alleging that the discoms were issued the electricity bills for two months based on total consumption which caused substantial increase in billing amount. The commission had carefully examined the electricity bills submitted by Kiran Kumar Reddy, resident of Kurnool, who submitted electricity bills of three consumers to the commission, said APERC. “The billing procedure adopted was not questionable and found to be in order except applying the total consumption in a month for 30 days irrespective of the duration between meter reading days,” the commission said. “This is due to extraordinary situation prevailing due to Covid-19 pandemic,” APERC added.

Several trucks filled with food and clothing went around Mustafabad and Shiv Vihar. At the Eidgah relief camp, the SAD city head met the victims expressed happiness that with the sub-divisional magistrate and government officials themselves involved in the compensation filing, the relief effort would be quickened. “I told the officials that they should visit the relief camps and try to provide the compensation amount as soon as possible because the victims people have lost a lot,” the senior Sarna said. “We want the chief minister and ministers to meet people. That is how you remove their grief. People shouldn't be scared to go back to the mosques and pray.” The relief camps were in full swing on Tuesday, providing materials and other help to the dislocated people. Jameel Ahmed, an imam of a mosque at Babu Nagar, opened up a room in his home for the civil society group that had to shift its free medical service camp from Al-Islah School. “I wanted to provide whatever assistance in helping people get back on their feet, so made space in my home for the medical camp,” Ahmed said. Ahmed’s neighbour Mohammad Dilshad also went ahead and freed the living room in his home for medico-legal work. “We have told the relief providers that we are ready for everything. Everyone faces bad times, but we can all do something to help,” Dilshad philosophised. "

",Situation peaceful but tense in Delhi; Sri Sri Ravi Shankar visits riot-hit areas,"NEW DELHI: A week after deadly communal violence erupted in northeast Delhi, the situation in riot-hit areas remained peaceful but tense on Sunday, though there was movement of more people and vehicles on main roads amid a heavy police deployment. ""The situation is under control now. There is adequate force deployed in all areas of northeast district. We are holding talks with locals and trying to rebuild confidence,"" a senior police official said. No untoward incident has been reported from the northeast district over the past three days, he said, adding police are urging residents to not pay attention to rumours and report them to authorities. Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar visited some of the riot-hit areas, including Brahmapuri, and consoled the people disturbed by the worst violence in three decades in Delhi. ""It is so disturbing to see that so many people are badly affected. We have to relieve them of trauma and bring their lives back on track. Everyone should come together to do this,"" he told reporters. ""We should learn from these people who saved others, who have stood for humanity. And we should sideline and punish the anti-social elements,"" he added. The violence in Jaffrabad, Maujpur, Babarpur, Chand Bagh, Shiv Vihar, Bhajan Pura, Yamuna Vihar and Mustafabad areas of northeast Delhi claimed at least 42 lives and left over 200 injured. A large number of properties were damaged. Frenzied mobs torched houses, shops, vehicles, a petrol pump and pelted stones at locals and police personnel. Even days after the violence, there was an eerie silence in the streets that once used to be teeming with people and hawkers. In Shiv Vihar, among the worst hit areas, the lanes were deserted and almost all the houses locked. In Mustafabad, people were wary of stepping out of their homes in narrow bylanes. ""Though there is police presence, tension is lingering. We celebrated Eid, Holi, Diwali together. I have never faced such a situation in my life. There is grief, mistrust, disbelief. Those who indulged in violence did not belong to the area, they came from outside,"" said Mohammad Yunus, 45. Yunus, who owns a garment store in Shiv Vihar, said he was saved by his Hindu neighbours during the violence and they tore the shop name-board outside to save the business from rioters. Acting Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava visited DCP Amit Sharma, undergoing treatment at a hospital in Patparganj after suffering serious injuries during the violence in Gokulpuri on February 24. A 2010-batch IPS officer, Sharma has undergone brain surgery.

On Tuesday, some of them breathed their last, raising the death toll to 13. Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital was swamped with relatives of the deceased. Among them were the inconsolable family members of Shahid Khan (22), who came in the line of fire while returning home along with his brother after offering prayers. While his brother managed to dodge the bullets, Khan collapsed in a pool of blood after being shot. He and his wife were planning to go on vacation next month. They had got married in September last year. “His wife is three months pregnant. Their future plans died along with him,” said Khan’s grieving elder brother, Imran. When Khan didn’t return on the fateful day, the family members started to panic. When they heard a knock on the door, they thought he had finally reached. “But it was a stranger who showed us a picture of Shahid lying in a pool of blood in Bhajanpura. We were told that two men had taken him to GTB Hospital. We rushed there and found him dead,” Imran said. Khan was the youngest of four brothers. Like Khan, 32-year-old Furqan was shot dead when he ventured out to buy food. Mohammad Imran, his elder brother, said that Furqan, who had a handicraft business, wanted to buy essential food items to store in the house. Mohammed said the street was relatively clear when he went outside. He had only walked a few hundred metres when a stray bullet hit him. “I was at work when a relative called me saying that Furqan had been shot. I rushed home and we took him to the hospital. He was bleeding profusely and succumbed to his injuries,” said Mohammed. Furqan got married in 2014 and had two children, a four-year-old girl and a two-year-old boy. Mohammed said his brother always kept his family first. “This is probably the reason why he went out. He only wanted us to be safe. Though things were tense in the area, we never expected this to happen,” he added. The autopsy was carried out at GTB Hospital. Another victim, Rahul Solanki (26), a civil engineer by profession, was at home till 5pm. He had assured his colleagues at 4.30pm that all was well and he would meet them the next day. However, within an hour, his colleagues received a call that Solanki had been shot dead by rioters. “We got to know about the riots and people from office had called him up immediately asking him to take care. He said everything was fine. An hour later, we came to know that he had been shot,” said Shweta Chauhan, a colleague. Solanki’s father was inconsolable. He said everyone in their family was excited about his daughter’s marriage due in early April. They had been busy with the preparations for the past couple of months. “He had taken leave from work because of the tense situation in the area.

",Northeast Delhi riot accused turns out to be man who took gunshot victim to hospital,"NEW DELHI: A recent bail order of a man accused of rioting in northeast Delhi in February this year has revealed that he had, in fact, rushed a gunshot victim from his locality to a hospital. Asad (23), through his counsel UA Khan, had sought bail with the contention that he had helped a person named Aasif, who was injured by a bullet during the riots. The counsel also said that no specific role in the case had been attributed to Asad. The prosecutor, however, argued that the applicant was a “close associate of the accused persons”. In his testimony, the investigating officer first stated that a patrol officer saw a large number of rioters near Jafrabad Metro station who pelted stones and then he heard a gunshot. He said Asad was standing with the rioters and sloganeering. However, when the court specifically asked if Asad had caused the gunshot injury, the IO replied in the negative. He also admitted that Asad had taken the injured man to hospital. Additional sessions judge Manjushwa Wadhwa then held that the applicant hadn’t caused the gunshot injury and he deserved bail. ‘Riot accused under scanner in 700 cases’Keeping in view that the investigation in the present matter qua the applicant is complete and the fact that he did not cause the gunshot injury to the victim, rather he had taken the injured to the hospital, the applicant is admitted to bail,"" the court said. He was directed to furnish a bail bond of Rs 20,000 with one surety of the same amount. The prosecution had argued that Asad’s role was being ""scanned"" in about 700 cases registered in relation to the riots. ""He may threaten the complainant and get involved in similar offences, if released on bail,"" it was contended. In Video:Delhi riot accused turns out to be man who took gunshot victim to hospital"

Smoke from the streets was seen going up in some places and streets in Maujpur on Monday. Maujpur-Babarpur metro station remains closed. A resident in Maujpur said he has seen a riot like situation such as this for the first time in 35 years. ""The area had always remained peaceful,"" he told PTI, requesting anonymity. SeelampurOn Tuesday, shops remained closed in Seelampur and Jaffrabad, with shopkeepers hesitant to open their premises due to fears that arsonists may target them. Police have set up barricades in Seelampur, allowing traffic on only one side of the road. Police were also dispersing people standing in groups in the area so as to prevent any untoward incident. BrahampuriSmall groups of miscreants were seen throwing stones at the police and commoners. However, due to the presence and vigilance of the police, they failed to spread mass violence.

",Head constable Ratan Lal who always took up tough challenges,"NEW DELHI: On February 27 last year, head constable Ratan Lal was the talking point among his colleagues and seniors because his moustache was similar to Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who had shot down a Pak F-16 fighter jet that day. Exactly a year later, the 42-year-old policeman died a heroic death while bravely fighting rioters in northeast Delhi. He had joined Delhi Police in 1998 as a constable. Lal was currently posted in Gokulpuri. The ACP he reported to was also injured in the riots. Known to be a confident and brave cop, Lal led many raids conducted by Gokulpuri police in the last few years because of his strong built. “An outstanding policeman with indefatigable attitude and tremendous positive energy,” recalled additional DCP Brijender Yadav to whom Lal reported to a few years ago. Yadav, in his profile as ACP (Gokulpuri), had given many citations to Lal for his excellent performance. Born in a middle-class family in Sikar, Rajasthan, Lal was the eldest among three brothers and a sister. He lived with his wife and three children — two girls aged 11 and 12 and a boy aged 8 — in north Delhi’s Burari. He had promised his children that they would celebrate Holi at their village in Tihawali. He had lost his father a decade ago. His mother has not been informed of his death as yet. “My brother-in law informed us about his death and we immediately switched off the TV so that our mother does not see anything. She knows we are hiding something from her as people are coming to meet us more than usual. She doesn’t know how to use social media, so she cannot get to know of his death online,” said a family member. Speaking to TOI, Lal’s younger brother Dinesh said, “He was a patriot. He wanted to don the uniform from the very beginning. He had immense patience. We never saw him scream or shout at people. He last came over a month ago when a relative had passed away.” Dinesh appealed to people not to be violent. “I lost my brother today, but tomorrow it could be anyone else,” he added. Lal’s colleagues said he would always volunteer for difficult and dangerous assignments. “He was instrumental in nabbing the accused in a gruesome rape of two tribal women in 2013 and in an act of vandalism committed by a group of wrestlers at a restaurant in Seemapuri,” said an officer. His villagers have demanded a “martyr” status for him and that he be consigned to flames with full state honours. They have also demanded that the government school in Tihawali be named after Lal. "

",Northeast Delhi violence: Alarmed cops on alert after intel report,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Police will be on very high alert in the next 24 hours as intelligence agencies have received inputs that the riots in the city could intensify in order to put the international spotlight on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) with President Donald Trump in the capital. The intelligence branch and Special Cell are keeping a close tab on the developments and coordinating with the intelligence bureau with regular updates which are being further shared with secret service officials who are in charge of Trump’s security. The security on routes leading to Rajghat was reviewed on Monday evening and additional forces will be deployed to keep it out of bounds for people. The agencies are also learnt to be probing the role of at least three organisations, including Popular Front of India (PFI), in fanning Monday’s violence which spiralled out of control. The outfit is already under probe on allegations of funding anti-CAA protests in UP and Delhi. Cop, 4 others die as clashes and arson scorch north-east DelhiAfter the death of one of its cops and injuries to four dozen others, the police brass is reworking its strategy to tackle the riots. A meeting was called late on Monday to review the situation and decide the plan of action for Tuesday. The plan to whip up frenzy in north-east Delhi seems to have been set in motion days in advance and only intensified on Sunday night. Stones and Molotov cocktails were piled up at strategic locations like houses, rooftops, balconies and corners of lanes inside colonies. It is disturbing that the police did not anticipate this or failed to crack down. Perhaps because of the impending visit of the US President or lack of leadership and clear orders from the police brass, the force was evidently ill-prepared and hesitant in nipping the trouble in the bud. They were inadequately deployed in such a volatile area and reinforcements had to be rushed in and later additional forces deployed when much of the damage was done. Many cops agreed that there seemed to have been a lack of preventive measures too compared with the past scenarios where Delhi Police even moved to restrict internet services in several areas of Delhi during the anti-CAA protests in mid-December. TOI spoke to several policemen who have watched over law and order in the capital for over two decades and many of them agreed that the police did not seem to be on the front foot this time. “Alarm bells should have rang after Sunday evening’s stone-pelting in Maujpur and incidents of arson at Karawal Nagar late at night but the police brass, it appears, chose to remain in wait-and-watch mode and started reacting in haste when things spun out of control on Monday noon,” he said. In fact, TOI was witness to multiple instances where rioters beat up people after asking for their names and set a shop and a house on fire in the presence of the police. Delhi Police, however, denied being lax and said they took appropriate measures. In a statement issued around 4.30pm on Monday, the department casually said that “some incidents of violence and arson had been reported in the areas of north-east district, particularly Maujpur, Kardampuri, Chand Bagh and Dayalpur...strict action will be taken against miscreants and anti social elements”. Delhi Police has also compiled a detailed report on Monday’s violence and it will be submitted to the ministry of home affairs late on Monday night or Tuesday, said an officer. "

",Jamia Millia Islamia student held for role in December violence,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Crime Branch has arrested a BA student from Jamia Millia Islamia for his alleged involvement in the riots that took place outside the university in December last year. Asif Iqbal Tanha, an office-bearer of Students Islamic Organisation, was allegedly found to be instigating some students for violence during the anti-CAA protests outside the university on December 16. He was arrested on the basis of eyewitness accounts. Tanha, a resident of Hazaribagh in Jharkhand, was staying in Abul Fazl Enclave and pursuing a bachelor’s course in Arabic from Jamia. He was also one of the leaders of the United Against Hate movement. Tanha, along with student leader Chandan Kumar and former MLA Asif Muhammad Khan, was named in the FIR registered at the Jamia Nagar police station after the December violence. The Crime Branch called Tanha for questioning at their office in Chanakyapuri and arrested him. “In several videos, Tanha was seen leading students who later got violent and started pelting stones,” said police sources. During interrogation, the accused told the police officers that he tried to contain the students, but left the spot when the crowd grew violent. The FIR against Tanha stated that he had asked his followers to block the road near the university even as a mob had gone berserk and burnt several DTC buses. He, along with others, had allegedly been provoking the students for three days before the riots broke out. Tanha was produced before a judge and later sent to judicial custody till May 31. The other two accused are likely to be called for questioning soon. “Tanha had played an active role in organising protests and riots at Jamia in December 2019. He is a close associate of Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, Meeran Haider and Shafoora who were the key members of anti-CAA protests and subsequent riots,” said an officer. "

Incidentally, Bhainsa made headlines in January too after communal clashes left 19 people, including cops, injured over a petty issue, honking. Trouble began around 9.15pm when a 29-year-old man from Shivaji Nagar allegedly trespassed into a place of worship in his neighbourhood and started abusing a group of people offering prayers, police said. “The accused was in a drunken condition. Initially, he used foul language against his neighbours and then entered the place of worship. While he was causing nuisance, his father brought him out. Later, when people at the place of worship were returning home, he confronted them and both the groups assaulted each other,” Bhainsa DSP Narsing Rao said. Later, worshippers returned to their locality and informed members of their community about the incident. Soon about 200 members from rival groups gathered between Shivaji Nagar and Owaisi Nagar. “The rival groups started pelting stones at each another. We reached there and dispersed the mob,” the DSP added. Around 10.15pm, a 22-year-old grocery store worker from Kunta area was assaulted by 14 persons from Shivaji Nagar when he went to hand over groceries to an acquaintance. “The grocery store worker suffered head injury when he was attacked with a stick,” Nirmal SP C Shashidhar Raju said.

",Entered Jamia Millia Islamia to rescue innocent students: Delhi cops,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Monday claimed that it took action inside the campus of Jamia Millia Islamia on the eve of protests in December last year to “rescue innocent students trapped inside and to ensure normalcy”. The claims are part of an action taken report (ATR) filed before a Delhi court on a plea of the university registrar seeking action against cops for “unauthorised entry and excessive force”. On January 22, the court had asked Jamia Nagar police to file the ATR on the plea filed by the university on excessive police action in its campus on December 15. The court was acting on the university’s plea seeking registration of FIR against “accused persons”. The court had asked the SHO of Jamia police station to inform by March 16, whether any complaint has been received from the university by the police. “If yes, whether any action has been taken on the said complaint. Whether any investigation or inquiry has been conducted in this regard, and if yes, what’s its status? If any cognizable offence is made out, whether any FIR has been registered or not,” it had said. Delhi Police, however, refuted the varsity’s claims justifying its action. Its ATR read, “Action was required to be taken in light of the on-going violence from within the university campus and to rescue innocent students trapped inside and to ensure normalcy.” Police also went on to claim that cops were unable to distinguish between the “trapped students and rioters”, who allegedly carried petrol bombs. “Therefore, all were asked to evacuate with their ‘hands up’. This exercise was undertaken as it was already dark. Rioters had destroyed /damaged the lights inside the campus,” it claimed. The ATR further said that an “unruly mob” which was slowly retreating, instead of dispersing strategically went inside the Jamia campus and used the university campus as a cover. “It started pelting stones, tube-lights, etc., resulting in grievous injuries to the police personnel. Police said that a few miscreants had entered into the university complex and considering the situation, police reached outside the varsity campus. “With a view to contain violence and maintain law and order, police was constrained to enter the university campus,” it said. According to its claims, 52 people were held. The court has posted the matter for hearing on April 7. "

",Bombay high court says Mumbai court can try US domestic violence complaint,"MUMBAI: If an incident of domestic violence has occurred in the US, a magistrate in Mumbai has jurisdiction to try the complaint and it is not time-bound, the Bombay high court held recently while dismissing a plea by a US-based IT professional. Justice Sambhaji Shinde's verdict came on a petition by a 40-year-old man after the Mulund metropolitan magistrate ordered him to pay interim maintenance to his wife and minor son and the sessions court dismissed his appeal. The couple got married in Lucknow in 2008 as per Muslim rites and left for the US. Their son was born in 2013. Due to differences, the woman moved in with her brother in 2014. The husband filed for divorce in the California superior court and sought custody of the child. In 2015, the woman returned to India. The husband subsequently divorced her in India. In 2016, the US court granted custody to the father and issued an arrest warrant for the mother. The woman filed a case under the Domestic Violence Act, 2005. In 2017, the Mulund magistrate directed interim maintenance of Rs 30,000 to the wife and Rs 15,000 to the son. The sessions court upheld the order. In HC, the husband's advocate Prashant Pandey argued there was over two years' delay by the wife in filing the complaint and, on this ground alone, it ought to have been dismissed. He further contended the magistrate had no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint since the alleged domestic violence had not been committed in India. The wife's advocate countered she had filed the case here as she lived in Mumbai with her brother. Justice Shinde noted a precedent in a Supreme Court verdict where the apex court had held that the place where the wife takes shelter after leaving or being driven away from the matrimonial home on account of cruelty by husband or relatives would also have jurisdiction to entertain complaints under section 498 A (cruelty) IPC. In his September 25 judgment, justice Shinde said in view of the SC's verdict and also observations by both lower courts, ""there is no substance in the contention"" regarding jurisdiction. He also cited another SC verdict to rule out the contention over inordinate delay in filing complaint. "

Schedule Indian airlines had 614 operational aircraft this January, a number that dropped to 533 when Jet Airways shut down in April. This was the first time that domestic air travel growth declined, and touched negative zone in April. “Indian carriers at the moment have 628 operational aircraft in their fleet. This additional seat capacity saw a return to double digit growth. The 11.2% domestic growth of November 2019 (over same month last year) is the highest we have had so far this year. Airlines are adding more aircraft and we hope this growth will continue,” said a senior aviation official. In January-November, 2019, 13.1 crore people have flown within the country — up 3.9% from 12.6 crore in same period last year. Apart from the overall economic situation, the aviation growth currently hinges on the fate of cash-strapped Air India which has sought emergency funding to keep flying for some more time till the outcome of its second divestment bid is known. If, hopefully, AI is acquired by a strong player the growth will continue unabated. Tata Sons-Singapore Airline JV Vistara is seen among the likely bidders for AI. “India is one of the most expensive places for running an airline as fuel for domestic flights is among the costliest here globally. There is massive airport infra crunch and the development of secondary airports in places like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Patna has been hugely delayed. Same is the case with expanding airports that have land available, like at Delhi’s IGI Airport. As a result, every few years a big airline shuts down here. India must provide a viable and sustainable environment for airlines in terms of reasonable operating costs and adequate infra. Only then Indian airlines can survive and thrive,” said an airline official. Jet fuel being brought under GST is key for reducing operating cost. Another official added that Jet and AI were/are the only Indian carriers that had/have wide body aircraft in their fleet. “India generates huge amount of international traffic. But apart from AI that faces an uncertain future, our own carriers can take us maximum to Istanbul in the west and Hong Kong in the east. So we have become a feeder market for mega airlines in nearby regions of Gulf and southeast Asia to fly people between India and the Americas, Europe, Australia and Africa. If we have viable airlines, they can fly people on their own planes across the world,” said the second official. Vistara is going to start inducting wide body in its fleet from next February but growing organically is always a gradual process. The inorganic route for faster growth is acquiring AI. But whether that happens remains to be seen. "

",Give clarity on domestic staff: RWAs,"Ghaziabad: Despite the Union government easing some lockdown restrictions, the Federation of Association of Apartment Owners (FedAOA) on Tuesday wrote to the district administration seeking clarity on the entry of domestic staff and technicians to repair fridges and TV sets. The letter comes in the backdrop of a lack of clear-cut guidelines on issues like the entry of domestic helps, car cleaners and repairmen from the district administration, prompting various resident bodies to follow different rules. In its letter to the district magistrate, the federation, which has over 100 societies of Ghaziabad as its members, sought clarification on five points which are becoming a cause of friction between residents and AOAs. These include whether helps, car washers, washermen and drivers are allowed to work in societies in multiple houses during 7 am to 7 pm and whether guests of residents can visit them without having any pass or medical certificate. For instance, on Monday an argument had broken out between the AOA members of a group housing society, Ashiana Upvan, and a resident in Indirapuram over the entry of his relatives, who were stuck in a different place at the time of the lockdown. The AOA members were in a dilemma whether to allow them and tried to seek instructions from administrative officials on the phone, but got no response. Later, cops were called, but they also refused to intervene in the matter. Anil Sharma, who is the Ashiana Upvan president and secretary of the FedAOA, said, “Clarity is missing on the issues pertaining to societies in the new lockdown norms.” The FedAOA has also sought clarification on the extent to which delivery boys can come inside the society — till the main entrance or the doorsteps of an individual’s home. Also as many people are still found going on morning and evening walks or cycling inside the society complex, the federation has also asked the DM whether it can be allowed after taking precautions like social distancing and wearing masks. “The administration cannot shun its duty by not issuing any guidelines for societies, absence of which is causing huge confusion among residents and AOAs,” Alok Kumar of FedAOA, said. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey told TOI that domestic helps, car cleaners and mechanics are not allowed in Ghaziabad. “We have issued a detailed list of activities which have been allowed and anything that does not figure in the list obviously means that it has not been allowed,” he said.

","Hope flickers, and then sudden death: Families end long search at mortuaries","NEW DELHI: For more than 50 families affected by the riots in north-east Delhi, the search for missing members has taken them to hospitals and mortuaries. For some, there has been closure with 20 bodies having been identified till Monday while the rest are still looking. For a family of four, the search ended on Monday at GTB Hospital. A 20-year-old woman, along with two daughters, eight months and four years of age, had been desperately looking for her husband since February 25. When she was finally on the verge of giving up, she got a call from GTB Hospital about a new body that had been brought there. It was that of her husband. “He had left home to get milk for our mother who was unwell,” recalled an inconsolable Mohammed Naseem, brother of the deceased, Mohammed Jameel, 26. “When he had stepped out, things were normal, but in no time, the area turned into a battlefield. There were angry people everywhere who just wanted to kill. I am sure my brother would not have done anything. We got really worried when he didn’t return home. We looked for him everywhere but drew a blank.” Naseem said they kept on returning to GTB but were repeatedly turned away. “Today, we finally found him at the same hospital. His body was brought here after being fished out of the Sonia Vihar drain. Doctors say his throat has been slit,” said Naseem. Jameel’s wife was waiting outside the mortuary on Monday, waiting to take the body to their ancestral village in Bihar to conduct the last rites.  Delhi high court had directed hospital authorities and the police to preserve each unidentified body at least till March 11 with the next hearing on the riots being March 12. The high court had also issued directions for video-recording all autopsies and preserving DNA samples of all bodies currently in the mortuaries. The search for eight other families had similarly ended at Al Hind Hospital where the bodies were stored. One family turned out to be lucky in a way — their man had been arrested. Most of these men went missing on February 25 when they had gone out to buy food items for their family members anticipating a riot-like situation. Matloon Alam, however, is still looking for his younger brother. A resident of Hussain Vihar locality in northeast Delhi, Alam said his 22-year-old brother, Shahbaaz, a welder, disappeared from Karawal Nagar on February 25 while returning home from a hospital where he had gone for a health check-up. The violence in northeast Delhi started on February 23 on a 2km stretch connecting Jafrabad and Maujpur and spread to other areas later. Between February 23 and March 2, nine police stations in north-east Delhi — Khajuri Khas, Karawal Nagar, Nand Nagri, Jafrabad, Seelampur, Gokalpuri, Jyoti Nagar, Dayalpur and Bhajanpura — recorded complaints about missing persons.

",Breakthrough in Delhi riots probe: One held for killing sweet shop staffer,"NEW DELHI: Making its second big breakthrough in its probe in the north-east Delhi riots, the special investigation team (SIT) of Delhi Police has arrested a man, Mohammed Shehnawaz, in the case of murder of sweet shop employee Dilbar Singh Negi (20). It had earlier arrested AAP councillor Tahir Hussain in the case of murder of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma.  Shehnawaz alias Shanu (27) is a resident of Shiv Vihar. Negi, who worked at one Anil sweet shop in the area, was allegedly brutally killed by Shehnawaz and associates on February 24. This was during the violence that broke out near the Shiv Vihar tri-junction in which Shehnawaz and several other persons were seen throwing stones and ransacking and setting fire to several shops there, said police. ""Shehnawaz had entered a book store and a sweet shop godown at A-29, Chaman Park, Shiv Vihar, and torched both places along with other rioters,"" said a senior officer.  The body of Negi was found at the Chaman Park shop on February 26. Both hands had been chopped and the body burnt. Police said Shehnawaz and his accomplices took away Negi's hands and dumped them elsewhere. Police are quizzing him to find out where the limbs were dumped. An FIR was filed after eyewitnesses identified Shehnawaz as the main aggressor leading the mob on February 24. Police: Shehnawaz said he followed his friendsThe police are interrogating Shehnawaz and raids are being conducted to arrest his accomplices. It was found that he was in touch with local criminals who were his regular customers and had accompanied them during the riots. Shehnawaz, according to the police, has said that he owned a shop selling cigarettes near the sweet shop where Negi used to work. He claimed to have attacked him since he had seen his friends in the area doing the same at other shops and believed he could get away with it. Meanwhile, at his village near Pauri Garhwal, Uttarakhand, Negi’s family is struggling to make both ends meet. “He used to send some of his earnings to us and save a little as he planned to complete his graduation. The shop-owner who had employed him had given him refuge at his house. In fact, he was to return home a few days before Holi and celebrate the festival with us,” said his elder brother, Jitender. According to the family, Negi had gone to Delhi just four months back to earn so that he could look after his family of four. His father, Gopal, a former government contractor at Pauri is bedridden. He had suffered paralysis a few years back. While Jitender stayed back at home to look after the family, Negi went to Delhi with the help of a relative to look for work. “We got to know about the incident from the shop-owner who employed him. My parents have been inconsolable since then. We have spent whatever savings we had on our father’s treatment. Apart from a plot of land here, we don’t have much. I can’t even go out to work since my parents would be left alone,” said Jitender. "

",‘Fin insecurity triggers domestic abuse’,"Thiruvananthapuram: A quick study conducted by Kerala Institute of Local Administration (Kila) has cited financial insecurity as one of the major reasons for domestic abuses during the lockdown period, which the UN Women termed ‘shadow pandemic’. During the lockdown period from March 23 to April 18, various helplines in the state received 188 complaints of domestic abuse, of which 102 were about physical abuse.Among various reasons, financial difficulty was cited as reason behind 40 cases and alcoholism behind 28. While 13 cases were related to suspicion, four cases were for refusing to have sex. Kila conducted an analysis of the complaints received by various helplines run by organizations such as Bhoomika, Mitra and Sakhi. In tune with international studies that prove a connection between stress caused by financial insecurities and increasing domestic violence, KILA too cited that financial issues caused by the spread of Covid-19 are affecting women the most. A field level study, on the other hand, showed that non-availability of alcohol has contributed to a peaceful environment in various homes. Abusive partners are the major villains in most cases. Husbands are cited as the accused in 131 cases, while in-laws are the abusers in 23 cases. Children are the accused in 10 cases while parents are abusers in six cases. One of the major observations of the report is that the number of unreported cases would be much higher than those reported. Mobility issues due to lockdown, presence of the accused in the house, lack of mobile phone and internet facilities or options for recharge, lack of alternative accommodation for stay if abandoned from the house, etc. were found to be some reasons for non-reporting. In Kasaragod, some women facing domestic abuse cited that they feared reporting as they have no option at the time of pandemic. One of the significant observations in the study is the failure of women to recognize sexual abuse as a crime due to the social condition which normalizes marital rape. Kila director general Joy Elamon said that it was not an elaborate study, but a quick one to understand the situation. He said that the study points to the need to strengthen social support system and to senstitize public through various options. He said that number of cases was not important as many victims would not be able to report due to various reasons. “Women are made to bear the stress if a man loses job or faces pay cut. Their own job loss is another concern,” he said. Elamon said that in some houses, lockdown has opened up avenue for families to spend more time together, sharing domestic chores and for a better environment. "

","Delhi violence: I&B ministry lifts 48-hour ban on Asianet News, Media One","NEW DELHI: Media One and Asianet News, the two Malayalam language channels that were placed under a 48-hour ban by the Union ministry of information and broadcasting were back on air on Saturday morning. Following the lifting of the ban, Asianet News was back on air at 1.30 am and Media One at 9.30 am. The I&B ministry on Friday imposed a 48-hour ban for their alleged “biased” reportage of the Delhi violence. The action against Asianet News and Media One follows the ministry’s accusation that both channels flouted the programme code and “highlighted the attack on places of worship” and sided with one particular community. The ban order came under sharp protests by the from the political class who referred to the decision as an unprecedented attack on media freedom. Congress leader P Chidambaram and CPM chief Sitaram Yechury condemned the action as “undemocratic and authoritarian”. In its order on Media One, the government had also said the channel deliberately focused on vandalism by CAA supporters. “It also questions RSS and alleges Delhi Police inaction. Channel seems to be critical towards Delhi Police and RSS,” the ministry’s March 6 order said. The ministry also showcaused Media One, but remained dissatisfied with the channel’s response. Media One editor in chief CL Thomas, however, had condemned the government action as an attack on “free and fair journalism” and said the organisation would challenge the government’s decision legally. In the case of Asianet News, the ministry had taken exception to the channel alleging that the “central government did not act to control the riots, and central forces reached the riot hit areas after long hours of the meeting of Union minister Amit Shah.” Both channels were issued show-cause notices by the ministry, in which they defended their reportage and asserted the coverage was not contemptuous of any of any religious group. However, the ministry remained unimpressed and imposed the 48-hour ban on their telecast. Modi govt backs press freedom: JavadekarUnion Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar on Saturday stated that the Narendra Modi government supports the freedom of press. Speaking to reporters in Pune about the ban on two channels, Javadekar said that he would look into the matter and issue orders if necessary. He also said the prime minister has expressed concern over the entire issue. The 48-hour ban was imposed on Asianet News and Media One on Friday for reportage that could ""enhance communal disharmony"" across the country. "

",CCTVs wrecked before Delhi riots: Cops,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has recovered footage from a CCTV camera in northeast Delhi’s Chand Bagh showing a group of men damaging and disabling the cameras before a full-fledged riots broke out in the area on February 24. The footage is from the spot from where a group of outnumbered policemen were cornered by a mob and attacked. While a head constable was shot during the assault, a DCP and an ACP were critically injured. The injured DCP, Amit Sharma, is still undergoing treatment in a hospital. The footage shows the group looking for CCTV cameras and finally assembling around a pole where they spotted a camera. One of them is seen climbing and turning the camera towards policemen so that it could not record anything from the scene. However, all these activities were captured. Police have now sought assistance from the locals to identify the rioters. The CCTV footage is being considered crucial for many reasons. It has given more credence to the initial leads suggesting that the riots did not break out suddenly but were the fallout of a well-hatched conspiracy. Police now have over two dozen videos, which would be used to identify the rioters. Delhi Police has also begun a probe to ascertain whether DCP Sharma and others were called closer by the rioters for a talk and then attacked. Several versions, including that of Sharma’s wife, have emerged, which indicate that the cops were called by the rioters for talks and then assaulted. The cops will record the statements of the injured personnel, especially those who were rescued and were with Sharma throughout. Meanwhile, police on Friday began an extensive interrogation of suspended AAP councillor arrested in the IB official Ankit Sharma murder case. A Crime Branch source said that after leaving Mustafabad on February 27, Hussain went to Zakir Nagar to hide. He lived there for two days, but kept changing houses and used a different mobile number. The cops have not yet recovered any of the mobile phones used by him. Hussain later proceeded to UP and this was when the cops got a lead. They raided some locations along with Tajpur in Amroha, but Hussain managed to evade them. “Around six suspects who were seen with him have been identified, which also includes his step brother Shah Alam. Hussain was using his SUV to commute,” said an officer. "

",Domestic air passenger traffic grew by 8.98% in February: DGCA,"NEW DELHI: Domestic air passenger traffic in February increased by 8.98 per cent to 1.236 crore as compared to the same period last year, according to data released on Wednesday by aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). However, the rise in the number of domestic air passengers for January was just 2.2 per cent when compared with the figures of the corresponding period in 2019. According to the DGCA data, passenger load factors (PLFs) of all major airlines -- Air India, SpiceJet, GoAir, IndiGo, AirAsia India and Vistara -- increased in February as compared to January. PLF measures the seat capacity utilisation of the airline. At 93 per cent, SpiceJet saw the highest passenger load factor in February. At number two, GoAir had 90.5 per cent load factor. ""SpiceJet has yet again recorded the industry's highest load factor of 93 per cent for the month of February 2020 – the 58th successive month that we have flown with over 90 per cent PLF. I am happy that we have achieved such a high PLF in a lean travel month,"" said Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director, SpiceJet. ""The Indian aviation industry has been hit by an unprecedented crisis. I hope the situation improves in the coming weeks and travel demand picks up again soon,"" he added. In its report the DGCA stated, ""The passenger load factor in the month of February 2020 has shown increasing trend primarily due to airlines offering promotional fares resulting in increased demand."" With 83.4 per cent, AirAsia India was number one in on-time performance (OTP) measured at four metro cities -- Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai. Sunil Bhaskaran, CEO and managing director of AirAsia India, said, ""We are delighted to continue to be the leader in punctuality (on-time performance metric) in the Indian aviation landscape."" ""We strive to ensure that we always incorporate and adapt best international practices and hope to continue to stay the course in all aspects of our operations,"" he said. IndiGo at 81.6 per cent and GoAir at 78.6 per cent were number two and three respectively on OTP performance at these four cities. Indigo also maintained its lead position with 48 per cent share of the domestic passenger market in February 2020. SpiceJet's market share decreased from 16.6 per cent in January to 15.3 per cent in February, even as it retained the number two spot, as per the data. The market share of Air India, GoAir, AirAsia India and Vistara was 12 per cent, 10 per cent, 7.3 per cent and 6.7 per cent respectively last month. In February, a total of 790 passenger-related complaints were received by the domestic airlines. The number of complaints per 10,000 passengers carried for the same month was around 0.64, according to the data. Among the major domestic airlines, Air India topped the list of passenger grievances with 1.9 complaints per 10,000 passengers in February, while GoAir was at number two position with one complaint per 10,000 passengers.

",Domestic violence victims struggle to get free legal aid,"CHENNAI: There have been complaints from indigent victims of domestic violence who sought free legal assistance from the Tamil Nadu State Legal Services Authority (TNSLSA) that the lawyers assigned to them fleece them in the guise of incidental expenses like travel and food. The Legal Services Authority Act, 1987, was implemented to provide free legal aid to the poor and marginalized across the country. It offers free services of lawyers who volunteer to take up the cases of the poor. They are in turn paid by the TNSLSA as per the rates fixed by the committee. Though the amount paid to the lawyers are minimum and cannot be matched with the market rates, legal aid advocates are prohibited from taking money from their clients in any manner. However, despite such prohibition imposed by the act, the ground reality seems to be riddled with complexities. “I have spent Rs11,000 in the last three months paying for my lawyer’s expenses,” alleged Mamta* a domestic worker who sought assistance from the panel to help her daughter, a victim of domestic violence. “Her husband would physically torture her every day and after she delivered a stillborn baby, he threw her out and married another woman. Since I couldn’t afford a lawyer I went to the district legal aid, but I’m struggling to afford them too,” she said. Mamta’s case is due next month at the Sub Court in Poonamallee. “I have spent all my savings on this case so far. I just don’t have anything left,” she said. Rukmini*, another litigant who has sought the legal aid assistance for a dowry harassment case filed against her husband said, “Lawyers say they do not have enough money to make the ends meet, and hence charge us.” Her legal aid had demanded the money towards case filing, food expenses and travel. The monthly fee for legal aid on the panel is Rs1,500. The fee for appearing before a family court is Rs3,000 per case (it is assumed that each case will take longer than four hearings to complete). Similarly, the amount paid for filing a bail application before a magistrate court is Rs500 and for a full trial, it is Rs 3,000 per case. “It is highly illegal and unethical on the lawyers to demand money from such clients. How can they demand money from a woman who has approached the court to get maintenance from her husband so that she and her children might have at least two meal a day,” Justice S Vimala, a former judge of the Madras high court, said. “If they feel that the amount is less, it the authorities with whom they should fight, and should not demand money from poor,” she said. I Jayanthi, secretary of the Chennai District Legal Service Aid (DLSA) said that the legal aid lawyers have for long been seeking revision of the fee. “Though we address such complaints on time, we also need to look at the larger issue, which is the fact that these lawyers are paid too less for a case. It’s high time the rates are revised,” she said. "

",Delhi violence: People picking up the pieces amid tight security,"NEW DELHI: A week after the communal violence in northeast Delhi, the residents are slowly picking up the pieces as the government's relief and rehabilitation measures have kicked in amid tight vigil by security forces. The police have been conducting flag marches and holding meetings with the locals in Jafrabad, Maujpur, Babarpur, Chand Bagh, Shiv Vihar, Bhajanpura, Yamuna Vihar and Mustafabad where the violence, that sparked from protests over the amended Citizenship Act, was the most intense. In Mustafabad, an Eidgah has been turned into a relief camp, and the locals too have also opened their homes for those seeking shelter. Many families have been sought refuge at the relief camps in Mustafabad and Shri Ram Colony, with others preferring their relative's house. Students are appearing for board exams that were postponed in riot-affected areas with the police and paramilitary personnel maintaining a tight vigil outside the centres. However, government schools in the area will remain closed till March 7. Some people are visiting their burnt out homes to assess the damage. Many of those who fled during the violence are still fearful about returning and say that they would wait for a week more before deciding anything. The Delhi Police has registered 436 FIRs and arrested or detained 1,427 people in connection with the communal violence that claimed 42 lives and left over 200 injured. an officer had said on Tuesday, adding 45 cases were registered under the Arms Act. The situation in the riot-affected areas was under control and the police control room (PCR) have not received calls regarding rioting in the past six days, the force said.

Sisodia described last week’s violence as the result of the “failure of the law and order authorities”. “Patrolling is going on,” the deputy CM said. “The sub-divisional magistrates are also taking details from the people in localities where violence took place. Even I have come here to see for myself how the people are living and how the compensation effort is proceeding. It is very sad to see the sights in these lanes.” He commended both the Hindu and Muslim residents of Shiv Vihar for protecting each other’s homes. Sisodia emphasised on confidence building measures. “You can be at peace since police patrolling is going on regularly. Please be assured that the situation is normal,” he said. One of the houses that Sisodia entered belonged to Nawab Ali, 44, a school cab driver. His two storeyed building was burnt down and his vehicle set ablaze last Tuesday. “Police rescued us late in the day,” he told TOI. He was able to return home only this week. Several NGO workers and government officials helped people who had lost all documents in fires fill out compensation applications. The officials assured them that the photos of their damaged homes would be enough for them to get their claims. “We have given households the forms, and after complete assessment we will give them the compensation amounts,” said Sisodia, who was accompanied by the legislator from Mustafabad, Haji Yunus, and ACP Brahmjeet Singh. Yunus, who also visited the Eidgah relief camp, assured the riot victims that they could go back to their homes and that the state government had asked the municipal corporation to clear the roads of rubble. “To claim compensation, people need not give us copies of the FIR,” the minister said. “We are trying to bring back peace as soon as possible so that the people can return to their homes.” Food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain was also at Brijpuri area to oversee distribution of food by Delhi government. He said, “We are also making sure that people open their shops because this will bring normalcy back in the district.” Kundan, an NGO volunteer, confirmed that the government was collaborating with civil society to ensure expedited delivery of relief material and compensation.

According to police, there were 222 calls from the district of outer Delhi, 168 from Rohini, 22 from outer North, 54 from North West Delhi, while there were 35 such calls from central Delhi, six each from North Delhi and East Delhi, and four from Shahdara. Another 30 calls were made from South West Delhi. All these calls were made between 7pm and 9pm on Sunday, said Delhi police PRO MS Randhawa. Earlier on Monday, police officials had put the distress call figure at over 3,000, saying police stations and officials also got several calls directly from citizens panicked by the rumours. Twenty-one people were arrested in northwest Delhi, 18 in south Delhi and one in Rohini,” police said. Asking people not believe in rumors, police commissioner S N Shrivastava said: “Some anti-national elements and miscreants want to disturb peace and harmony in the city by rumour mongering. Delhi Police has been pro-actively countering such misnformation and taking strict legal action. I appeal to people of Delhi to not fall for any fake news and verify information from police.” On Sunday, there was a stampede-like situation at many places and some Metro stations had to be shut as rumours were spread in a coordinated fashion. However, the Delhi police was quick to take to social media and deny any incident, which brought the situation in control in time. Meanwhile, Delhi Police has filed 369 FIRs pertaining to last week’s riots. Over 1,284 people have been arrested or detained as preventive measures. Forty-four FIRs have been registered under the Arms Act for use of illegal weapons in the riots. The cyber cell is learnt to have filed 21 FIRs and over 100 accounts are under watch. In order to restore complete normalcy in the area, 76 Aman Committee meetings have been held with elderly and religious leaders of different communities. "

","LG Anil Baijal visits northeast Delhi, assesses situation","NEW DELHI: Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Monday briefed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah over the violence in northeast Delhi last week, which left at least 47 dead and over 250 injured. Sources said Baijal was summoned by the PM to brief him about the situation in northeast Delhi and the preventive steps being taken by Delhi government and local police. The LG reviewed law and order situation in the violence-hit area with Delhi’s additional chief secretary (home) and the police commissioner, before visiting Karawal Nagar, Chand Bagh and Brijpuri to take stock. The LG also interacted with locals. “We should prioritise bringing back peace to restore normalcy,” Baijal said and directed the cops to continue deployment and take effective measures to counter rumour mongers.

",One-third of married women in India experience spousal violence: Study,"NEW DELHI: Almost one-third of all married women in India have experienced spousal violence with Wife-beating accepted by many women, says a study which calls gender-based violence as one of the most serious concerns in the country. The study was conducted by Vadodara-based NGO 'SAHAJ' in collaboration with 'Equal Measures 2030', a global partnership of nine civil society and private sector organisations with its secretariat in the United Kingdom. Citing data from the National Family Health Survey (NHFS) 4, SAHAJ came out with a report which said about 27 per cent of women aged 15 to 49 years have experienced physical violence since the age of 15 years. ""On one hand, India shows strong economic growth and on the other hand, it lags far behind in achieving equitable development amongst individuals facing discrimination based on caste, class or gender,"" said the report titled 'Fiscal Underpinnings of Gender Equity Health, Nutrition and Welfare Programs for Women'. ""Almost one-third of all married women in India have experienced spousal violence and wife-beating is accepted by many women,"" it said. The report said ""patriarchal attitudes"" are deeply entrenched in the minds of people, which are reflected in ""discriminatory attitudes towards girl and women, and a view of women largely through a reproductive role"". It also raised concern over the fact that ""Indian girls receive less education, have poorer nutrition and get less medical attention than boys"". As a result of these social norms and ongoing issues in implementing bold policies, there are a number of areas where the country continues to face challenges in promoting equality for girls and women, the report said. ""For instance, despite the existence of initiatives such as Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, pervasive patriarchal attitudes continue to undermine the social status of women, contributing to poor health and mortality outcomes for girls and worsening sex ratios at birth,"" it said. Likewise, though significant progress has been seen in establishing new legislation and policies to promote the rights of girls and women in areas such as political leadership and economic participation, many of these commitments have yet to translate into tangible outcomes, it said. Thus, to realistically achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), India needs more concerted efforts and synergistic approach for including women in all spheres of development, the report added. "

",Ration violence rocks Murshidabad,"Behrampore/Kolkata: Violence and arson were reported from at least four areas of Murshidabad on Saturday as ration card holders accused dealers of malpractice. The governor took cognizance of the allegation and asked the state government to weed out “corruption” in the public distribution system. Deprived PDS beneficiaries allegedly lit a fire using kerosene in front of a dealer’s house-cum-shop at Punashi under Shimulia gram panchayat in Salar. A large contingent of cops rushed to the spot and quelled the protest. Later, police also detained accused PDS dealer Halim Seikh Sarkar. People at Krishnapur in Lalgola complained that ration dealer Kayem Sheikh and his henchmen pelted stones and bricks from the rooftop, targeting beneficiaries, when he was accused of distributing essentials of substandard quality. Five reportedly sustained head injuries. Kayem dubbed it a conspiracy. At Fatepur, also in Lalgola, residents organized an agitation against PDS dealer Rabiul Islam for allegedly distributing adulterated rice. It is learnt additional SP Tanmoy Sarkar had to rush to three spots in Lalbag to pacify protesters. The dealers told police they were not receiving stocks to last a month, as announced by the chief minister, while customers were pressuring them for distribution of the same. In all the incidents, preliminary police reports suggest the opposition’s role in “instigating beneficiaries”. However, in Ward 20 of Trinamool-run Jangipur Municipality, the party faction opposing the civic chairman organized an ag-itation against dealer Rahamat Sheikh. It is led by the local TMC councillor. State food minister Jyotipriya Mullick blamed BJP and Congress for Saturday’s violence. “As many as 63,69,406 people have received ration. Some people (owing allegiance to opposition parties) targeted ration shops in Murshidabad even before they opened. Nevertheless, as many as 271 ration dealers have been taken to task,” he said. Mullick maintained that although the PM had announced free ration on March 25, the state was yet to get its entire rice quota. Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Chowdhury, on the other hand, urged beneficiaries to check if they were getting rice in adequate quantity and of good quality. “People are supposed to get the Swarna variety of rice. They are instead receiving a substandard variety. The public distribution system in Bengal has become corrupt. If leaders of the ruling party are given a free hand to collect money from dealers, why won’t beneficiaries agitate amid lockdown?” the Behrampore MP said. "

",Delhi: Life returning to normal with shops open and traffic stalling,"NEW DELHI: Life in violence-affected areas of northeast Delhi limped back to normalcy on Saturday with several shops and establishments resuming their businesses and people coming back to work. Locals came out of their homes to buy groceries, fruits and other items of daily needs. After several days of the stretch remaining deserted, traffic jam was reported on the main road leading to Maujpur, Kardampur and Yamuna Vihar. Meanwhile, police and paramilitary personnel maintained strict vigil in the northeast Delhi areas. They were deputed at every nook and corner to avoid any confrontation. Minority commission teams visited Maujpur and Jafrabad. Jahangir Ali, resident of Moonga Nagar in Chand Bagh, accompanied his daughter, Iqra, who was returning from her school in Tis Hazari. “I didn’t let her go to school for six days because the situation was not suitable. Life is more important than anything else. On Saturday I decided to accompany her. I pray for things to get normal as riots have never served anyone’s purpose,” said Ali, with worry writ large on his face. Sultan Singh, another resident of Chand Bagh, opened his confectionery shop for the first time after Monday. “All hell had broken loose in the area during the violence. People were mindlessly pelting stones at each other. Fearing my shop also getting targeted, I had decided to down the shutters,” said Singh. In Mustafabad also, things are back to normal. Anshul Jain, running a general store in Mustafabad area, cannot stop thanking god for saving his shop from rioters. “Like others, I had also locked my shop on Sunday evening. The rioters burnt all shops in this lane, but failed to unlock my shop so it was saved from getting burnt. On Saturday, I decided to re-open it after assessing the situation in the area,” said Jain. A team from SDM office reached Shiv Vihar, Kardampuri and other areas for property damage assessment. “We are also distributing forms to the affected people so that instant relief of Rs 25,000 can be given,” said an official. Delhi government had earlier promised cash incentive to people who lost their houses in violence. At Kardampuri, government staff were found approaching people in internal lanes to know their requirement for food and water. Compared with Friday, the areas looked much cleaner. “For past six days, garbage was not being lifted as sanitation staff were not visiting the areas out of fear. On Saturday, debris and other materials were removed from the main road and garbage was lifted at some colonies. However, the situation in internal lanes is still bad,” claimed Kardampuri resident Shaukat Ali. A few minor incidents have, however, come to fore and police are probing them. In Kardampuri, one Naeem alleged that he was thrashed on Friday night while he was returning from his factory. (With inputs from Mohammad Ibrar, Sakshi Chand)"

","Delhi: They kept rioters out, preserved amity","NEW DELHI: While communal tension gripped Maujpur, less than a kilometre away, Babarpur village kept hostility at bay, with the Hindu and Muslim residents living as neighbours deciding not to be provoked into senseless violence. “On Monday, when news of stone pelting emanated from Maujpur, senior citizens immediately called a meeting and asked the residents here not to allow outsiders entry into the village,” disclosed area resident Ajay Sharma. “We also decided to nab any suspicious people and hand them over to the residents’ welfare association or the local police.” Sharma’s neighbour and childhood friend Waseem Khan joined the conversation to add, “Some people claimed that Muslim houses were being targeted elsewhere in northeast Delhi and that we should join the protests. But we didn’t give heed to such talk, opting instead to say at home.” While the cops began patrolling the area, the residents took it upon themselves to take the rounds of the village in batches, especially at night. “Our only objective was to keep goons or anti-socials away from our area. We were worried that the harmony shared by the people here would be affected by the presence of such people,” said Desh Raj. Social life in Babarpur has been marked by communal amity. Mohammad Imran shared how all Muslims keenly wait to partake of the bhandara organised every year at the local temple and how dishes prepared during the Eid celebration are distributed to all Hindu houses. Mangu Singh affirmed that his Muslim landlord was very protective about his family. “I saw a few tenants in my neighbourhood collecting stones to deal with any unforeseen incident, but I convinced them that no violence would take place here,” said Singh. In Mustafabad, amid the hatred, chaos and violence, this spirit of amity was in evidence at the Mankameshwar Mandir. Muslims sacrificed sleep the whole night to protect the Shiva temple from attacks by rioters. They also assisted Hindus employees of a sweet shop to leave the area when rioting broke out. The mandir is surrounded by Muslim residences. As soon as reports of vandalism at a mosque in Ashok Vihar started being circulated, the residents became angry, “But we didn’t let anyone attack the temple,” claimed carpenter Mohammad Khalid. “Most of those indulging in violence were people from outside our localities. It was our responsibility to make sure our Hindu brothers and sisters did not face hostility.” Harikant Sharma, the son of temple priest Indradev Shastri, commended the act of the local Muslims. “It was the Muslims who ensured our safety and protected the temple,” he corroborated. “Policemen were nowhere to be seen during all this, and if not for the locals we don’t know what could have happened.” Mukesh Kumar, who runs a sweet shop in Mustafabad, expressed gratefulness at how the local Muslims alerted him to the violence in the nearby areas on Monday and helped him reach his home in Nand Nagri. “I have never seen anything like this before. I can’t even imagine how it all began,” said Mukesh, who returned to Mustafabad on Saturday to open his shop and meet with the locals. "

",Delhi clashes: Man in viral clip who was asked to sing national anthem is dead,"NEW DELHI: A video that went viral during the violence in northeast Delhi showed five men being thrashed and forced to sing the national anthem by seven policemen in riot gear. TOI has identified three of the five victims. One died in hospital, while two are recovering from injuries. Faizan, who ran a chicken shop, died while being treated in hospital. His younger brother, Naeem, identified Faizan as the man in the video lying unconscious. The family alleged that police kept him in custody for two days. “When we were finally summoned to take him home, Faizan couldn’t walk or speak and through signs indicated that he was in great pain,” said Naeem. “We took him to the hospital where he died. It has been four days since but the hospital authorities haven’t handed his body to us.” At Faizan’s house in Kardampuri, a crowd awaited the return of the family with his body so the last rites could be conducted. Naeem told TOI, “On Monday (February 24), my brother reached home around 4pm but went out gain to check on our mother, who was at the protest site. My mother returned home, but my brother apparently stayed back to protect the women protesters when police resorted to firing teargas shells.” The family accused police of picking Faizan from the protest site and thrashing him. “He was taken to hospital later and then brought back to Jyoti Nagar police station,” said Naeem. “Police did not permit us to meet him there. On February 26, they informed us to come and take him home. By then he was unable to speak. Faizan told me the cops had beaten him badly. We took him for medical aid, but he succumbed to his injuries.” Faizan was taken to GTB Hospital and discharged the same day. His family was informed. Two days later he returned to the hospital, where he died, said a police officer. The second man in the video, painter Kaushar Ali, 45, lives two lanes from Faizan’s house. He was at work in Gandhi Nagar when police took him in and battered him. His son, Tahir, alleged, “My father was returning from work on Monday when the cops thrashed him and made him sing Jana Gana Mana. He fractured his hand and leg and has injuries on his head and abdomen.” Tahir said his father was the one in the video with the head of another man on his chest. That other man is Rafiq, who lives in the same locality as Ali. Outside Rafiq’s residence, his brother, Aamir, stood with folded hands pleading with journalists to leave them alone. “We do not want anything, and I am glad my brother is alive. Yes, it is him in the video being made to sing the national anthem by the police officers,” said Aamir. Aamir stated that his brother, a tailor, was picked up near his house and taken to the other side of the road where he was beaten with a stick. “We have been living here after coming to Delhi from Lucknow,” he said. He claimed not to be aware why Rafiq was picked up and assaulted by the cops. He said the family did not know the other men seen in the video. Two videos of this incident went viral on social media. One was recorded at close range, and the other filmed by an area resident from his roof. In the close-up video, the police officers can be seen asking the five people to sing the national anthem properly. They also ask one of them what kind of drugs he took. An officer can be heard brusquely saying, “Sing the national anthem and Vande Matram. You have stayed in Hindustan but want azadi. You throw stones at the security forces.” The officers can also be heard constantly abusing the five men. "

They are also urging residents to not pay attention to rumours on social media and report them to the police. Sources, meanwhile, said the Delhi government is considering to issue a WhatsApp number on which people can complain about hate messages being circulated on the instant messaging app. They said the government will make an appeal to people to not forward any such message because forwarding any material which causes enmity amongst communities is a crime. The move is aimed at dealing with rumours on social media. Relatives of riot victims continued to wait outside the mortuary at GTB Hospital to receive bodies. The violence in Jafrabad, Maujpur, Babarpur, Chandbagh, Shiv Vihar, Bhajan Pura, Yamuna Vihar areas of northeast Delhi has claimed at least 42 lives and left over 200 injured.

The tweet in Hindi says that ‘Domestic Violence is Thappad, Mental Abuse is Thappad’. The tweet gives out the helpline numbers to report such cases and is accompanied with a picture of actor Tapsee Pannu from the movie with a line ‘just a slap, par nahi maar sakta’. The tweet was appreciated by many, including the lead actor of the movie Tapsee, who shared it on her timeline. The movie’s director Anubhav Sinha also retweeted it and actor Rahul Dev called it a ‘great initiative’ on social media. The tweet from Rajasthan Police’s verified account also said that domestic abuse can be reported at helpline numbers 1090 and 112 as well as at the nearest police station. The tweet was posted on Thursday and within 24 hours received thousands of mixed reactions. The post used multiple hashtags and tagged not only the moviemakers, but also organisations working for women. While most of the replies to the tweet were appreciable and talked about the influence of cinema in today’s age, there were a few Twitter users who questioned it and claimed that even men are victims of domestic violence, but cops never mention it. Some of them said while police are campaigning against domestic violence, in many instances, action is not taken despite cases being registered. Those trolling the tweet claimed that the laws were gender-biased and no action is taken in those cases where women are the perpetrators. Sinha’s latest movie is centered around the normalisation of domestic violence in India which inspired the state police to take to social media to urge people to report such matters. "

",Delhi: Shaheen Bagh women grieve for the riot-hit,"NEW DELHI: A sharpened need for their own security, a shared grief with “families who lost their sons” in the northeast Delhi violence and some disappointment that the case was deferred to March 23 marked the first reactions at Shaheen Bagh after Supreme Court said it did not find the climate conducive to proceed on the road-closure case. “Supreme Court took the decision recognising the circumstances. It had already recognised our right to protest. In the current situation, if only SC had also seen it fit to say something about our own protection,” said Ritu Kaushik on the 75th day of the women’s protest on Thursday. The report from SC on Wednesday had brought the women to their feet. After a cathartic spell of Delhi Police hai hai and Amit Shah hai hai, the men and women collapsed back into position, grieving the “riots and attacks” in northeast Delhi where some have family and friends. “How many mothers must see sons killed for politicians to gain?” asked Fatima. From the stage, Amna Faheem tried to calm frayed tempers: “This fight is not of religion and it will not be allowed to become one despite all efforts. People of all faiths are here and we grieve for all who are shaheed in the violence.” Notably, the elder men were also out, taking to the stage to share animal parables that talk peace and humanity. “All youth have to be guided.” Fear in their heart, steel in their eyes and message of peace on their lips, Shaheen Bagh spent Wednesday afternoon in dua, a tentful of people in quiet prayer. The chatter centred on the lives lost and grieving families. “The instigators, the ones behind it, will all have to answer god — call him allah, call him bhagwan.” Talking of the massive 2019 victory for Modi-led BJP, Bushaira Parveen said: “Vote dene ka sazaa hai ye? (Is this what we get for voting them?” The violence came as a body blow. “This is what they will do? They keep talking population. So, kill some, nullify documents of some, chase people out by destroying their homes and documents and those who are left, keep them under their thumb,” said a woman, who had returned from visiting the affected families in Jafrabad. “They should know the public is against riots. That is a fact.” Kehkeshan Riyaz said: “One Kapil Mishra wreaked havoc. Imagine how many Kapil Mishras would have been born had the Ayodhya verdict been in our favour.” After every outburst, they returned to talk of their protest and the necessity to secure the “sanctuary of peace”. “What has happened is that their misrule and kala kanoon has brought Hindus and Muslims closer. That they cannot tolerate,” said Bushaira. “The plan was to fatigue us out. Let this linger, the women will get tired. The idea is to crush the andolan. We held together through very difficult days, we shall continue,” said Zia Bano. They are wary for their own security. “Should we not be given adequate security?” Shaheen Kauser said, “Police in places is playing a role in worsening the social fabric,” but refused to paint all police with the same brush. “Yahan ki police seem more responsible,” is the general sentiment. “We have no expectation from any government now,” said one, while Kauser added, “Our only hope lies with Supreme Court.” On AAP government, Riyaz said, “In our situation, we cannot trust political parties. But we plan to call Amanatullah Khan, our MLA, here and ask him if (CM) Kejriwal will pass a resolution against CAA and announce there will be no NPR.” Kauser said, “We will not accept the new format.” "

There are only tears in the house today. The 35-year-old was shot dead during the riots and his body discovered at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital on Thursday. Imrana held the 15-day-old Inaya, named so by her husband Mudassar, and wept continuously on Friday. She has seven other daughters, not all of them of an age to understand the tragedy that has struck the family. Kesar Jahan, Mudassar’s mother, sorrowfully said, “Look at the faces of these children. The younger ones don’t even know what has happened. Who will secure their future now?” The eldest daughter, just 14 years old, mumbled, “It was my birthday on February 14, and papa gifted me a gown.” Yusuf Khan, younger brother of the deceased plastics manufacturing businessman, described Mudassar as a ‘problem solver’. “My brother had gone to Kardampuri for some work on Monday. He got stuck there and told me about the outbreak of violence. I asked him to stay indoors until the situation improved. The following day he called in the morning. He was worried at the escalating situation and asked me to come and accompany him back home.” Yusuf reached the Brijpuri bridge, where he found rioters from both communities furiously throwing stones at each other. “I called my brother repeatedly but he did not answer his phone. I was really afraid. Then the phone was answered by a stranger who said my brother had been lying dead on the road and a man driving a Tata 407 had left his body at GTB Hospital.” The family took the help of a local politician and the station house officer to reach the hospital and claim his body. Teary-eyed and lost, Mudassar’s father muttered, “He had a gunshot wound on his head. He was a responsible son.” Even though a large contingent of security officials was deployed in the area on Friday, the residents did not feel secure. “The situation is tense and we venture out of our houses only for a couple of hours,” said Yusuf. “People of both communities live in the locality and we had never faced this horrible situation. In fact, the locals say it was unfamiliar outsiders who created havoc.” "

","Delhi riots: People wait at hospitals, hoping for the best, expecting the worst","NEW DELHI: Days after the violence in northeast Delhi ebbed, many families are still searching for relatives who went missing during the riotous days. Some have located their bodies in hospitals, which have reported 42 deaths till Friday. Others are still ding the rounds. Delhi violence: Live updatesAutorickshaw driver Babbu, 35, left home in Bhajanpura’s Sri Ram Colony on Tuesday afternoon, but was thrashed with iron rods by a mob a short distance away. “Before leaving, he told us that he would take his auto elsewhere and not ply in the locality to avoid the violence,” his uncle Shami Ahmed said. “We tried to stop him, but he argued that if he didn’t go he could not earn money which was necessary because the situation was uncertain.” The body of 30-year-old Monis was identifi ed by his brother at GTB HospitalTwo hours after going out, a family acquaintance informed them that Babbu had been found in a pool of blood, his vehicle in flames, and he had been taken first to Jag Pravesh Hospital and then to GTB hospital. He was dead when they reached the hospital. Babbu is survived by a mentally impaired wife and three children. Ahmed, like most of the people TOI spoke to at the mortuary in the past four days, hesitated to reveal the full names of the deceased and the family members. On Friday, many such people anxiously waited outside GTB Hospital to take back the bodies of their loved ones. The body of 30-year-old Monis was identified in the morning by his brother. He claimed that he had made at least 10 rounds to the mortuary in the last three days to find his brother but was not allowed to see the unidentified bodies. Today, after finally being permitted entry, he found his brother’s body. Dilshad’s wife is yet to locate him“When we came to the mortuary, we were told no one of that description was there. We were asked to check at AIIMS, Lok Nayak and Safdarjung hospitals. We visited these places, but didn’t find Monis’ body,” said the brother. “We did not go to the police station to lodge a missing person complaint because our neighbours warned us that the cops would only lock us up if we approached them and other things of that sort.” A distressed woman was yet to locate her missing husband. “Dilshad is nowhere to be found,” a frantic Farha said. “He left home on Tuesday morning and there’s been no contact with him since. We have five children. I am at my wit’s end.” "

",On a wing & a prayer: People run from pillar to post to trace missing relatives,"NEW DELHI: Five days after riots broke out in several parts of northeast Delhi, several families are still searching for their missing members. Most of them have already checked the hospitals, assuming they would find their near and dear ones either in the emergency block or at least in the mortuary, but to no avail. Delhi violence: Live updatesIn Mustafabad, the missing people include a college student from Ghaziabad who had come to appear for an exam but was yet to return home. Mansi Gupta’s relatives have circulated her picture on WhatsApp and other social media platforms but there has been no positive response so far. Vipin Goyal, the uncle of the 20-year-old woman, said the situation was still tense and more so for them. “On Monday, my niece came to appear for an exam at Shyamlal college. She stays in Khoda but her sister resides in Shiv Vihar. On Monday, she wanted to visit her grandfather in Mustafabad but never reached his house. Initially, we thought she must have changed her plan but she can’t be traced since then,” said Goyal. Family members said that though police were approached soon, they could not do much. “We then tried to go to the Gokulpuri police station but couldn’t because of the curfew. Finally a case was registered in Ghaziabad,” Goyal said. Gupta’s relatives are also constantly trying to call her but her phone is coming switched off. Hamza Gyasuddin Ansari (25), a roadside vendor on 25 Foota Road in Mustafabad, has also been missing since Wednesday.

He said he would come later but never reached home. We went to the Gokulpuri police station but they did not hear us out. We dialled the emergency number found at Al Hind Hospital but there was no response. We checked other hospitals, too, but did not find him anywhere.” Another family member said they had submitted a written complaint to police. They have also prepared a poster with Ansari’s photo and details, and circulated it on the social media, but they are yet to hear from anybody. "

",Delhi riots: BSF jawan’s house among those torched,"NEW DELHI: Among the scores whose houses were targeted by mobs over the last few days is BSF jawan Mohammad Anees. Currently stationed in Odisha, Anees told TOI over the phone that it was his father, Mohammad Munees, who was at their home in Khajuri Khas Gali No. 5 with a relative when all hell broke loose. Chand alias Guddu, the younger of the two brothers, was also out station with the rest of the family. When TOI caught up with him on Friday, Chand said: “Even as tension escalated, my father refused to leave the locality in the belief that police will protect them.” On February 25, as a mob tried to force its way into the house, Munees tried to reason with them, but to no avail. As things appeared to be getting out of hand, some relatives whisked Munees and his relative away to their place in the nearby Chandu Nagar. When police did arrive the next day, their house had already been burned down to ashes, Chand said, adding that the house next door, belonging to a Sikh family, was spared. At Chandu Nagar, where hundreds of families from Khureji Khas have taken refuge, there is a strong sense of anger. “Anees bhai fought for the country on the borders, but they (the mob) didn’t think twice before burning down his home,” said Mohammad Saleem, a neighbour who has also moved out temporarily.

",Delhi riots: Colony with 60 houses opens doors to strangers,"NEW DELHI: Over the last few days, Chandu Nagar, a small neighbourhood in northeast Delhi has become a “temporary” refugee colony. Each one of the 60 houses here has virtually been converted into a bunker, well-stocked with essentials and medicines. The colony’s entry point has been barricaded with bamboo sticks and young men keep a watchful eye on outsiders. But despite the restrictions on entry, residents of the area are a welcoming lot, having opened their hearts and homes to over 800 strangers from Chand Bagh and Khajuri Khas. These newcomers to the colony are victims of riots that have left behind a trail of destruction in the past few days. When TOI visited the neighbourhood, Mohammad Ishaq and his wife, Nasreena, had been living there for the last three days. As mobs ran amok, the couple suspected that they would be the next target. They just had a few seconds to decide the next course of action. They used that time to convince their eldest daughter and son to flee to their paternal aunt’s house. They could not escape with their children because of their youngest son, two-year-old Liyan, and the elderly in the family. “We took our children to the terrace and they climbed on to other people’s rooftops to escape the area,” Nasreen said. The 35-year-old has not had a chance to meet her children since then. “We have spoken to them on phone. But we have not seen them for the last five days because nobody can leave their homes. We feel extremely unsafe,” said Nasreen. According to the couple, they only managed to escape later in the day when several men from the neighbouring Chandu Nagar came to their colony aided by policemen. “When we heard about the attack, we made several calls to the police. When the cops finally arrived, we accompanied them to aid the rescue operation,” said Ikramul Haque. Haque, a government official with Food Corporation of India, also opened his house to several families, one of them Nasreen’s. As TOI spoke to Nasreen, her youngest stayed in her lap, clutching her dupatta, even while deep in sleep. Liyaz’s forehead bore a deep cut and a purple bruise, a testimony to the violence that the couple escaped. “As we were escaping, the mob started pelting stones in our direction. When the stone hit him and he started bleeding, I thought I would lose him,” said Nasreen. The two rooms in Haque’s house are now a safe haven for 21 people. He is not charging any rent. But Haque is not the only one doing this. Several others have opened their houses to complete strangers. Zakir Hussain, 35, a cloth manufacturer has four rooms in his small home. While his family occupies two rooms, he has sublet the other to a family whose house was gutted in the fire. The third room is filled with milk packets, which are crowdsourced through volunteers, NGOs and Khalsa Aid. A corner in the road has become an open kitchen, with everyone pitching in foodgrain and vegetables. Even though their houses lie just a kilometre away, most victims have not mustered the courage to go and see the fate of their residences. A group of men went on a march together to assess the damage but could not retrieve anything from the charred remains. Mohammad Salim, a parking contractor, was one of them. He had escaped with just the clothes on his back. The 22-year-old said he was unsure of going back home “as the friends who I played cricket with, came and attacked my home”. “One of them put petrol on my father. It is just luck and the help from the police that he survived,” he said. But amid the despair, the young are determined to reclaim their lives. Fifteen-year-old Laiba is one of them. The teenager, who is to appear for her Class X boards, has got a duplicate admit card and is determined to take her examination. “It’s my father’s wish that I become an IAS officer. I will work towards that. The country needs honest people in the administration,” she said. "
