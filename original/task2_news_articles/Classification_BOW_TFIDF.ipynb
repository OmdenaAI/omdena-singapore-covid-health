      "\n",
      "In a battle that has spanned over the last decade, a retired chief commissioner of income tax (I-T) and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) have been at loggerheads over water charges in the former’s property tax bill. And now, bringing the citizen civic body disagreement to a head, PMC has slapped a notice of property attachment on 70-year-old Undri resident AJ Khan for unpaid tax dues of many years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entire tussle was sparked after the former I-T chief commissioner had pointed out that PMC’s water pipeline has not yet reached his area, questioning why residents were still being charged for water under property tax bills. In this light, he had also sent a legal notice to the civic body in 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday last week, however, he finally received his response. A notice for property attachment was directly pasted outside his bungalow in Paradise Villa complex dated December 27, 2019, asking Khan to pay Rs 10,36,104 within 15 days of notice’s issuance date.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan (inset) moved into a Paradise Villa bungalow in 2010; he sent legal notices to PMC in 2018, 2019 to omit water charges from his property tax\n",
      "However, Khan has decided to go ahead and fight a legal battle against PMC, saying his stand is clear — the corporation has been charging for water it is not providing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan narrated that he moved into the bungalow complex on NIBM-Undri Road in 2010, after he retired from his top post out of Pune’s I-T office. Speaking to Mirror, he shared, “After moving here, I realised that there was no water supply from PMC in our area. We were forced to be totally dependent on private water tankers for daily supply. While I was getting over the shock of the civic body not providing this essential resource, in October 2010, I got a property tax bill from PMC, divided under various headers of services we had to pay for. One of the categories was water supply charges. I took objection to this and soon wrote a complaint letter to PMC, stating that it should ideally remove water supply charges from the overall tax.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The former I-T chief commissioner claimed he did not receive any reply from officials about this complaint. “Even though I was ignored, I persisted and kept on filing complaints. Years later, in 2016, I managed to meet then-PMC commissioner Kunal Kumar, who assured me that my grievances would be addressed,” said Khan.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to him, a couple of days after meeting Kumar, a team of PMC employees from the water department visited their area and carried out a survey. “Thereafter, I received a letter from PMC saying it would take two years for their water pipelines to reach our locality,” added Khan.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, even after a wait of two years, there was no sign of PMC’s water pipeline in his locality, after which Khan finally sent a legal notice to the civic body in 2018. “The notice was addressed to the PMC commissioner, but there was no response. I waited for some time and sent yet another notice to PMC in August this year,” said the septuagenarian.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this time, the response he got was the property attachment notice. “I was shocked to see it pasted outside my bungalow. PMC has asked me to pay over Rs 10 lakh, which includes the outstanding property tax and interest on it. This is such arrogant behaviour — sending me a notice instead of addressing the issue and providing water to us which we pay for!” he emphasised.\n",
      "\n",
      "When contacted about the development, PMC property tax department head Vilas Kanade reasoned, “The civic administration collects tax as per decisions taken in the general body meeting. While we impose tax in areas where there is inadequate water supply, we apply a concessional rate there as compared to other city areas. As far as this case is concerned, I will look into it and try to help him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan further clarified that he is in no way against paying property tax, but merely wishes to have water charges removed. “I am ready to pay the rest. If I do not have a PMC water pipeline yet, why should I pay for the resource they are not providing?” he challenged.\n",

emergency...ICMR-AIIMS emergency mobile service initiative sees expansion By Medical Dialogues BureauPublished On 1 Jan 2020 11:10 AM GMT  |  Updated On  1 Jan 2020 11:10 AM GMTNew Delhi: People living within a 5-km radius of the AIIMS can now avail an emergency mobile medical service in case of anyone suffering heart attack or chest pain with the authorities expanding the initiative''s reach, officials said.The facility, a joint initiative of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), was launched in April and was earlier available within an radius of 3 km.Under ''Mission DELHI'' (Delhi Emergency Life Heart-Attack Initiative), a pair of motorcycle-borne trained paramedic nurses are the first responders for treating heart attack patients.The initiative has so far received 44 cases.\"The project has now been extended to 78 sq km around AIIMS, New Delhi and will now cater to a population of 20-25 lakhs in the national capital,\" Dr Chandni Suvarna, a scientist at AIIMS, said.On receiving a call at Mission Delhi''s toll-free emergency helpline numbers (1800111044 and 14430), the mobile medical nurse team is dispatched immediately for examining the patient, providing necessary medication/CPR, transmitting ECG to consultant at AIIMS.While the emergency treatment is being provided, a CATS ambulance will arrive and take the patient for further treatment.Even as the patient is on way to the hospital, doctors at AIIMS control centre will evaluate the data received from the nurses to establish further course of treatment.The ICMR has signed a memorandum with CATS (Centralized Ambulance Trauma Services) for this project.\"With bike-ambulances and trained nurses, Mission Delhi focuses on the importance of reaching with the medical help much faster, timely response and doorstep care saving the heart in time, given the high-density traffic conditions in the city where the movement of four-wheeler ambulances becomes difficult,\" Suvarna said.An ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) heart attack is an acute, high risk, time-sensitive life-threatening disease. The management of STEMI heart attack patient requires treatment to be started within the golden hour (90 minutes) of the onset of symptoms and providing clot buster therapy to patient within 30 minutes of reaching the hospital.Delays in reaching hospital and initiation of clot-buster therapy are the major causes of deaths in STEMI heart attack patients.According to AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria, the idea has been tried in remote areas of the country but not specifically for reaching those with heart trouble. Guleria earlier said the attempt is to reach patients within 10 minutes.The heart is like a room that pumps blood to the entire body. Before the blood is pumped to the body, it is pumped to the walls of the heart through three pipes (coronary arteries). If any of these pipes are clogged by clot, the tissues in that part of the heart die.It is important to remove the clot that is stopping the blood flow. If the heart walls are damaged, they cannot be repaired. Clot busters are almost equal to angioplasty.The average age of the occurrence of cardiac arrest in the Indian population is 53 to 55 years, about 10 years less than in the United States and Europe where it is 63 or 64.Genetic predisposition is an important cause for this but, the high rates of smoking and chewing tobacco in India also contribute in a large way.Ninety per cent of chewing tobacco prevalence in the world is in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Young heart patients that doctors see mostly have problems associated with tobacco use.extended heart attack patients mobile emergency care Medical Dialogues BureauMedical Dialogues Bureau consists of a team of passionate medical/scientific writers, led by doctors and healthcare researchers.  Our team efforts to bring you updated and timely news about the important happenings of the medical and healthcare sector.

      "Ever since Parliament passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, earlier this month, India has seen widespread protests. These protests have involved political parties, civil society, and student groups, as well as large number of ordinary Muslim citizens. Many of these protests have been marred by violence, involving the destruction of public property and clashes between police and protesters.However, the police in many states have also been accused of using excessive force on protesters. In Uttar Pradesh, there are reports and allegations that the police targeted Muslim protesters, even attacking some Muslim neighbourhoods and houses. To be sure, there is another side to the story — Uttar Pradesh police officials have spoken of large, well-organised mobs, intent on violence, and armed with guns in some cases. Still, this is a good time to remember the findings from the Status of Policing in India report, released earlier this year by Common Cause and CSDS-Lokniti, which showed that the police in India suffers from inadequacies and biases which might lead to such behaviour. The report said that large sections of the police force are not trained to care about human rights, believed that use of violence is justified against criminal elements, and are more prejudiced against the Muslims in believing that the community was naturally prone towards committing crimes. The report is based on a survey conducted across 21 states.It showed that in Assam and Uttar Pradesh, two of the states which witnessed multiple protests in the last two weeks, 31% and 19% personnel never received training in human rights. Assam also tops the states in share of personnel who did not receive training in caste sensitisation and crowd control.Even among the personnel who received training in any of the three modules, a majority received the training only at the time of joining the police force. This study said that was also true for those who were in the police force for more than five years. (See Chart 1) The survey data further suggested an inherent prejudice existed among police personnel against various socio-religious communities, but largely against Muslims. For instance, when asked to what extent were people from several communities naturally prone towards committing crimes,  50% police personnel said Muslims were “very much” or “somewhat” naturally prone towards committing crimes. This figure was under 35% in case of Dalits, tribal communities, “upper-caste” Hindus and people from the other backward classes. (See Chart 2)Uttar Pradesh was among the eight states where a majority of the police personnel surveyed showed this bias against Muslims. It was the highest in Uttarakhand at 79%. Uttar Pradesh was also among the states where the survey found a majority of personnel having a similar prejudice against Dalits.The need for training in human rights also gains significance as the survey found a large number of police personnel had the inclination to use extrajudicial measures against criminals  over a legal trail. Three in every  four police personnel surveyed felt it was justified for the police to be violent towards criminals, while one in five felt that killing dangerous criminals was better than a legal trial. To be sure, more educated police personnel, who are more likely to be officers, were found to be more likely to believe that it was alright for the police to be violent towards criminals. (See Chart 3).\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Barely a month after Lokesh was born, he was diagnosed with Pure Red Cell Aplasia, a rare blood disorder. It was a bolt from the blue for his parents, B. Ravi, a daily wage labourer, and B. Surekha, a small-time tailor, especially since doctors warned them of the dangers unless he was put on medication, lifelong. Lokesh is now 17 and Surekha a widow — Ravi died of a heart attack in February 2017. Since Ravi’s death, it has been more difficult than ever to continue her son’s treatment on her ₹3,000 income, what with two other children — another son and a daughter — to look after. The four live in a government-sanctioned house in Abdullapurmet, Hayatnagar. She also gets ₹2,000 pension from the government, but even with that, managing daily expenses and Lokesh’s medical care has been nothing short of a struggle. Worse, she has to repay several outstanding loans. Due to the financial crisis, she had to dig into her lifetime savings and take more loans from relatives. Despite all of it, she could not continue paying her children’s school fees as a result of which her elder son had to drop out of school. Lokesh, too, had to discontinue education as teachers asked that he have someone by his side throughout the duration of school hours. Her daughter, however, continues going to a government school. “Lokesh’s medicines for a month cost around ₹4,000. He needs two rounds of blood transfusion too. We have to spend ₹1,000 to travel between home and the blood bank. I stopped taking loans as people started questioning how I intend to repay it. I request people to donate money for his treatment or buy us the medicines so that my son can live,” says Surekha. When at one point, Surekha could not afford to buy medicines for two months, Lokesh’s health started declining. “His iron levels increased and doctors said we have to continue the medicines to avoid further risks to his life. If someone helps us with our medical expenses, my son can be saved,” she adds, appealing for help.Those willing to donate money can send it to B. Surekha (Andhra Bank, Chikadpally branch, Hyderabad; bank account number: 007610100054512, IFSC: ANDB0000076) or contact her on 86867-29184. \n",

      "While many prefer to fly to an exotic destination on a holiday, Mr Kevin Raja and his family hit the road on a charity drive.\n",
      "They recently drove 5,403km over 12 days to help needy children in Cambodia.\n",
      "Leaving Singapore on Nov 28, Mr Kevin, 53, travelled with his wife, Mrs Selvarani, 51, and three of their children - Sacshi, 20, Ussha, 15, and Gobinesh, 12 - in a Mazda3 car.\n",

      "Their eldest son, Sakthi, 24, could not go because of work.\n",
      "\"I like long drives. Initially, I wanted to travel with my friends and make stops in Malaysia and Thailand for goodwill work. But because they couldn't make it, I decided to travel with my family,\" said Mr Kevin, who works as a regional data protection officer at Ace Stallion Consultancy.\n",
      "After driving six days through Alor Setar, Krabi, Surat Thani, Prachuap Khiri Khan and Bangkok, they reached Siem Reap in north-western Cambodia on Dec 3. It was a gruelling journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My car tyre went flat just an hour after entering Cambodia,\" said Mr Kevin. \"It was about 5pm, and the sunset was at 6pm. Since there were no street lights, my biggest fear was to stop at the roadside at night.\"\n",
      "Stranded 70km away from Siem Reap, he tried to repair the car with his tools but gave up as it took too long. He contacted Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and got in touch with Mr Weng Aow, a Singaporean warden in Siem Reap who volunteers for the Singapore Embassy in Phnom Penh.\n",
      "Mr Weng, who speaks both Khmer - Cambodia's official language - and English, said: \"When I got the call from Kevin, I was worried about the safety of his family. I advised him to stay in the car, keep the doors locked and the hazard lights on.\n",
      "\"The embassy had contacted mechanics to repair the car. I rushed to the spot, arriving earlier than the workers. It was good because I could bridge the language barrier and guide the mechanics.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Kevin said: \"Mr Weng consoled us in that stressful situation. After our car was repaired, he guided us to our hotel.\"\n",
      "Mr Weng later referred them to a non-profit Cambodian charity, Feeding Dreams Cambodia.\n",

      "The organisation supports more than 800 poor children and families living in Siem Reap's slums and runs a community school.\n",
      "On Dec 5, the family visited the school and interacted with a class of about 30 students. \"I wanted to make the children smile. We gave them two bags full of English storybooks,\" said Mr Kevin.\n",
      "Mrs Selvarani said the children were inquisitive and asked her about her \"pottu\", a red dot worn on the forehead by Hindu women.\n",
      "A nurse at Singapore's National University Hospital, she explained the significance of the pottu and put it on the foreheads of the girls.\n",
      "\"I cried when I heard the stories the teachers told us about the children,\" she said. \"Some are orphans, some are picked up from rubbish dumps. You can see some are underdeveloped from malnutrition.\"\n",
      "Mr Kevin and his family donated US$1,000 (S$1,345), including money from their friends.\n",
      "They also presented a plaque to Feeding Dreams Cambodia.\n",
      "\"Besides providing basic education, the organisation teaches work-related skills, such as in hotel management. Since Siem Reap is a popular tourist destination, it helps the students find jobs,\" said Mr Kevin.\n",
      "He and his wife intend to continue supporting Feeding Dreams Cambodia. The family returned to Singapore on Dec 9.\n",
      "\"The roads in Cambodia had potholes and were sandy. Although the journey was tough, we felt fulfilled. It has encouraged me to drive farther to other countries like Myanmar and India to spread goodwill,\" said Mr Kevin.\n",

      "Failing to make headway in the murder case of a 37-year-old jeweller, who was found dead in his Dwarka home last September, the Delhi Police has decided to conduct a narco analysis test on his wife and her brother at a lab in Gujarat’s Gandhi Nagar.\n",
      "On September 4, Lalit Aggarwal, owner of Satyam Jewellers, was found with his throat slit inside his bedroom. His eldest son was sleeping alongside him. Police said Aggarwal was dressed in formal clothes.\n",
      "He is survived by his wife Neha Aggarwal (34) and two sons, aged 14 and 9. His family claimed the assailants slipped away unnoticed after committing the crime.\n",
      "In their investigation so far, police have found that entry to the house was friendly and the house wasn’t ransacked. There were five people inside the house when the incident took place.\n",
      "“A few days ago, the investigation officer (IO) moved an application before Metropolitan Magistrate Ashish Kumar Meena in a Dwarka court to conduct a narco analysis test on suspect Neha and her brother. The IO also submitted affidavit of their consent. While granting permission, the court asked the IO to conduct the test in four weeks,” said a senior police officer.\n",
      "The move comes after police found contradictions in their statements. Using technical surveillance, police found that Neha’s brother was in the vicinity but had not told them about it.\n",
      "Neha had told The Indian Express, “After dinner around 10 pm, Lalit and our eldest son went to sleep. I went to sleep in the other room along with my sister, mother and our youngest son. Around 1 am, I woke up to go to the bathroom. I also went inside Lalit’s room and plugged in the mosquito repellent — everything was fine then. Around 2 am, my son came and told me his father woke him up but didn’t say anything, and that he saw blood near his father’s face. We went to the room and saw Lalit lying on the bed, unconscious and blood oozing from his neck.”\n",

      "The recent cases of rape and sexual harassment have shocked the conscience of the country. And the cry to set up more fast-track courts that can swiftly deal with these cases has been growing. In July 2019, the Centre had proposed a plan to set up 1,023 fast-track special courts (FTSCs) that would specifically deal with pending cases of rape and cases under the Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. As of March 31, 2018, there were 1,66,882 cases of rape and Pocso Act pending in trial courts across the country.\n",
      "Government has recently released a detailed plan laying out the implementation framework for the FTSCs scheme: states and UTs were given a cutoff date of December 31, 2019, within which they needed to communicate their concurrence for coming on board. Post the launch, FTSCs would be initially set up for a period of one year subject to further approval.\n",
      "Delay in disposal of cases is an issue of serious concern not just at the subordinate court level but at different appellate levels of the judiciary. But a lot of the government initiatives to fast-track cases in courts have primarily been focussed around the subordinate courts. To reduce delays, it is important that reforms should be introduced not only in subordinate courts but in high courts as well as in the Supreme Court.\n",
      "\n",
      "As per a reply submitted in Rajya Sabha in June 2019, close to 43 lakh cases are pending in HCs with nearly 8 lakh cases pending for more than a decade. Criminal cases arising from lower courts form a huge proportion in HCs too. As per the recent SC annual report, as of June 30, 2018, there were close to 7.5 lakh criminal appeals and criminal revision cases that were pending in HCs. Allahabad HC topped the chart followed by the Madhya Pradesh HC and the Punjab and Haryana HC.\n",
      "A similar trend can be seen even in the SC. Daksh’s study of the SC cases between January and November 2018 revealed that most number of judgments pertained to criminal matters, with cases taking 4.6 years on an average to get disposed. Hence, it is imperative that focus should be shifted towards all the tiers of the judiciary. To render complete justice cases of certain nature should be fast-tracked all the way up till the SC and until the final execution of the punishment.\n",
      "It must be noted that in the Nirbhaya case, the trial in the subordinate court was completed swiftly within 8 months and in the Delhi HC within a span of 6 months. However, it took the SC nearly 3 years to deliver the final verdict. And even though the apex court confirmed the death sentence in 2017, none of the convicts has been hanged till date. If the intention behind capital punishment is to deter future crimes, then why is there an inordinate delay in execution of the sentences? With delay being caused both from the judicial and the executive front, such deterrence is difficult to achieve.\n",
      "Another important measure that government needs to undertake is to make FTCs permanent in all the states. The non-permanent nature of the FTCs has been a persistent issue. The scheme was first introduced by the Centre in 2000 and FTCs continued functioning in different states supported by the central funding until 2011. Between 2000 and 2011, Rs 870 crore were released by the Centre towards the scheme. Post 2011, a lot of states abolished FTCs and as of March 2019, there were only 581 FTCs functioning in the country.\n",
      "A baseline survey conducted by a research centre at the National Law University, Delhi revealed that FTCs are facing several issues, ranging from poor infrastructure to lack of proper manpower. Even under the current plan for FTSCs, it is clear that the scheme will be in operation only for a temporary period of time. Judges are required to specifically target the 1,66,882 pending cases of rape and Pocso Act. The remaining cases are expected to be dealt either by FTCs that would be established under the 15th Finance Commission from 2020-25 or any other FTCs that the states/UTs establish.\n",
      "Government and judiciary need to adopt not a short-term plan but a long-term framework such as permanently establishing FTCs and ensuring that cases of heinous nature are expedited all the way through different levels of the judiciary. The three key players, that is the state government, central government and judiciary need to come together to bring concrete changes to the system. These reforms should be formulated with the objective of addressing systemic and deep-entrenched issues, and leave a long-lasting impact on the system.\n",

Sarwan Singh has been charged with the assault on the teenager on a Trent Barton Harlequin bus on February 22, 2018. Derby Crown Court heard he was arrested on December 23 when he arrived back in the UK on a flight from India.

The pensioner is yet to enter a plea and his case was adjourned until February 7 so reports can be obtained about his fitness to plead to the charge. Judge Jonathan Bennett handed him bail on the condition that he surrender his passport. Another condition ordered him to reside at a family member’s home until his next court appearance.More OnFamily\n",

      " The Delhi Traffic Police has issued an advisory for motorists expecting foggy days ahead and asked them to take precautions for safe commute in low visibility. The list of Do’s advised motorists to check weather forecasts, drive slow, use low-beam lights, remain patient and use pavement markings. “Use your low-beam headlights. High beams reflect off the moisture droplets in the fog, making it difficult to see,” said the advisory issued by Joint Commissioner (Traffic) of Police N S Bundela. The advisory suggests motorists to pull completely off the road in safe parking area if the fog is too dense. Motorists should avoid stopping on the travelled portion of the road as they could become the first link in a chain-reaction collision of vehicles. The advisory also advised drivers to refrain from sudden acceleration and passing other slow moving vehicles in a high speed.\n",

Ms Kaur isn't a government employee at all. She and the other women who work in the passport office are abandoned wives, volunteering their hours at the office to help women like them.Sibash Kabiraj, regional passport chief in Chandigarh, says it all began when the wives started coming to him and pleading for help.A lifelong bureaucrat with a taste for the fine print, Mr Kabiraj realised the law would allow him to suspend - and even cancel - the passports of overseas Indian men who had misled their wives.The Passport Authority requires approval from the central government to take away a passport but can do so if the holder lies or withholds information, or if there is a warrant or court summons, among other reasons.But there was a problem. \"One suspension of a passport, it requires a lot of paperwork,\" he says.Not one to be stopped, he explained passport law to the women, gave them a room with a computer, printer and fax machine, and told them if they would do the paperwork, he would sign it.It's the women's best way of seeking justice from their far-away husbands, he says.In the past year and a half, the women have managed to suspend more than 400 passports and revoke 67 others, Mr Kabiraj says. In all, more than 5,000 women have filed abandonment complaints with the Ministry of External Affairs.In all, more than 5,000 women have filed abandonment complaints with the Ministry of External Affairs.Indians living abroad aren't an easy group to take issue with. They sent $79 billion in remittances to India in 2018, the most of any country in the world, according to World Bank data. They're expected to send $82.2 billion in 2019.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called non-resident Indians, or NRIs, the \"brand ambassadors of India\". But the government's policy think tank NITI Aayog nicknamed them \"non-reliable Indian grooms\".The wives say many of the men demand - and often get - tens of thousands of dollars in dowry, despite the practice being illegal. The husbands can use that money to establish themselves overseas and obtain permanent residency or a new passport, leaving their wives and children behind - and in limbo.An abandoned woman has no status, says Shiwali Suman, who organises abandoned wives in New Delhi. \"Are we divorced, single, widowed?\" she asks. \"What are we actually? We are not able to be categorized.\"The men deny they have done anything wrong, saying they did their best but were taken advantage of by their wives. One says his life is \"hell\" now and he no longer trusts women.The wives left behind don't see it that way. In recent months, city and rural women alike have begun staging protests. One woman at a recent protest in Jalandhar in Punjab said time was up for the runaway men: \"There's a fire erupting in all of us.\"Reena Mehla was 24 when she got married. Five years later, she says, her husband told her he was going to work extra police duty shifts elsewhere in India, and instead hired smugglers to take him to the United States.Rahul Kumar now lives in the Bronx. Ms Mehla wrote to the Ministry of External Affairs, the US Embassy, US Citizenship and Immigration Services and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, searched Facebook, and eventually found him.She scrolls through dozens of emails she sent to foreign officials and the letter showing his passport was revoked; according to the US Justice Department immigration court hotline, his status in that country is pending. Then she pulls up one of their wedding pictures and kisses it.When asked if she still loves him, Ms Mehla stretches her arms and grins. \"Too much!\"She had the inner strength to leave her rural home and move on her own to Chandigarh to volunteer in the passport office. \"Even our soul is not allowed because a husband is everything. A husband is like God,\" she says.She shares her flat with several women, including Amritpal Kaur. Because most of the women in this story go by the name Kaur, Reuters is using their first names on second reference to ease confusion.When Amritpal talks about her marriage, she keeps coming back to the money she spent on it: She says she forked over $28,000 on the dowry and wedding; three days after they were married, she says, her husband told her to get $14,000 more from her father. Her husband, Kulpreet Singh, said all the money she had earned working for two years in England also needed to come to him, she says.Two weeks after the wedding, he left for Australia. For months afterward, he told her he had a surprise. She was so excited she ordered a $3,500 diamond ring for him.His surprise, she says, was divorce papers. Rahul and Kulpreet did not respond to requests for comment.Amritpal now shares a rented flat in Chandigarh with Reena and several other women. As a reminder of their mission, they've named the computer folder that holds their files \"Mission Shakti\".\"Shakti is women's spiritual power to fight against this,\" Amritpal says. \"We don't want any other girls to be victims like us.\"Every day, women with husband problems pile into Satwinder Kaur's family courtyard in a village surrounded by mustard fields that blaze like the sun. Only a few thousand people live in Toosa, but her relationships span the globe. She's helping nearly 400 women who've been abandoned by their men, she says, getting several of their runaway husbands deported from their adopted countries and jailed. Every few minutes her phone rings.Satwinder's own husband left her in 2015. He now lives in Poland. In Toosa, women don't venture out at night and are rarely left home alone, even in walled family compounds. Satwinder is slowly breaking through this - and in the process has become a symbol of a newfound willingness to fight back against a patriarchal system. She runs a WhatsApp group and Facebook page, and tells rural women what paperwork they need to cancel their husbands' passports. She also organizes protests.Satwinder Kaur's has filed 11 court cases against her NRI husband who abandoned her. \"It's hard to be a middle-aged, childless woman whose husband has left her,\" she said.She holds up photographs of fantastically lavish weddings produced from plastic bags or passed around on mobile phones and shared on WhatsApp. From Facebook, there are other pictures: of the husbands' foreign girlfriends and children and anniversary cakes.Even for Satwinder, who has filed 11 court cases against her husband, it's hard to be a middle-aged, childless woman whose husband has left her. Her ferocity is in constant battle with her fear.She sends her husband WhatsApp messages every day. She can tell he's read every one of them because of the little blue check marks, but he hasn't replied since January.Neighbours and even relatives call her banj, or \"rotten womb\", she says. \"In my own house, I was called that.\"A lecturer and electrical engineer, her husband, Arvinder Pal Singh, sees it differently. He says he moved to Europe because of pressure to earn more. He says he tried and failed to bring Satwinder to Europe on a student visa and says he was blindsided by problems between his wife and his mother when he returned home for a visit.He lost his job and moved twice. He told Satwinder he would send money again when he had it. Two months later she filed a case with the police and his father was arrested, he says. He later got a call from the Indian Embassy saying his passport had been cancelled. He stopped sending money and filed for divorce, which didn't go through.Arvinder says he no longer trusts women and calls himself a refugee. \"I don't have family. At least she is with family. She is in her home country. I don't have a country. I don't have a place to stay, and where I'm standing it's already raining outside,\" he says. \"This is hell.\"He says he would be arrested if he returned to India and doesn't believe he would get a fair hearing in court. Now undocumented, he uses smugglers to move.Baljit Kaur lives two lives. In the first, she's a policewoman, composed and authoritative in a pressed uniform and red lipstick. In the second, she's an aging bride, abandoned by her husband and sleeping under sheets printed with red hearts.\"I never imagined a woman of my age would end up like this,\" she says. \"I thought my life would be different.\"Baljit, 42, was one of four siblings born to an army officer and his wife in Punjab. She waited for her siblings to settle, so, at age 39, was late to marry. When pushed, she paid a large dowry, even though as a cop, she knew such payments were illegal.Before the wedding, Baljit says, her fiance, Harmandeep Singh Sekhon, would call to ask how much cash she would give his family. After the wedding, she says, her in-laws complained she hadn't brought as much as her sister-in-law.Soon Baljit understood why she'd been chosen: \"I understood he didn't want me, he only wanted money.\"Baljit Kaur who's policewoman and an aging bride says, \"I thought my life would be different.\" One month and two days after they married, her husband returned to the United States. He'd lived there before, and they'd talked about moving there together. A week after he arrived, she says, he called saying he had no job and needed her to send money. She refused.She last spoke to her husband on October 6, 2014. They have been locked in a legal battle ever since. She has been granted ownership of their house and has won maintenance costs, but those have yet to be paid, she says. She has spent more than $4,000 on lawyers' fees.\"I have a job, I can manage. But what about the girls who can't?\" she says.Harmandeep did not respond to requests for comment.Baljit became a cop in 1995. She worked her way up through training courses and exams and is an assistant sub-inspector at Fatehgarh Sahib District headquarters in Punjab. She has a sunny government flat with a plant-filled terrace and drives both a scooter and a car.Her hard-won career makes it even more humiliating that she was abandoned so publicly - and yet so intimately. As a police officer, shouldn't she have seen it coming?\"Sometimes she was brave,\" said Harpreet Kaur, a fellow officer who would pace the police station corridors with Baljit as she confided her troubles.\"Sometimes she would say...that people would laugh at her because she was a police officer and this thing happened.\"Baljit is spare with the details but admits she contemplated suicide: once before marriage when her husband was demanding money, other times after he left her.Baljit still says she doesn't feel like living. Her mother, whose imagined grief stopped her from committing suicide before, died in May. \"What else remains?\" she asks. \"I am alone.\"Of abandoned brides like herself, Baljit says: \"We are like dead bodies walking. We have no place in society. We can't live and we can't even die.\"Baljit's fellow officers have rallied around her. At lunchtime, half a dozen officers lay out newspapers on a desk and unpack their tiffins for a shared meal. \"We are her family,\" Inspector Kuldeepak Sharma says. \"She is not alone here.\"Sarbjeet Kaur's husband stopped sending money for his daughter's school fees in 2016, with three months left in the term. Sarbjeet sold her sofa and two cupboards so she could finish.Last year, she sold the gold earrings her parents had given to her daughter - again, for school fees, this time at her new, cheaper school.\"I'm living a double life,\" Sarbjeet says, crying as she explains that she couldn't tell her parents she had sold the earrings, so she said she had lost them.Sarbjeet married Daler Singh in 2008. It wasn't until she was pregnant that he talked of going abroad, she says. Her brother had gone to Italy, and it was eight years before he came back for a visit. She said no.He told her: \"'There is nothing here. There are no jobs, no money. Whatever job you do, you don't make money.'\" She eventually agreed. When her family got angry, she replied that Singh would never lie to her or leave her.Singh went to South America first, then Mexico, Sarbjeet says. She sold her jewellery for almost $5,000 to help him cross into the United States in late 2010, she says, and borrowed $3,600 from her parents to help him enter Canada four years later. She wanted her daughter, Ekampreet, to study in Canada, so she pawned her cousins', aunts' and friends' jewellery for $700, too.He did send money back, but only for his family, she says. \"'Don't worry,' she says he told her, 'my one-month salary will buy your jewellery back and I'll pay back your parents, too.'\"She shows pictures of him posing beside fancy cars on Facebook; she knows he was actually working as a gas station attendant.In 2015, he asked for a divorce, saying he needed a paper marriage to a Canadian woman so he could stay while the government processed his refugee application.When Sarbjeet confronted the new woman in a series of audio messages on Facebook Messenger, the other woman said she would also fight. \"'You have a daughter,' she said. 'I have a son.'\"Sarbjeet's husband, Daler Singh, called her description of events \"fake\". He says he was 17 - a minor - when he married her, and that they have now been separated for a decade. He says he has given her money and property but didn't give any further details or respond to specific questions.Sarbjeet lives in sugar cane country where the chimneys of brick factories occasionally pierce the fields to puff gray smoke. Her parents keep cows. She wants better for her daughter, so offered the new woman a compromise: If Singh would call his daughter regularly and send $142 a month for her expenses, she would drop her case and stop trying to cancel his passport.He did for a while, then he stopped, she says. Now Sarbjeet worries constantly about money.Sarbjeet was a beautician before she got married. These days she stitches salwar kameez and simple dresses on a pedal-operated machine beside her bed to earn money.She charges $2 for a dress, which takes her two days to finish. If there's a rush, she can do it overnight. The stress has sometimes overwhelmed Sarbjeet.When Ekampreet was 3, Sarbjeet tried to commit suicide by drinking rat poison. Five years later, she tried again by slitting her wrists. She went twice to a hospital in Amritsar for depression.Now, she says, she is stronger. In March, Sarbjeet applied to have Singh's passport impounded. Satwinder, whom she met late last year, helped. Eventually, the passport office called to say it was done.When asked about her father, Ekampreet says only that she wants to ask him what she did wrong and why he left her. Shuffling through a stack of pictures, she comes across a wedding photo of her parents, her mother in a bright red and gold sari. She quickly buries it in the looked-at pile.

      "Mumbai: A hearing and speech impaired man was acquitted of abducting and sexually assaulting a girl, around four years after he was arrested. The man was acquitted of all charges by a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act court in Mumbai. \n",
      "The man and the victim studied in the same school and had eloped in October 2014 to Tirupati. The girl's mother approached the police and lodged a missing complaint about her daughter. The police located the girl and the couple was brought back to Mumbai in January 2015. \n",
      "An investigation revealed that the man had been working at a restaurant in Tirupati for Rs 120. During the trial of the case, the man said (in sign language) that he should not be subjected to punishment for being 'in love'. He also told the court that he got married to the girl. \n",
      "According to the Times of India's report, the court observed that the man wanted to start a family with the girl. The court also said that the girl agreed to elope with the man and she understood the depth of a relationship. The court further observed, \"She had willingly travelled with him in public transport. She never objected when he introduced her as his wife for procuring residence. \"\n",

      "During the trial, the court also stated that the documents presented on behalf of the girl were not ample proof of that fact that she was a minor at the time of the incident. The girl told the court that the deaf and mute man had forced her to establish physical relations with him. However, in her statement to the magistrate in 2015, the girl had accepted that her relationship was based on consent. \n",
      "In Tirupati, the couple lived in a crowded area. The court stated that the girl did not make a single attempt to get help, run away or escape from the house in Tirupati. The court said that the girl did not even make an attempt to flee from the area even when she used to go to the washroom alone. The court pointed out that the fact that the girl did not try to run away from Tirupati is evidence of the fact that the relationship was consensual. The court said that this a case where a \"differently-abled boy and girl who were in love chose to live together without parents' consent. \"\n",

      " A day after Chennai Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan said that the police would probe the Pakistani links of advocate Gayatri Khandhadai, who participated in the anti-CAA kolam protest, she explained that in 2016 she had only filed a report for ‘Bytes for All’ [a Pakistan based advocacy group] highlighting the discrimination faced by religious minorities in nine Asian countries. “In this report, I have also written about the discrimination faced by Hindus in Pakistan and Bangladesh. It would have been nice if the police had read the report completely and then addressed the press conference,” she told journalists in Madurai on Thursday. “By revealing my Facebook profile during the press conference, Chennai City Police have compromised my privacy and security. Chennai City Police Commissioner is responsible for my safety and security,” she said. Ms. Khandhadai denied that she had deleted any content from her Facebook account.The Commissioner had also said that the police detained anti-CAA protesters only after an elderly person opposed the protesters from drawing kolams in front of his house. However, Ms. Gayathri contended, “We did not go to that house or meet that person. We did not draw kolams in front of houses that opposed us.”Henri Tiphagne, founder and executive director of People’s Watch, charged that the police are targeting human rights defenders including Ms. Khandhadai and Arappor Iyakkam and condemned it. “A complaint regarding this has been submitted to the National Human Rights Commission and we will take steps to ensure that the issue was taken by the Bar Council of India,” he said.Senior advocates T. Lajapathi Roy and M. Ajmal Khan also condemned the police for detaining advocates who went to provide legal aid to the protesters. They stressed that the Bar Council of India must consider the incident suo motu and take necessary action.Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri demanded that the police investigation against Ms. Khandhadai’s alleged Pakistan connection be dropped immediately. Mr. Alagiri said she was not associated with any organisation in Pakistan but had only undertaken research for a Pakistan based research organisation. “In the 80-page report filed by her about minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives and Indonesia, there is nothing that is supporting Pakistan. If he finds such a thing in the report, the Police Commissioner must furnish proof,” Mr. Alagiri said.Mr. Alagiri said the action against Ms. Khandhadai was vindictive on the part of the government and requested the Commissioner to not toe such a line of the rulers.\n",

      "BHOPAL: Accusing the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh of patronizing violent protests against the Sikh community in villages of Sheopur district, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa has sought immediate intervention from Union Home Minister Amit Shah in the issue.\n",
      "Sirsa, who is also an MLA of Shiromani Akali Dal (ruling NDA’s key constituent) in Delhi has sought immediate intervention from Home Minister Amit Shah in the issue of forcefully expulsion of Sikhs from Madhya Pradesh villages. He also demanded strong action against Chief Minister Kamal Nath and his government for patronizing such violent actions against Sikhs in the state.\n",
      "In a statement released on Monday, Sirsa (who is also national spokesperson of Shiromani Akali Dal) alleged that the Kamal Nath government is patronizing violent protests against the Sikhs in some villages falling in Karhal Tehsil of Sheopur district. He said that these people have been given police protection and they are openly raising slogans to expel the Sikhs from these villages and usurp their properties.\n",
      "The SAD leader further said that not only this but these people are also raising slogans that \"whosoever will support Sikhs will be given beating with shoes and throw out Sikhs from Karhal\". They were also threatened to meet the same fate of 1984 genocide and those people repeatedly announced this from their gathering.\n",
      "He added that on one hand, the country has passed Citizenship Amendment Act and is inviting Sikhs from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan to come to India where they will get protection against all the abuses. But on the other hand, the occurrence of incidents like those in Madhya Pradesh has raised concern in the Sikh community.\n",
      "He also announced that a delegation from the DSGMC will visit the affected families soon and it will provide every help and support to these Sikh families. Meanwhile, acting in the matter, the chief minsiterordered a detailed probe into entire matter on Thursday including the administrative action having been taken to remove encroachment from public and private lands in villages under Karhal tehshil of Sheopur district.\n",
      "He has said that some people from Sikh community have alleged discriminatory action by the local administration, after which the authorities have been asked to ensure that injustice isn’t meted out to anyone.\n",
      "Also, a Committee comprising Sikh community members has been constituted under convenership of Congress leader Narendra Saluja. The Committee members will tour the concerned villages and meet the affected villagers before submitting report in the matter to the CM.\n",

      "©   Global Look Press / Hindustan TimesIndian commuters use high-speed Wi-Fi in Delhi Metro train for the first time on January 2, 2020.  Free high-speed Wi-Fi has been launched on the underground metro system in India's capital, Delhi, with key technology for the project provided by the Russian company that developed Wi-Fi for Moscow's subway.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Delhi Metro is a massive urban transport system spanning 325 kilometers, and linking the Indian capital to its satellite towns. The sheer size of the transport network, used by almost three million commuters every day, sets it firmly among the largest metro systems in the world, including those in London, Shanghai, Beijing, and New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, with the help of Russian telecoms expertise, the city's underground network has also joined the ranks of metro systems offering free Wi-Fi to its passengers. It's on just one line so far, the link from the city's commercial district to Indira Gandhi International Airport.\n",
      "      \n",
      "\n",
      "The Wi-Fi service, the first of its kind in south Asia, was launched on Thursday by Delhi Metro Managing Director Mangu Singh. Russian firm MaximaTelecom was the project's primary contractor and technology provider, although the internet facilities themselves were built by a number of Indian companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "MaximaTelecom has notable experience in developing such networks, having already built similar Wi-Fi systems for both the Moscow and St Petersburg metros. It also launched free Wi-Fi at almost 60 metro stations in Delhi in late 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "Launching free Wi-Fi on one line of the New Delhi subway seems an ideal first step in the telecom company's ambitious plans in India. The company has already announced its aim to expand the project to two more lines in the near future, providing half of all commuters using the city's metro with high-speed Wi-Fi.\n",

      "  Nolan Pinto    BengaluruJanuary 3, 2020UPDATED: January 3, 2020 03:12 IST  A day before the violence, the local police invoked Section 144. (Photo: PTI)After the violent protests that shook Mangaluru, the cyber wing of the Mangaluru police have been cracking down on those trying to incite violence.With many fingers pointing to the role of the SDPI and PFI in the anti-CAA protests, India Today TV accessed a WhatsApp message circulated that was meant to disobey the orders of the police as well as create trouble.A day before the violence, the local police invoked Section 144. In spite of this rule and meetings held by Mangaluru Police Commissioner with members of the minority community, the message was sent to bring people out on the streets on December 19.The message sent by SDPI's Riyaz Faringepete in Kannada translates thus: \"In the Anti-CAA protests that are going to take place, we Muslims must stand together as firmly as bricks laced with lead. If we are united, the Mangaluru police or even the Indian Army soldier cannot stop us. We must stand with pride like a human shield against the guns and lathis.

      " At the de-induction ceremony in Jodhpur on December 27. PTI\n",
      "On December 27, the Indian Air Force retired its fleet of MiG-27s. The 29 Squadron, known as the Scorpios, flew the aircraft into the sunset at the IAF’s Jodhpur base.\n",
      "The service life of the ‘swing wing’-type aircraft marked an important era for the IAF as various efforts were made to strengthen the nation’s air defences. The Russian-origin MiG-27s were inducted in 1984-85, and underwent a midlife upgrade around 2006.\n",
      "Ground attack aircraft \n",
      "The MiG-27 is primarily a ‘ground attack’ aircraft, whose main role is to conduct precision air strikes in battle while tackling the adversary’s air defences. The jets have proved to be extremely effective in both Battle Air Strikes — air attacks in a war situation to support ground forces — and in Battle Air Interdiction, which are preventive operations that are sometimes carried out deep inside enemy territory, to target enemy installations, supplies, and forces, and hamper its future actions.\n",
      "OPINION | Up and away\n",
      "In the 1980s, the IAF had the MiG-21, but was in need of effective modern aircraft that could perform Battle Air Strikes and Battle Air Interdiction roles. The MiG-21, which was at the time used in ground attack roles, was primarily an ‘Interceptor’ aircraft. The induction of the swing wing MiG-23BN, in a way a predecessor of the MiG-27, was an important addition to the IAF’s capabilities.\n",
      "Swing wing aircraft \n",
      "Swing wing (or variable geometry) technology allowed the aircraft to change the sweep of their wings — thus changing the geometry of the plane as per operational requirements. This provided flexibility and an ability to stay stable at low altitudes; however, the additional hardware mechanism added to the aircraft’s weight, and increased the possibility of failure.\n",
      "Advances in aerodynamics ensured that variable geometry aircraft were no longer needed. The 29 squadron that operated the upgraded MiG-27 was the IAF’s last swing wing squadron.\n",
      "Swing wing was not the only distinguishing feature of the MiG-27. Said Angad Singh, air power analyst at Observer Research Foundation: “The navigation and attack systems of the MiG-27 were second to none when it was inducted. It was a very effective strike aircraft when operating as designed at high speeds and low altitudes. The indigenous upgrade made it even more potent, and it was widely regarded as the most accurate weapons delivery platform of the IAF.”\n",
      "Record of performance \n",
      "At the time the MiG-27s were inducted, India’s air defence was focussed primarily on Pakistan. The jet showed its efficacy over Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Punjab, and also proved to be extremely effective in the high altitude conflict in Kargil in 1999. In Kargil, the MiG-27 took part in the IAF operation codenamed Safed Sagar, in which Air Force assets operated jointly with ground forces.\n",
      "The Kargil war saw the most extensive role for the IAF since the 1971 war. MiG-21s, MiG-23s, and MiG-27s were used, along with Jaguar and Mirage jets. Then Flight Lieutenant K Nachiketa’s MiG-27 was hit by the Pakistanis, after which he ejected and was held prisoner for more than a week.\n",
      "Concerns over safety \n",
      "The MiG-27 suffered its share of accidents, including a couple of crashes in 2019 as well. Some of the officers who flew the aircraft believe that having one of the most powerful engines in the single-engine category may have made the MiG-27 more prone to engine malfunctions. “The engine was the principal safety issue with the jet. Engine fires and other failures relating to the powerplant were common,” Angad Singh said.\n",
      "The jet also saw groundings like the one in February 2010, after an accident in Siliguri. Air Chief Marshal P V Naik (retd), who was Chief of the Air Staff at the time, said, “Whenever an accident takes place, a Court of Inquiry is set up to investigate the causes. If there are reasons of the concern, the fleet is grounded. There is nothing unusual in that. All the aircraft are then checked before being cleared for flying.”\n",
      "Retirements, replacements \n",
      "As the ‘Bahadur’ aircraft — a name the MiG-27 acquired during the Kargil War — was decommissioned, there was concern over the Air Force’s depleting strength. The IAF is still operating four squadrons of the upgraded MiG-21s, which entered service before the MiG-27s, but will phase out its entire MiG fleet by 2024. The MiG-21s will be the last one to go.\n",
      "Angad Singh explained: “Aircraft retirement has little to do with induction date. The life of an aircraft is described in flying hours or years of service. Typically after an upgrade, the aircraft life is extended by a certain amount. In the case of the MiG-27, this was around 10 years, whereas for the MiG-21 Bison, the figure was 15 years. Considering both aircraft were upgraded around the same time in the mid-2000s, the MiG-27 would logically be retired earlier.”\n",
      "The Air Force is now operating with 28 fighter squadrons against its sanctioned strength of 42. The proposed addition of two more Sukhoi squadrons, two Rafale squadrons, and various versions of the indigenous Light Combat Aircraft Tejas, will fill in for the retiring MiGs and legacy aircraft like the Jaguar.\n",

There is a risk to US civil aviation operating in the territory and airspace of Pakistan due to extremist/militant activity,\" said the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in a notice to airmen (NOTAM) dated December 30, 2019.  The NOTAM is applicable to all US-based airlines and US-based pilots. The US regulator said in its NOTAM that there continues to be a risk to US civil aviation sector from attacks against airports and aircraft in Pakistan, particularly for aircraft on the ground and aircraft operating at low altitudes, including during the arrival and departure phases of flights. \"The ongoing presence of extremist/militant elements operating in Pakistan poses a continued risk to US civil aviation from small-arms fire, complex attacks against airports, indirect weapons fire, and anti-aircraft fire, any of which could occur with little or no warning,\" it said. The FAA said that while, to date, there have been no reports of man-portable air defense systems or Manpads being used against the civil aviation sector in Pakistan, some extremist or militant groups operating there are suspected of having access to these Manpads. \"As a result, there is a potential risk for extremists/militants to target civil aviation in Pakistan with Manpads,\" it said.     The regulator added that pilots or airlines must report safety or security incidents - which may happen in Pakistan - to the FAA. Pakistan on July 16 last year opened its airspace for India after about five months of restrictions imposed in the wake of a standoff with New Delhi. Following the Balakot airstrikes by the Indian Air Force, Pakistan had closed its airspace on February 26 last year. Pakistan in October last year had denied India's request to allow Prime Minister Narendra Modi's VVIP flight to use its airspace for his visit to Saudi Arabia over the Kashmir issue.  Also Read | ICAO acknowledges India's concerns about Pak's denial of airspace Also Read | Pakistan denies airspace for PM Modi flight; India lodges complaint​ Latest World NewsFight against Coronavirus: Full coverage   pakistan air spaceus airlines                 Write a comment                Fight Against Coronavirus  Have Covid-19 symptoms? 10 points to know Coronavirus state wise cases in India Coronavirus: Busting myths and fake news with experts Coronavirus or flu: Tips to identify    Top News    Gujarat BJP MLA tests COVID-19 positive, takes count to 3    Wajid Khan passes away: Salman Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, Priyanka Chopra among others pay tribute     'Inspiring' to see the way Virat Kohli approaches every format: Robin Uthappa    Barber shops, salons to open in Delhi: Precautions you should take while visiting one    Something good in 2020: Twitterati excited after launch of Crew Dragon by Elon Musk's SpaceX, NASA    Liquor shops in Delhi can now open daily, no odd-even rule    Xiaomi Mi Notebook arriving in India on June 11: All you need to know                Latest News    'Racism is in cricket too': Chris Gayle sends out strong message following George Floyd's death    'Inspiring' to see the way Virat Kohli approaches every format: Robin Uthappa    Salman Khan mourns Wajid Khan's death: Will always love, respect, remember and miss you    Sachin Tendulkar shares heartwarming message on Global Day of Parents                    India TV :  Contact Us About Us Careers Advertise Complaint Redressal In the Press Salaam India Awards Investors Column 21 Years Aap ki Adalat Hindi News Live TV    Be connected :  Mobile Zone Mail Alerts Facebook Twitter Fan Blogs on Wordpress Fan Blogs on Blogspot India Tv Contest Hints    Other Services :  Live TV Trending Photos Videos Hindi Samachar Latest News in Hindi News India Sports News Business News India Business News Stock Market Live Gold Price                 © 2009-2020 Independent News Service.

      " According to a Supreme Court judgment, a child is allowed to stay with his or her mother in prison till the age of six. (Representational Image)\n",
      "The Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has written to the Director General of Police, stating that notices should be issued to all police stations across the state asking them to produce children in the age group of 6-18 years before the Child Welfare Committee if their parents face arrest.\n",
      "According to a Supreme Court judgment, a child is allowed to stay with his or her mother in prison till the age of six. Others between the age of six and 18, can stay with their father, other relatives or in protective custody at a children’s home.\n",
      "Members of the commission, while visiting prisons in the state, were approached by a few women undertrials, who informed them that they were not aware where their children were after their arrest. Social workers, working in prisons, also informed commission members that while making arrests, the police do not necessarily ask the accused if there have minor children.\n",
      "“The letter to the DGP was as per the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act and other Acts pertaining to children. The request is to produce minors of accused persons to be produced before the district Child Welfare Committee by the police after the arrest of a parent so that they are not left outside and put in some dangerous situation,” said Santosh Shinde, member of the commission. He said, as per provisions of the JJ Act, the CWC can hand over the custody of a child to a parent, or guardian or take the child into protective custody. The parents should also be in the know of the well-being of the child.\n",
      "The letter also states that the parents should, from time-to-time, be informed about the child. It also states that regular reports should be sent to the commission regarding the compliance of this.\n",
      "According to Prison Statistics of India, 2018, the total number of women inmates with children is 1,732 with 1,999 children. In Maharashtra, there are 97 women inmates in the state’s prisons with 117 children.\n",

      "  Technology NewsNews-AnalysisOyo Rooms accused of questionable practices, toxic culture and fraud by former employees, hotel partnersOyo has also imposed extra fees on hotels and declined to pay the hotels the full amounts they claimed they were owed, according to interviewsThe New York TimesJan 08, 2020 11:55:25 ISTOyo, a startup that offers budget hotel rooms, has grown into one of India’s most valuable private companies and aims to be the world’s largest hotel chain by 2023.\n",
      "But at least part of Oyo’s rise in India was built on practices that raise questions about the health of its business, according to financial filings, court documents and interviews with 20 current and former employees, as well as others familiar with the startup’s operations. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from the company.\n",
      "Oyo offers rooms from unavailable hotels, such as those that have left its service, according to the company’s chief executive and nine of the current and former employees. That has the effect of inflating the number of rooms listed on Oyo’s site.\n",
      "Thousands of the rooms are from unlicensed hotels and guesthouses, its executives have acknowledged. To deter trouble from authorities over the illegal rooms, Oyo sometimes gives free lodging to police and other officials, according to nine of the current and former employees and internal WhatsApp messages viewed by The New York Times.\n",
      "Oyo has also imposed extra fees on hotels and declined to pay the hotels the full amounts they claimed they were owed, according to interviews with hotel owners and employees, emails, legal complaints and other documents viewed by The Times. Some hotel operators have sought to file criminal complaints against Oyo, which said it withheld payments primarily over the hotels’ customer service issues.\n",
      "“It’s a bubble that will burst,” said Saurabh Mukhopadhyay, a former Oyo operations manager in northern India who left the company in September.\n",
      "Oyo is part of a group of prominent startups that have sprinted to get as big as possible, fed by money from large investors such as Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. Now some of those young companies — from office rental company WeWork in New York to delivery service Instacart in San Francisco — have started showing cracks in their businesses.\n",
      "Oyo rooms. Image: Facebook\n",
      "Any fall by Oyo could blight India’s startup landscape, which has received billions in foreign capital in recent years, spawning other multibillion-dollar companies such as ride-hailing firm Ola and digital payments provider Paytm.\n",
      "It would also be another black eye for SoftBank, which is Oyo’s biggest investor and owns half the startup’s stock. Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s chief executive, has hailed Oyo as a jewel of his company’s $100 billion Vision Fund, even as he recently wrote off billions of dollars on other investments like WeWork.\n",
      "“This is the only company which went global at this scale from India,” Satish Meena, a senior forecaster for research firm Forrester in New Delhi, said of Oyo. “But as of now, there are serious doubts about the business model.”\n",
      "SoftBank declined to comment.\n",
      "Ritesh Agarwal, Oyo’s chief executive, acknowledged in a recent interview that some of his company’s room listings included hotels that it no longer worked with. He said Oyo left those listings up and marked them as “sold out” as it tried to woo the hotels back.\n",
      "Aditya Ghosh, Oyo’s head of India operations, also said in an interview that many hotels lacked required licenses, leaving them vulnerable to the occasional government raid. He denied that Oyo gave free rooms to officials.\n",
      "Ghosh dismissed what he called “noise” from hotels about extra fees and nonpayment of bills. “The disagreement is about the penalties we charge on customer service failure,” he said.\n",
      "He added that nearly 80 percent of Oyo’s employees had been at the company for less than a year, so training has been a challenge. “We have just grown very, very fast,” he said.\n",
      "Founded in 2013 by Agarwal, then a 19-year-old student, Oyo set out to organise India’s budget hotels, which have traditionally been small, family-run enterprises. The company coaxes the hotels to become Oyo-branded destinations that list exclusively through its website; it then markets those rooms online to travellers and takes a cut of each stay. The startup also runs some hotels itself.\n",
      "Oyo is trying to expand globally and now offers more than 1.2 million rooms in 80 countries, including the United States. It employs more than 20,000 people and has raised more than $2.5 billion in funding. Agarwal has become a business star, hobnobbing with India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi.\n",
      "But as Oyo has grown, its losses have mushroomed. The company expects to lose money through at least 2021, according to recent government filings. Some efforts to expand in countries like Japan have flopped.\n",
      "In December, SoftBank and Agarwal put another $1.5 billion into Oyo to accelerate its expansion. The funding, negotiated over the summer, valued the company at $8 billion.\n",
      "At the same time, two other big investors, Sequoia Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners, reduced their holdings. The venture capital firms, which both hold board seats at Oyo, sold $1.5 billion of their stock — about half their stakes — to Agarwal. He borrowed money to buy the shares and paid the venture firms a price that valued Oyo at $10 billion.\n",
      "Lightspeed and Sequoia declined to comment.\n",
      "The current and former workers said that Oyo was never an easy place to work but that pressure increased over the last year.\n",
      "Mohammad Jahanzeb Gul, who joined the startup in January 2019 and supervised 23 Oyo properties, said that during the nine months he was there, he sometimes spent all day and night in front of a computer to meet deadlines.\n",
      "“The culture is really very toxic,” he said.\n",
      "Mukhopadhyay, who began working at Oyo in August 2018, said employees were under so much pressure to add new rooms that they brought hotels online that lacked air conditioning, water heaters or electricity. He and eight others said their managers had asked them to engage in a monthly shell game of briefly inserting these unavailable properties into Oyo’s listings — complete with fake photographs — to help impress investors.\n",
      "Ghosh, who left the India job this week and joined Oyo’s board, said that some hotels open in stages and that “there is no padding.”\n",
      "Saurabh Sharma, who worked for Oyo from 2014 to 2018 as an operations manager, said the company sometimes deliberately withheld payments from hotel owners — a practice that half a dozen other current and former employees also described.\n",
      "In some cases, they said, the startup wanted to squeeze the hotel owners into renegotiating contracts that it deemed unprofitable. In others, Oyo wanted to save money and figured that most owners would not press for full payment.\n",
      "“If 1,000 people shout, we will pay 200,” Sharma said Oyo managers had told him.\n",
      "In a police complaint filed in November, Betz Fernandez, owner of the Roxel Inn in Bangalore, said Oyo owed him $49,000 and acted with “intention to cheat and cause wrongful loss” by charging him for nonexistent guests and refusing to pay the contracted minimum monthly payment. Oyo said the dispute was in arbitration.\n",
      "Oyo’s oversight of its workers was also sometimes so lax that employees brazenly stole from it, said four people who were involved in the startup’s fraud-fighting efforts.\n",
      "Because Oyo hotels are popular with unmarried couples looking for places for their trysts, one scheme involved workers at properties run directly by the startup colluding to keep the guests checked in after they left. The workers then cleaned and resold the rooms for cash to other guests and pocketed the money, the people said.\n",
      "Oyo has conducted surprise raids at some properties, seizing employee cellphones and checking rooms and records for evidence, they said.\n",
      "An Oyo spokeswoman said it investigates all fraud accusations and had in some instances fired employees.\n",
      "Executives have also asked employees to paper over troubling incidents, some workers said.\n",
      "Mukhopadhyay said that one night last June, a long-term guest at an Oyo-run property in Noida, near New Delhi, called him. She said three men had raped her in her room.\n",
      "The next morning, Mukhopadhyay and another Oyo employee were summoned to the police station, where they pleaded with the guest not to register a formal complaint. Oyo’s legal team also instructed them not to tell anyone about the incident because it could hurt the company’s image, he said. The guest withdrew the complaint and moved out.\n",
      "In a telephone interview, the guest confirmed Mukhopadhyay’s account. Oyo disputed some details and said any decision to file a complaint was up to the guest. Noida police said they had no record of a complaint.\n",
      "To placate authorities over unlicensed properties, Oyo managers also gave police and other government officials free rooms on request, current and former employees said. They said the details were recorded in dedicated WhatsApp groups, one of which The Times reviewed.\n",
      "Ghosh said, “We do not encourage or involve ourselves in any kind of bribery or graft.”\n",
      "Mukhopadhyay said Oyo’s growth practices contributed to his decision to leave.\n",
      "“There’s something called integrity,” he said. “I can’t compromise on that.”\n",

She won by a margin of 940 votes. The DMK worker contested in ward 2 of Karuveppampatty panchayat union. Thanking party president M K Stalin for choosing her to contest, she said: “His father Karunanidhi had recognised the transgender community. Following his footsteps, Stalin gave the seat to me,” she said. Riya bagged 2,701 votes and her opponent C Kandhammal secured 1,751 votes. After receiving the winning certificate, Riya told TOI that she will work for everyone in the ward. “I will not be partial to any group.” She said she will focus on the poor and the needy. Riya said the panchayat union needed basic amenities such as roads, drinking water and drainage. “But, I will focus on the drinking water issue as the residents are struggling for potable water,” she said, adding that she will continue to urge the district administration and the government to uplift her ward.

The film found a place in the list of feature films for the Academy Awards.\n",
      "The chef-turned-filmmaker took to Instagram and Twitter to share his excitement along with a few stills from the Neena Gupta-starrer.  Actor Neena Gupta who plays a central role in the film reacted to Khanna's tweet and said that she cannot believe that the film is in the Oscar race.\n",
      "'The Last Color' has not been released in Indian theatres yet but was premiered at the Mumbai film festival this year.Produced by Odisha based producer Jitendra Mishra and helmed by Vikas Khanna, the film revolves around the lives of windows residing in Indian religious sites of Vrindavan and Varanasi. \n",
      "Right after the news, excited Neena Gupta spoke to a publication and spilled the beans on her forthcoming projects that consist of some interesting films.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said, \"I'm getting a lot of different roles to play now. Some are of mothers but some are different but very challenging parts. I have finished seven projects, including web shows already. Panga releases this month. There is Shubh Mangal Zyaada Savdhaan that I just finished, then there's Nikkhil Advani's next (starring Arjun Kapoor and Rakul Preet Singh), that I was shooting for in Patiala. My role in that film is a secret but everyone will be surprised when they see me in it.\" And then she dropped a piece of news that no one saw coming. She confirmed that she has also shot for Ranveer Singh's Kapil Dev Biopic, titled '83'. She said, \"I have a small cameo in Kabir Khan's '83. I play Kapil Dev as in Ranveer Singh's mother in the film. I have just shot for it.\" Apart from being a versatile actor and proving her mettle as an actor over the years, Neena has also been vocal about issues that bother or concern her. She was the first one to point out how actors her age are not roped in for roles suited for them, instead, younger actors 'take' the challenge and try to pull them off by prosthetic and makeup.This snowballed into a huge controversy that involved Saand Ki Aankh actors Taapsee Pannu and Bhumi Pednekar. The  Conversation (0)Start a conversation, not a fire.

      "“Similarly, we have also heard that (Congress leader) Rahul Gandhi is homosexual,” said Swami Chakrapani while countering the below-the-belt allegations.\n",
      "The booklet, titled `Veer Savarkar Kitne Veer?', was distributed during the 10-day camp of Congress Seva Dal. It says, “Details of such physical relationship of Godse are found from the period before he took to brahmacharya. It was a gay relationship. His partner was his political guru Veer Savarkar.”\n",
      "\"Writer has written it on the basis of evidence. But that's not important for us whether he was gay or not. In our country today, everyone has a legal right to have their own preferences,\" Congress Seva Dal chief Lalji Desai told news agency ANI yesterday.\n",

They are doing character assassination of patriots. Congress leaders should stop defaming patriot like Savarkar. Congress never liked freedom fighters,\" he said.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Congress spokesperson Durgesh Sharma said, \"The literature distributed in the Congress Seva Dal is not new. What has been said about Savarkar is well known. It is well known that he apologised to the British.\"\n",
      "He added, \"Savarkar had supported Jinnah's idea of dividing the country. All this is literature and Congress had not written it; this was written by litterateurs. The country should know about all these things today because of the way some leaders are declaring Godse as a patriot. People should know who sacrificed for the country and who took the side of the British.\"\n",

      "The couple would quarrel frequently, as the husband would come home inebriated, the official said. The incident took place when the wife allegedly threatened to commit suicide and poured diesel on herself, following which Pawar allegedly threw a lit matchstick on the victim. The woman sustained 70 per cent burns and was rushed to the hospital by her husband, he added.\n",
      "A case has been registered against Pawar under section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code and the police are yet to make an arrest, the official said.\n",

      "Bengaluru: A 35-year-old woman gave away her 53-year-old infant through illegal adoption process and immediately approached the police out of guilt and pleaded them to reunite her with her child.  Following her request, the police traced the baby and to a Mysuru-based couple and handed over the boy to a Child Welfare Committee in Bengaluru, a Times of India report read.\n",
      "The police also booked the infant's biological parents and the man who lead them to the Mysuru couple.Identified as residents of Banashankari, the couple was blessed with a baby boy on October 23. Since there was no one to look after the child, they employed domestic help. But the workers kept quitting one after the other and the couple found it difficult to concentrate on their work, the report read.\n",
      "They then decided to give up their child for adoption and came across a man, who assured them that he would find a family that is educated with stable financial conditions.  On December 13, he told the couple that he had found a family that wanted to adopt the child and on December 16, he handed over the child to a man, his wife and another senior citizen at Janta Bazaar. The adoptive parents promised to take care of the child but asked the birth parents to not seek their whereabouts.\n",
      "After they gave the child away, the biological mother began to feel guilty and contacted the middleman to know where her child was, but he was unaware.  On Tuesday, the woman filed a complaint at CK Achukattu police station and confessed to her crime of illegally selling the baby.\n",
      "A police officer said that the two are professionals and could not devote enough time to the child. He said it appears that no money was involved. \"We have booked the couple and the middleman under sections 80, 81 and 87 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. We are probing all angles,\" the police officer added.\n",

File image of Mangaluru police firing at protesters news CAA Friday, January 03, 2020 - 13:28                  Prajwal Bhat  Follow @prajwalmanipal An interim fact-finding report on the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protest and subsequent police firing in Mangaluru on December 19 found that police action \"was excessive, biased and specifically targeted the Muslim community.\"The report was compiled by a group of human rights and civil liberty activists from Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and New Delhi belonging to the All India People's Forum (AIPF), People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) and National Confederation of Human Rights Organisations (NCHRO). In the report, the activists called for a judicial inquiry to be conducted into the police firing and the police action at Highland Hospital, where the victims of the firing were taken to. They also called for the suspension of Mangaluru Police Commissioner PS Harsha and urged the state government to provide compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the victims' families. The report recounted the sequence of events that led to the police opening fire on protesters in Mangaluru on December 19. An initial protest outside the Deputy Commissioner's office was quelled by tear gas and lathicharge by the police since protesters had defied prohibitory orders under section 144 of the CrPC. Read: Mangaluru police firing deaths: A timeline of what happened on December 19However, the fact-finding team alleged that the police infuriated the Muslim community by selectively targeting shops and mosques. \"At around 4 pm, a team of police attacked Ibrahim Khaleel mosque where about 80 persons were praying peacefully. The police apparently sought to chase certain youth into the said mosque and then initiated an indiscriminate attack upon the mosque. The police launched an attack of stones and teargas through and above the slats of the mosque gate, causing havoc and confusion,\" alleges the report. The Ibrahim Khaleel mosque is located on Nellikai Road, which is 450 metres away from the Mangaluru North (Bunder) police station where the police personnel opened fire on protesters. The report goes on to add that \"the police began indiscriminate firing of guns and teargas\" on Azizuddin Road outside the Mangaluru North (Bunder) Police Station at 4:30 pm. Two people were killed due to the police firing. Abdul Jaleel, 42 and Nausheen, 23, were shot in the eye and midriff respectively. The victims were daily-wage labourers working in Mangaluru. Their families were denied compensation of Rs 10 lakh which was initially announced by the state government. An FIR registered at the Mangaluru North (Bunder) police station accuses them of rioting. Read: Lack of tear gas led to police firing? Cops, witnesses divided on Mangaluru firing deathsThe fact-finding team also raised questions over the police action at Highland Hospital, where the victims of the police firing were taken to. \"After Jaleel and Nausheen were declared dead on arrival at Highland Hospital, the police was called so that the bodies could be handed over to them as these were Medico Legal Cases (MLC). The police upon arrival at the hospital were faced by an angry group of mourners, who pelted stones at the police outside the hospital. The police engaged in lathicharge outside the hospital,\" read the report. \"They did not stop there. The police then fired tear gas within the hospital compound and proceeded to storm the hospital. They tried to barge into patient rooms including the ICU. At least three patients who were admitted there prior to December 19th were adversely affected due to this. The health of two patients who were admitted with respiratory issues deteriorated and had to be shifted to the ICU and one of them was put on a ventilator,\" the report added. The team spoke to the families of the victims of police firing, shopkeepers near the State Bank of India and other areas in Bunder, officials at the Ibrahim Khaleel mosque, met the administration of Highland Hospital, District Medical Officer, of Wenlock Hospital Dr Rajeshwari Devi, Assistant Commissioner Madan Mohan, and Commissioner of Police PS Harsha.  Following the violent incidents, a curfew was imposed in Dakshina Kannada district for three days while mobile internet services were suspended in the district for two days. Police officials in Mangaluru attempted to justify their actions by posting videos of protesters pelting stones on December 19 in different parts of Mangaluru. However, other videos have emerged showing police firing at protesters from a distance and discussing why “no one has fallen dead”.    NEWSstatesANDHRAKARNATAKAKERALATAMIL NADUTELANGANAFEATURESFLIXVOICESATOMDELVEHEALTHMONEYCoronavirus top      download our new app today  About UsDisclaimerWrite to UsTerms & ConditionsTNM Brand Studio©2020 the news minute Technology Partner  zyxware technologies  \n",

Should we send you a Hindi translation,\" Congress's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a tweet in Hindi. He tagged a news report that said Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal was not ready to accept the CAA in his state. Surjewala earlier dared Modi to dismiss his own chief minister for openly opposing the amended Citizenship Act and declare him an \"anti-national\" for doing so. \"Mr Prime Minister, Stop fooling India! Your own CM is openly opposing CAA. Will you now declare him 'anti national'? I challenge you to dismiss him before criticising the opposition,\" he wrote on Twitter. Sonowal gave a fresh twist to the debate over the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA), after he tweeted, saying, \"As a son of Assam, I will never settle foreigners in my state. This Sarbananda Sonowal will never allow this....\" The Congress has been attacking the BJP-led government over the CAA and its chief ministers have said they would not implement the new citizenship law in their states.

      "\"Your allies are not accepting the divisive CAA, your own chief ministers are not accepting the CAA.

Your own CM is openly opposing CAA. Will you now declare him 'anti national'? I challenge you to dismiss him before criticising the opposition,\" he wrote on Twitter.Sonowal gave a fresh twist to the debate over the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA), after he tweeted, saying, \"As a son of Assam, I will never settle foreigners in my state. This Sarbananda Sonowal will never allow this....\"\r",

Should we send you a Hindi translation,” Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a tweet in Hindi.He tagged a news report that said Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal was not ready to accept the CAA in his state. Surjewala earlier dared Modi to dismiss his own chief minister for openly opposing the amended Citizenship Act and declare him an “anti-national” for doing so. “Mr Prime Minister, Stop fooling India! Your own CM is openly opposing CAA. Will you now declare him ‘anti national’? I challenge you to dismiss him before criticising the opposition,” he wrote on Twitter.Related News'Amethi MP Missing' poster: Smriti Irani questions Sonia Gandhi in scathing reply to Mahila Congress' barbsRajya Sabha election 2020: Polls to 18 seats on June 19, announces Election CommissionLadakh standoff: Take parties, country into confidence over situation on border with China, Congress tells Modi govtSonowal gave a fresh twist to the debate over the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA), after he tweeted, saying, “As a son of Assam, I will never settle foreigners in my state.

Fadnavis said that Balasaheb Thackeray would have never tolerated such words against Savarkar which cannot be expected from Uddhav but we expect an immediate ban on this book. \"Hindu Hruday Samrat Shiv Sena Pramukh Balasaheb Thackeray ji never ever tolerated such dirty words against Savarkar ji. He would’ve been the first to react & that too in his own style. Though we cannot expected that today, we expect an immediate ban on this book by Maharashtra CM,\" he said.The former CM condemed the booklet and demanded to know whether Sena will ban it in Maharashtra by registering strong protest. He said, \"We want answers from Shiv Sena, which has made an unnatural alliance with Congress, if it will ban this book in Maharashtra by registering strong protest or repeatedly tolerate such insults of our most respected personalities just for the greed of power?\"Also ReadMore trouble for MVA?

      "New Delhi [India], Jan 3 (ANI): Mother of a rape victim, who committed suicide last year, on Friday, wrote a letter to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal seeking his help to get justice for her daughter as accused Karan Chandela comes from a family with the strong political clout. Karan Chandela is a nephew of AAP leader, whose husband belongs to a Congress party.  In a letter to Kejriwal, rape victim's mother Smita Dutta urged Kejriwal to look into the matter and not promote leaders with a criminal background.Dutta alleged that no action has been taken by the police as Chandela's family has a stronghold in the area. \"My daughter's friend informed me that Karan Chandela had some intimate videos. He used to blackmail my daughter with those videos. My daughter hanged herself from the fan in the house in my absence when I had gone for some work. Police are not taking the desired action as this family has connections in political corridors apart from having criminal backgrounds,\" she told Kejriwal. She requested the Chief Minister to \"not to promote such anti-social elements as they are not good for the society if empowered by political roles\".Victim's mother alleged that she was not getting the support from the AAP representatives in the area. \"I am not getting any support from the AAP representative in the area and the police. This is why I have written to Kejriwal as he is known for his clean image and for supporting the righteous,\" she told ANI. It is worth mentioning that the rape victim was a famous star on a social media app where she had garnered over 7 lakh followers.Last year in September, police had filed an FIR in the case, however, the accused has not been arrested so far.

ATHIT PERAWONGMETHA / REUTERSArticle Sidebar Share CloseShare this Story: Feyzi Ismail: Protest has helped define the first two decades of the 21st century — here’s what’s next  Copy Link Email Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn TumblrTrendingArticle contentThe first two decades of the 21st century saw the return of mass movements to streets around the world. Partly a product of sinking confidence in mainstream politics, mass mobilization has had a huge impact on both official politics and wider society, and protest has become the form of political expression to which millions of people turn.2019 has ended with protests on a global scale, most notably in Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa, Hong Kong and across India, which has recently flared up against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Citizenship Amendment Act. In some cases protests are explicitly against neo-liberal reforms, or against legal changes that threaten civil liberties. In others they are against inaction over the climate crisis, now driven by a generation of young people new to politics in dozens of countries.We apologize, but this video has failed to load.Try refreshing your browser, ortap here to see other videos from our team.Feyzi Ismail: Protest has helped define the first two decades of the 21st century — here’s what’s next Back to videoAs we end a turbulent two decades of protest — the subject of much of my own teaching and ongoing research — what will be the shape of protest in the 2020s?AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedFollowing moments of open class warfare in the late 1960s and early 1970s, battles against the political and economic order became fragmented, trade unions were attacked, the legacy of the anti-colonial struggles was eroded and the history of the period was recast by the establishment to undermine its potency. In the post-Cold War era, a new phase of protest finally began to overcome these defeats.This revival of protest exploded onto the political scene most visibly in Seattle outside the World Trade Organization summit in 1999. If 1968 was one of the high points of radical struggle in the 20th century, protest in the early 2000s once again began to reflect a general critique of the capitalist system, with solidarity forged across different sections of society.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedA young protester from Vancouver stands in front of a line of riot police during the Seattle World Trade Organization protests of 1999. Ian Lindsay/Postmedia News filesThe birth of the antiglobalization movement in Seattle was followed by extraordinary mobilizations outside gatherings of the global economic elite. Alternative spaces were also created for the global justice movement to connect, most notably the World Social Forums (WSFs), starting with Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2001. It was here that questions over what position the antiglobalization movement should take over the Iraq War, for example, were discussed and debated. Though the WSFs provided an important rallying point for a time, they ultimately evaded politics.The global antiwar movement led to the biggest co-ordinated demonstrations in the history of protest on Feb. 15, 2003, in which millions of people demonstrated in over 800 cities, creating a crisis of democracy around the U.S. and U.K.-led intervention in Iraq.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedIn the years leading up to and following the banking crisis of 2008, food riots and anti-austerity protests escalated around the world. In parts of the Middle East and North Africa, protests achieved insurrectionary proportions, with the overthrow of one dictator after another. After the Arab Spring was thwarted by counter-revolution, the Occupy movement and then Black Lives Matter gained global attention. While the public, urban square became a central focus for protest, social media became an important — but by no means exclusive — organizing tool.To varying degrees, these movements sharply raised the question of political transformation but didn’t find new ways of institutionalizing popular power. The result was that in a number of situations, protest movements fell back on widely distrusted parliamentary processes to try and pursue their political aims. The results of this parliamentary turn have not been impressive.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedOn the one hand, the first two decades of the 21st century have seen soaring inequality, accompanied by debt and the neglect of working people. On the other, there have been poor results from purely parliamentary attempts to challenge it. There is, in other words, a deep crisis of representation.The inability of modern capitalism to deliver more than survival for many has combined with a general critique of neo-liberal capitalism to create a situation in which wider and wider sections of society are being drawn into protest. More than a million people have poured onto the streets of Lebanon since mid-October and protests continue despite a violent crackdown by security forces.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedAt the same time, people are less and less willing to accept unrepresentative politicians — and this is likely to continue in the future. From Lebanon and Iraq to Chile and Hong Kong, mass mobilizations continue despite resignations and concessions.In Britain, the Labour Party’s defeat in the recent general election is attributed largely to its failure to accept the 2016 referendum result over EU membership. Decades of loyalty to the Labour Party for many and a socialist leader in Jeremy Corbyn calling for an end to austerity couldn’t cut through to enough of the millions who voted for Brexit.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedIn France, a general strike in December 2019 over President Emmanuel Macron’s proposed pension reforms has revealed the extent of opposition that people feel toward his government. This comes barely a year after the start of the Yellow Vest movement, in which people have protested against fuel price hikes and the precariousness of their lives.The tendency toward street protest will be encouraged too by the climate crisis, whose effects mean that the most heavily exploited, including along race and gender lines, have the most to lose. When the protests in Lebanon broke out, they were taking place alongside rampant wildfires.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedAs protesters gain experience, they consciously bring to the fore questions of leadership and organization. In Lebanon and Iraq there has already been a conscious effort to overcome traditional sectarian divides. Debates are also raging in protest movements from Algeria to Chile about how to fuse economic and political demands in a more strategic manner. The goal is to make political and economic demands inseparable, such that it’s impossible for a government to make political concessions without making economic ones too.As the 2020s begin, it’s clear we’re living in an unprecedented moment: a climate emergency and ecological breakdown, a brewing global financial crisis, deepening inequality, trade wars, and growing threats of more imperialist wars and militarization.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedThere has also been a resurgence of the far right in many countries, emboldened most visibly by parties and politicians in the U.S., Brazil, India and many parts of Europe. This resurgence, however, has not gone unchallenged.The convergence of crisis on these multiple fronts will reach breaking point, creating conditions that will become intolerable for most people. This will galvanize more protest and more polarization. As governments respond with reforms, such measures on their own will be unlikely to meet the combination of political and economic demands. The question of how to create new vehicles of representation to assert popular control over the economy will keep emerging. The fortunes of popular protest may well depend on whether the collective leadership of the movements can provide answers to it.Feyzi Ismail is a senior teaching fellow at the University of LondonThis article originally appeared online attheconversation.com, an independent source of news and views, from the academic and research community.Letters to the editor should be sent to sunletters@vancouversun.com. CLICK HERE to report a typo.Is there more to this story?

The police did not register a case against the doctor after he apologised to the family of the victim. The police said the minor girl had gone to the clinic of the doctor with her mother to get medicines. They said the doctor took the minor girl inside the cabin of his clinic and asked her mother to wait outside. The police said after the doctor started touching the private parts of the girl inappropriately, she raised an alarm. The police said the mother-daughter duo later called other family members who allegedly beat up the doctor, who was in an inebriated condition. The family members of the minor girl later brought the doctor to the police station. The investigating officer said the family members of the girl did not record a statement, so a case had not been registered. He said the doctor apologised to the family of the minor girl.

      "New Delhi [India], Jan 4 (ANI): A Delhi court on Saturday extended the judicial custody of 11 accused who were arrested after a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the Seemapuri area turned violent in mid-December.Metropolitan Magistrate Snigdha Sarvaruya sent them to judicial custody till January 18. The court also directed that a wheel-chair should be provided to an accused named Amriuddin.The Delhi Police had on December 31 transferred the case to a special investigating team (SIT).The Police had arrested eleven people in connection with the protests in the area. Subsequently, they were sent to 14-days judicial custody on December 21 and were produced before the court today at the end of their remand period.One of the accused had earlier claimed that he was a juvenile but after the ossification test was conducted, the court found him not to be a minor.On December 28, senior advocate Nitya Ramakrishna told the court that there is no evidence to ascertain that his clients had the intention to kill anyone and hence could not be charged with Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

I enjoy coming to school because a lot of activities are being conducted by the teachers in the class under the entrepreneurship mindset curriculum. These activities work as stressbusters for me because I have to appear for my board exams this year and sometimes I feel overstressed, said Shweta.However, she felt that in order to make learning more interesting and comprehensive there should be smart classes in her school.Another class 10 student Surabhi said. \"My teacher brings tab and speakers and plays motivational videos. Sometimes she gives us a random topic on which we speak impromptu in the class. She also teaches from the book provided to her for the entrepreneurship class. These activities have taught me that if your mind is cool, you can perform better and achieve more.\"Surabhi's mother Rupam Suman said \"the PTM gives me an opportunity to know my daughter's progress. Education has improved a lot in the government schools. I have observed that various activities are conducted in the school which are helpful in releasing stress, especially for her as she has to appear for board exams.\"The Principal of the school, Asha Kumar, said that it is really good that the government is organising such events.\"I have observed the evolution, changes and many government policy interventions in the field of education during my career but such events were never organised. By organising such events, a gap between the teachers, students and their parents has been filled. Most importantly teachers encourage and praise children in front of their parents, therefore, they don't feel scared rather they are motivated,\" said Kumar.Kumar said \"The reasons, apart from studies, why children are turning up in schools are: mid-day meal, happiness and entrepreneurship activities. There has been a tremendous change in the attitude of the children too due to happiness and entrepreneurship activities. They have become more expressive and less hesitant in sharing their views.\"She said such activities are important to make kids confident as most of them are from middle or lower class and suffer from inferiority complex.\"We have also started taking students for educational tours in as well as outside Delhi as per the government policy. Recently, we went to Delhi-Jaipur and Bharatpur for a three day tour. It is great to see that the focus of the government is completely on quality education. Such events should not be stopped; in fact, they should happen in a much organised manner,\" said Kumar.A Hindi teacher said that some teachers from the staff only take happiness and entrepreneurship classes where they conduct activities like group discussion, storytelling, poetry recitation, peer group activities and skits.\"Happiness is being taught up to class 8 whereas entrepreneurship is taught from class 9-12. Books have been provided to teach both. These initiatives invoke the interest of parents as well as students to attend the PTM,\" said the Hindi teacher.      \n",

      "\n",
      "In a battle that has spanned over the last decade, a retired chief commissioner of income tax (I-T) and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) have been at loggerheads over water charges in the former’s property tax bill. And now, bringing the citizen civic body disagreement to a head, PMC has slapped a notice of property attachment on 70-year-old Undri resident AJ Khan for unpaid tax dues of many years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entire tussle was sparked after the former I-T chief commissioner had pointed out that PMC’s water pipeline has not yet reached his area, questioning why residents were still being charged for water under property tax bills. In this light, he had also sent a legal notice to the civic body in 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Friday last week, however, he finally received his response. A notice for property attachment was directly pasted outside his bungalow in Paradise Villa complex dated December 27, 2019, asking Khan to pay Rs 10,36,104 within 15 days of notice’s issuance date.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan (inset) moved into a Paradise Villa bungalow in 2010; he sent legal notices to PMC in 2018, 2019 to omit water charges from his property tax\n",
      "However, Khan has decided to go ahead and fight a legal battle against PMC, saying his stand is clear — the corporation has been charging for water it is not providing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan narrated that he moved into the bungalow complex on NIBM-Undri Road in 2010, after he retired from his top post out of Pune’s I-T office. Speaking to Mirror, he shared, “After moving here, I realised that there was no water supply from PMC in our area. We were forced to be totally dependent on private water tankers for daily supply. While I was getting over the shock of the civic body not providing this essential resource, in October 2010, I got a property tax bill from PMC, divided under various headers of services we had to pay for. One of the categories was water supply charges. I took objection to this and soon wrote a complaint letter to PMC, stating that it should ideally remove water supply charges from the overall tax.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The former I-T chief commissioner claimed he did not receive any reply from officials about this complaint. “Even though I was ignored, I persisted and kept on filing complaints. Years later, in 2016, I managed to meet then-PMC commissioner Kunal Kumar, who assured me that my grievances would be addressed,” said Khan.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to him, a couple of days after meeting Kumar, a team of PMC employees from the water department visited their area and carried out a survey. “Thereafter, I received a letter from PMC saying it would take two years for their water pipelines to reach our locality,” added Khan.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, even after a wait of two years, there was no sign of PMC’s water pipeline in his locality, after which Khan finally sent a legal notice to the civic body in 2018. “The notice was addressed to the PMC commissioner, but there was no response. I waited for some time and sent yet another notice to PMC in August this year,” said the septuagenarian.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this time, the response he got was the property attachment notice. “I was shocked to see it pasted outside my bungalow. PMC has asked me to pay over Rs 10 lakh, which includes the outstanding property tax and interest on it. This is such arrogant behaviour — sending me a notice instead of addressing the issue and providing water to us which we pay for!” he emphasised.\n",
      "\n",
      "When contacted about the development, PMC property tax department head Vilas Kanade reasoned, “The civic administration collects tax as per decisions taken in the general body meeting. While we impose tax in areas where there is inadequate water supply, we apply a concessional rate there as compared to other city areas. As far as this case is concerned, I will look into it and try to help him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan further clarified that he is in no way against paying property tax, but merely wishes to have water charges removed. “I am ready to pay the rest. If I do not have a PMC water pipeline yet, why should I pay for the resource they are not providing?” he challenged.\n",

emergency...ICMR-AIIMS emergency mobile service initiative sees expansion By Medical Dialogues BureauPublished On 1 Jan 2020 11:10 AM GMT  |  Updated On  1 Jan 2020 11:10 AM GMTNew Delhi: People living within a 5-km radius of the AIIMS can now avail an emergency mobile medical service in case of anyone suffering heart attack or chest pain with the authorities expanding the initiative''s reach, officials said.The facility, a joint initiative of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), was launched in April and was earlier available within an radius of 3 km.Under ''Mission DELHI'' (Delhi Emergency Life Heart-Attack Initiative), a pair of motorcycle-borne trained paramedic nurses are the first responders for treating heart attack patients.The initiative has so far received 44 cases.\"The project has now been extended to 78 sq km around AIIMS, New Delhi and will now cater to a population of 20-25 lakhs in the national capital,\" Dr Chandni Suvarna, a scientist at AIIMS, said.On receiving a call at Mission Delhi''s toll-free emergency helpline numbers (1800111044 and 14430), the mobile medical nurse team is dispatched immediately for examining the patient, providing necessary medication/CPR, transmitting ECG to consultant at AIIMS.While the emergency treatment is being provided, a CATS ambulance will arrive and take the patient for further treatment.Even as the patient is on way to the hospital, doctors at AIIMS control centre will evaluate the data received from the nurses to establish further course of treatment.The ICMR has signed a memorandum with CATS (Centralized Ambulance Trauma Services) for this project.\"With bike-ambulances and trained nurses, Mission Delhi focuses on the importance of reaching with the medical help much faster, timely response and doorstep care saving the heart in time, given the high-density traffic conditions in the city where the movement of four-wheeler ambulances becomes difficult,\" Suvarna said.An ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) heart attack is an acute, high risk, time-sensitive life-threatening disease. The management of STEMI heart attack patient requires treatment to be started within the golden hour (90 minutes) of the onset of symptoms and providing clot buster therapy to patient within 30 minutes of reaching the hospital.Delays in reaching hospital and initiation of clot-buster therapy are the major causes of deaths in STEMI heart attack patients.According to AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria, the idea has been tried in remote areas of the country but not specifically for reaching those with heart trouble. Guleria earlier said the attempt is to reach patients within 10 minutes.The heart is like a room that pumps blood to the entire body. Before the blood is pumped to the body, it is pumped to the walls of the heart through three pipes (coronary arteries). If any of these pipes are clogged by clot, the tissues in that part of the heart die.It is important to remove the clot that is stopping the blood flow. If the heart walls are damaged, they cannot be repaired. Clot busters are almost equal to angioplasty.The average age of the occurrence of cardiac arrest in the Indian population is 53 to 55 years, about 10 years less than in the United States and Europe where it is 63 or 64.Genetic predisposition is an important cause for this but, the high rates of smoking and chewing tobacco in India also contribute in a large way.Ninety per cent of chewing tobacco prevalence in the world is in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Young heart patients that doctors see mostly have problems associated with tobacco use.extended heart attack patients mobile emergency care Medical Dialogues BureauMedical Dialogues Bureau consists of a team of passionate medical/scientific writers, led by doctors and healthcare researchers.  Our team efforts to bring you updated and timely news about the important happenings of the medical and healthcare sector.

      "New Delhi [India], Jan 1 (ANI): The Delhi High Court has dismissed a petition of school teacher seeking registration of an FIR against a senior police official of Uttarakhand under alleged charges of sexual assault, house trespass, and extortion, observing that woman had failed to explain delay in complaining the matter. Justice Brijesh Sethi, in his recent order, observed that the woman petitioner has mentioned the date of the alleged incident as November 2016. However, she has filed a complaint regarding the same through a post on June 5, 2017. \"There is inordinate delay in filing the complaint and there is no explanation for the same,\" the court said.The court was hearing the woman appeal challenging a trial court order which had dismissed her plea seeking lodging of FIR against a senior Uttarakhand police official.According to the woman complainant, due to the threat of the accused, the petitioner was compelled to execute sale deed of a property in favour of the accused of consideration of around Rs. 23 lakh. She further submitted that in the month of November 2016, the accused had come to the petitioner's residence in South Delhi with some police guard and hired criminals and at gunpoint demanded Rs. 10 lakh.The petitioner, had thereafter, asked her mother-in-law to give him Rs 10 lakh. The petitioner's mother-in-law had given three cheques totalling Rs. 10 lakhs in favour of one memorial foundation.It was further alleged that the accused had wrongfully restrained the petitioner's husband and also assaulted the petitioner with intent to create terror in the mind of the family members. It was also alleged that the accused also harassed the Petitioner's son, who is a Canadian citizen and threatened him that he will put him in Jail.She further alleged that besides extortion, the accused also sexually and physically assaulted, wrongfully restrained and threatened the petitioner and her other family members with dire consequences.The High Court observed that so far the allegations of extortion is concerned, the trial court has rightly observed that no prudent man will receive extortion money through the cheques.\"In these circumstances, there is no illegality or irregularity in the order dated November 28, 2018, passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, South-East, Saket Courts, New Delhi. The petition filed by the petitioner is, therefore, dismissed,\" the High Court said. (ANI)\n",

However, she has filed a complaint regarding the same through a post on June 5, 2017. \"There is inordinate delay in filing the complaint and there is no explanation for the same,\" the court said.The court was hearing the woman appeal challenging a trial court order which had dismissed her plea seeking lodging of FIR against a senior Uttarakhand police official.According to the woman complainant, due to the threat of the accused, the petitioner was compelled to execute sale deed of a property in favour of the accused of consideration of around Rs. 23 lakh. She further submitted that in the month of November 2016, the accused had come to the petitioner's residence in South Delhi with some police guard and hired criminals and at gunpoint demanded Rs. 10 lakh.The petitioner, had thereafter, asked her mother-in-law to give him Rs 10 lakh. The petitioner's mother-in-law had given three cheques totalling Rs. 10 lakhs in favour of one memorial foundation.It was further alleged that the accused had wrongfully restrained the petitioner's husband and also assaulted the petitioner with intent to create terror in the mind of the family members. It was also alleged that the accused also harassed the Petitioner's son, who is a Canadian citizen and threatened him that he will put him in Jail.She further alleged that besides extortion, the accused also sexually and physically assaulted, wrongfully restrained and threatened the petitioner and her other family members with dire consequences.The High Court observed that so far the allegations of extortion is concerned, the trial court has rightly observed that no prudent man will receive extortion money through the cheques.\"In these circumstances, there is no illegality or irregularity in the order dated November 28, 2018, passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, South-East, Saket Courts, New Delhi. The petition filed by the petitioner is, therefore, dismissed,\" the High Court said. (ANI)     \n",

      "Ever since Parliament passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, earlier this month, India has seen widespread protests. These protests have involved political parties, civil society, and student groups, as well as large number of ordinary Muslim citizens. Many of these protests have been marred by violence, involving the destruction of public property and clashes between police and protesters.However, the police in many states have also been accused of using excessive force on protesters. In Uttar Pradesh, there are reports and allegations that the police targeted Muslim protesters, even attacking some Muslim neighbourhoods and houses. To be sure, there is another side to the story — Uttar Pradesh police officials have spoken of large, well-organised mobs, intent on violence, and armed with guns in some cases. Still, this is a good time to remember the findings from the Status of Policing in India report, released earlier this year by Common Cause and CSDS-Lokniti, which showed that the police in India suffers from inadequacies and biases which might lead to such behaviour. The report said that large sections of the police force are not trained to care about human rights, believed that use of violence is justified against criminal elements, and are more prejudiced against the Muslims in believing that the community was naturally prone towards committing crimes. The report is based on a survey conducted across 21 states.It showed that in Assam and Uttar Pradesh, two of the states which witnessed multiple protests in the last two weeks, 31% and 19% personnel never received training in human rights. Assam also tops the states in share of personnel who did not receive training in caste sensitisation and crowd control.Even among the personnel who received training in any of the three modules, a majority received the training only at the time of joining the police force. This study said that was also true for those who were in the police force for more than five years. (See Chart 1) The survey data further suggested an inherent prejudice existed among police personnel against various socio-religious communities, but largely against Muslims. For instance, when asked to what extent were people from several communities naturally prone towards committing crimes,  50% police personnel said Muslims were “very much” or “somewhat” naturally prone towards committing crimes. This figure was under 35% in case of Dalits, tribal communities, “upper-caste” Hindus and people from the other backward classes. (See Chart 2)Uttar Pradesh was among the eight states where a majority of the police personnel surveyed showed this bias against Muslims. It was the highest in Uttarakhand at 79%. Uttar Pradesh was also among the states where the survey found a majority of personnel having a similar prejudice against Dalits.The need for training in human rights also gains significance as the survey found a large number of police personnel had the inclination to use extrajudicial measures against criminals  over a legal trail. Three in every  four police personnel surveyed felt it was justified for the police to be violent towards criminals, while one in five felt that killing dangerous criminals was better than a legal trial. To be sure, more educated police personnel, who are more likely to be officers, were found to be more likely to believe that it was alright for the police to be violent towards criminals. (See Chart 3).\n",

      "Barely a month after Lokesh was born, he was diagnosed with Pure Red Cell Aplasia, a rare blood disorder. It was a bolt from the blue for his parents, B. Ravi, a daily wage labourer, and B. Surekha, a small-time tailor, especially since doctors warned them of the dangers unless he was put on medication, lifelong. Lokesh is now 17 and Surekha a widow — Ravi died of a heart attack in February 2017. Since Ravi’s death, it has been more difficult than ever to continue her son’s treatment on her ₹3,000 income, what with two other children — another son and a daughter — to look after. The four live in a government-sanctioned house in Abdullapurmet, Hayatnagar. She also gets ₹2,000 pension from the government, but even with that, managing daily expenses and Lokesh’s medical care has been nothing short of a struggle. Worse, she has to repay several outstanding loans. Due to the financial crisis, she had to dig into her lifetime savings and take more loans from relatives. Despite all of it, she could not continue paying her children’s school fees as a result of which her elder son had to drop out of school. Lokesh, too, had to discontinue education as teachers asked that he have someone by his side throughout the duration of school hours. Her daughter, however, continues going to a government school. “Lokesh’s medicines for a month cost around ₹4,000. He needs two rounds of blood transfusion too. We have to spend ₹1,000 to travel between home and the blood bank. I stopped taking loans as people started questioning how I intend to repay it. I request people to donate money for his treatment or buy us the medicines so that my son can live,” says Surekha. When at one point, Surekha could not afford to buy medicines for two months, Lokesh’s health started declining. “His iron levels increased and doctors said we have to continue the medicines to avoid further risks to his life. If someone helps us with our medical expenses, my son can be saved,” she adds, appealing for help.Those willing to donate money can send it to B. Surekha (Andhra Bank, Chikadpally branch, Hyderabad; bank account number: 007610100054512, IFSC: ANDB0000076) or contact her on 86867-29184. \n",

And now, bringing the citizen civic body disagreement to a head, PMC has slapped a notice of property attachment on 70-year-old Undri resident AJ Khan for unpaid tax dues of many years.\\n\\nThe entire tussle was sparked after the former I-T chief commissioner had pointed out that PMC’s water pipeline has not yet reached his area, questioning why residents were still being charged for water under property tax bills. In this light, he had also sent a legal notice to the civic body in 2018.\\n\\nOn Friday last week, however, he finally received his response. A notice for property attachment was directly pasted outside his bungalow in Paradise Villa complex dated December 27, 2019, asking Khan to pay Rs 10,36,104 within 15 days of notice’s issuance date.\\n\\n\\nKhan (inset) moved into a Paradise Villa bungalow in 2010; he sent legal notices to PMC in 2018, 2019 to omit water charges from his property tax\\nHowever, Khan has decided to go ahead and fight a legal battle against PMC, saying his stand is clear — the corporation has been charging for water it is not providing.\\n\\nKhan narrated that he moved into the bungalow complex on NIBM-Undri Road in 2010, after he retired from his top post out of Pune’s I-T office. Speaking to Mirror, he shared, “After moving here, I realised that there was no water supply from PMC in our area. We were forced to be totally dependent on private water tankers for daily supply. While I was getting over the shock of the civic body not providing this essential resource, in October 2010, I got a property tax bill from PMC, divided under various headers of services we had to pay for. One of the categories was water supply charges. I took objection to this and soon wrote a complaint letter to PMC, stating that it should ideally remove water supply charges from the overall tax.”\\n\\nThe former I-T chief commissioner claimed he did not receive any reply from officials about this complaint. “Even though I was ignored, I persisted and kept on filing complaints. Years later, in 2016, I managed to meet then-PMC commissioner Kunal Kumar, who assured me that my grievances would be addressed,” said Khan.\\n\\nAccording to him, a couple of days after meeting Kumar, a team of PMC employees from the water department visited their area and carried out a survey. “Thereafter, I received a letter from PMC saying it would take two years for their water pipelines to reach our locality,” added Khan.\\n\\nBut, even after a wait of two years, there was no sign of PMC’s water pipeline in his locality, after which Khan finally sent a legal notice to the civic body in 2018. “The notice was addressed to the PMC commissioner, but there was no response. I waited for some time and sent yet another notice to PMC in August this year,” said the septuagenarian.\\n\\nBut this time, the response he got was the property attachment notice. “I was shocked to see it pasted outside my bungalow. PMC has asked me to pay over Rs 10 lakh, which includes the outstanding property tax and interest on it. This is such arrogant behaviour — sending me a notice instead of addressing the issue and providing water to us which we pay for!” he emphasised.\\n\\nWhen contacted about the development, PMC property tax department head Vilas Kanade reasoned, “The civic administration collects tax as per decisions taken in the general body meeting. While we impose tax in areas where there is inadequate water supply, we apply a concessional rate there as compared to other city areas. As far as this case is concerned, I will look into it and try to help him.”\\n\\nKhan further clarified that he is in no way against paying property tax, but merely wishes to have water charges removed. “I am ready to pay the rest. If I do not have a PMC water pipeline yet, why should I pay for the resource they are not providing?” he challenged.\\n\\nRELATED NEWSPeople decry PCMC’s property tax mandate to reopen their shopsMay 14, 2020Date for filing income tax returns extended till November 30, 2020: F...May 13, 2020COVID-19: Income Tax department to immediately issue pending refunds ...Apr 08, 2020\\n  $0 fee* to send money to IndiaCIBC Global Money Transfer™She lost her husband and now cancer is killing her only son.KETTOMen, you don't need the pill if you do this once daily.Vital AlphaSteve Harvey's heartbreaking announcement.HEATPEAK1 Brilliant Tip Reverses Years of Aging (Dermatologists Speechless)Growth AdviceThis Simple After-Dinner Ritual Might Help You Get Rid of Stubborn Body Fat!The Daily Survivor 8 held for hosting welcome rally for murder accusedPune MirrorMaharashtra govt issues guidelines for unlock 1.0Pune Mirror8 deaths, 285 new cases found in distPune Mirror \\n $0 fee* to send money to IndiaCIBC Global Money Transfer™I can’t arrange Rs 33.80 lakh for my son’s transplant.
