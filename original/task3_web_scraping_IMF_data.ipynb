The weaker demand in the global market will also reduce Egypt’s exports as well as earnings from the Suez Canal. The authorities have taken a host of precautionary measures to improve testing as well as to limit the community spread of the virus, including setting up testing centers, temporarily closing places of worship, temporarily halting all air travel, and encouraging civil servants to work from home in non-essential sectors. The central bank and the government are actively implementing measures to contain economic implications of the epidemic. </p>\n",

The National Election Board of Ethiopia is reviewing the feasibility of conducting elections, scheduled for August 29. Ethiopia is highly exposed to the shock through the large contribution of air transportation to exports: the national carrier, Ethiopian Airlines, which has the largest fleet in Africa, announced the suspension of flights to 30 countries and has reported sharp losses. Flower exports to Europe have also declined significantly due to lack of demand and closure of airports on the continent. Finally, while Ethiopia benefits from lower oil prices, the prices on its main export commodities such as coffee and oil seeds have been adversely impacted by the crisis.</p>\n",

Commercial banks are assisting their customers affected by the COVID-19 virus on a case by case basis and depending on individual customers’ circumstances by: (i) reducing or suspending the principal loan repayments to interest only loan repayments; (ii) restructuring loans to businesses that have reduced business hours, in affected sectors such as tourism and related industries like transportation and to individuals who have been laid off; (iii) extending the terms of loans to reduce repayments; (iv) reducing loan interest rates on a case by case basis; and (v) providing access to short-term funding, if required. The NRBT is also building awareness and expectations through press releases. </p>\n",

There is a dire need for testing kits, medical consumables, as well as other clinical equipment and medication, to prepare for the confirmation/arrival and treatment of COVID-19. The support for the private sector includes: a temporary exemption on import duties on most commonly bought food items for households; duty concessions to be applied to an expanded list of agricultural and fishing materials; a grace period of three months to be applied for all loan payments; and a six-month moratorium on pension contributions for the hospitality sector. Support for citizens includes: establishment of the Emergency Price Control Board to keep wholesale and retail prices in check and bring them down, if necessary; provision of financial assistance to members of the National Provident Fund in the form of a refund of their loan payments for March 2020; and a temporary reduction of utility bills (both electricity and water) for six months through September 2020. </p>\n",
